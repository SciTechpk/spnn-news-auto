Following the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan on May 9, 2023, from the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours. Protesters vandalised and torched government buildings and military installations, while also breaking into the residence of the Lahore corps commander. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing several other cases against Imran and party leaders since the events of May 9.
Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.
Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik, the lead defence counsel, confirmed today’s sentencing to Dawn.com.
He said Yasmin, former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema were among those sentenced to 10 years in prison. The others were Khalid Qayyum, Riyaz Hussain, Ali Hassan and Afzal Azeem Pahat.
Addressing a press conference soon after the development emerged, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there was now “an addition to the controversial cases of Pakistan’s judiciary” after today’s legal developments.
Noting Qureshi’s acquittal, he said Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin, Mian Mian Mehmoodur and Cheema were sentenced to 10 years “without fulfilling the requirements of the law”.
He criticised the jail trial proceedings and said it would not bode well for the country, causing public disillusionment in the courts.
Blasting the verdict, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said an “edifice of lies” was constructed and the matter no longer concerned just the party but the entire nation, saying that institutions and courts were being destroyed.
He called the verdict a “joke and attack on democracy”.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik welcomed the development while speaking on Geo News. “These people were using delaying tactics,” he said.
Malik said due process and a fair trial process was followed and all evidence on record was considered by the judge, saying that the verdict was in line with the law and the Constitution.
The ATC had heard the concluding arguments of the prosecution and defence in the jail trial proceedings of the case a day ago.
Deputy Prosecutor General Abdul Jabbar Dogar had presented final arguments, saying the “May 9 conspiracy” was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park. He said it had already been decided what actions were to be taken in case of the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.
He alleged that on May 9, according to the plan, party leaders incited the workers. He said the witnesses to the conspiracy had recorded their statements before the court. He said these witnesses were present during the meeting of the PTI leaders held at Zaman Park, the residence of the former prime minister.
The prosecutor stated that 61 witnesses of the attacks and vandalism incidents had testified in the trial. Therefore, he said, in the light of the documents, evidence and the witness statements, the accused persons should be convicted.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/222330148341e81.jpg?r=233415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925885/man-kills-daughter-nephew-in-quetta-days-after-degari-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>Man kills daughter, nephew in Quetta days after Degari ‘honour killing’ case</strong></a><br><p>A man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta on Tuesday in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the Degari case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.
Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told Dawn.com, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”
The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.
Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.
“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.
The incident comes two days after the police  arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’
The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.
Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, APP added.
The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure swift action against the culprits of the Degari incident and deliver appropriate punishment.
MPA Shahida Rauf decried the incident as barbaric and criticised unauthorised “Jirgas” for dispensing unlawful judgments, calling for tougher legislation and accountability.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti proposed forming a parliamentary committee to monitor the investigation and ensure transparency in the dual murder case.
Education Minister Rahila Hameed Durrani emphasised the psychological impact of the incident across society and noted that while it occurred before Eid, it only recently gained public attention after circulating online.
Adviser Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.
Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour. He strongly opposed vigilante justice.
MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.
She criticised unequal enforcement of law and challenged patriarchal norms surrounding honour.
Minister Haji Noor Muhammad Dummar called for decisive actions to prevent future tragedies, stating no one has the right to claim lives in the name of tradition.
The resolution was adopted unanimously after a thorough and impassioned debate.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615309-dr-yasmin-rashid-among-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-year-imprisonment-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid among PTI leaders sentenced to 10-year imprisonment in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

The PTI announced the death in a post on X and extended its condolences to his son and party leader, Hammad Azhar.
 






Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan praised him as a person of “noble character” whose “political and national services” would be remembered for a long time.
 






Former Sindh governor and ex-PTI leader Imran Ismail said he was deeply saddened to hear of the death and praised the deceased as a “distinguished political figure”.
 






He was the governor of Punjab from August 11, 1990, till April 10, 1993.
He was also the founding president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and joined the PTI in October 2011.
He was the PTI-backed candidate in the February 2024 general elections for NA-129(Lahore-XIII) and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council later on.
In January 2024, he was also taken into custody in Lahore only to be released after a few hours as police launched a crackdown on PTI-affiliated candidates and supporters who took to the streets on party founder Imran Khan’s call.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615300-minor-student-beaten-to-death-by-madrassa-teachers-in-swat' target='_blank'><strong>Minor student beaten to death by madrassa teachers in Swat</strong></a><br><p>

Ashraf hit an aggressive 32-ball 51 while debutant Daniyal smashed an 11-ball 17 but holed out off the second ball of the final over as Pakistan were all out for 125 in their chase of 134 to win in Dhaka.
Earlier, Jaker Ali struck a 48-ball 55 as Bangladesh — sent in to bat — were bowled out for 133 in 20 overs, with Salman Mirza taking 2-17 and Daniyal close behind on 2-23.
Left-arm Bangladesh pacer Shoriful Islam picked up his best T20I figures of 3-17 on a slow-paced Mirpur pitch as Pakistan lost their first five wickets for just 15 runs by the fifth over.
Ashraf cracked four sixes and as many boundaries to raise hopes of a comeback win, but spinner Rishad Hossain bowled him in the penultimate over.
Ashraf and Abbas Afridi, who scored a 13-ball 19, had revived the innings from 47-7 with a 41-run stand, but Bangladesh had the last laugh.
Bangladesh won the first match at the same venue by seven wickets and took an unassailable 2-0 lead with the final match on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
This was Bangladesh’s first T20I series win over Pakistan in four tries.
Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub to a run out for one in the first over before Islam dismissed Fakhar Zaman (8) and Mohammad Haris (0) to hit Pakistan hard at the top.
Bangladesh skipper Litton Das praised a team effort.
“It’s wonderful to win back-to-back series,” said Litton, who also led the team to a 2-1 T20I series in Sri Lanka last week. “This shows good improvement in our standards.”
Pakistan captain Salman Agha rued his side’s batting lapses.
“We thought 134 would be gettable but we lost too many wickets early on and that’s something we must address quickly,” said Agha.
Earlier, Jaker smashed five sixes and a boundary for his third T20I half century.
Bangladesh had lost four wickets for 28 by the sixth over before Jaker and Mahedi Hasan revived the innings with a 53-run stand for the fifth wicket.
Mahedi scored a 25-ball 33 with two sixes and as many boundaries.
The final match is on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
Last month, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh in a three-match home T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Das-led Bangladesh came into the series on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series triumph over Sri Lanka.
Pakistan are visiting Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.
This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as president of the UNSC for July.
The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on “Strengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” was a noteworthy development since it was an “important contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means”.
It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.
“The resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.
“Member states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”
The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.
“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”
 






Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.
It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.
He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.
FM Dar, UN chief call attention towards Gaza
Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”
He added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.
“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.
 






On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.
Dar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”
The Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”
 






UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.
Guterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.
“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.
Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.
He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.
“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.
“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.
“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.
Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.

The withdrawal from the Paris-based agency, which was founded after World War Two to promote peace through international cooperation in education, science, and culture, will take effect on December 31, 2026.
“President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco — which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said.
The State Department said remaining in Unesco was not in the national interest, accusing it of having “a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy”.
Unesco chief Audrey Azoulay said she deeply regretted Trump’s decision, but that it was “expected, and Unesco has prepared for it”.
The agency had diversified its sources of funding, receiving only about eight per cent of its budget from Washington, she said.
 






Unesco was one of several international bodies Trump withdrew from during his first term, along with the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement global climate change accord and the UN Human Rights Council. During his second term, he has largely reinstated those steps.
Unesco officials said the US withdrawal would have some limited impact on programmes the United States was financing.
Tensions?
Israel welcomed the US decision to quit Unesco.
The US State Department said one of the reasons for the withdrawal was Unesco’s decision to admit Palestine as a member state, which was “contrary to US policy and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organisation”.
Unesco officials said all relevant agency statements had been agreed with both Israel and the Palestinians over the past eight years.
“The reasons put forward by the United States to withdraw from the organisation are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and Unesco today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism,” Azoulay said.
“These claims also contradict the reality of Unesco’s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.”
 
 

Diplomats said it was felt at Unesco that the withdrawal was inevitable for political reasons, given that Biden had brought the US back and had promised to repay arrears from the first time Trump pulled out.
Unesco, whose full name is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, is best known for designating World Heritage Sites, including the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria.
The US initially joined Unesco at its founding in 1945 but withdrew for the first time in 1984 in protest against alleged financial mismanagement and perceived anti-US bias, returning in 2003 under then-president George W Bush, who said the agency had undertaken needed reforms.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22185610f6d6709.jpg?r=185643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925874/qatar-bids-to-host-2036-olympic-games' target='_blank'><strong>Qatar bids to host 2036 Olympic Games</strong></a><br><p>Doha is bidding to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games, authorities said on Tuesday, as the wealthy Gulf state sets its sights on yet another major sport event to diversify its energy-reliant economy.
One of the smallest and wealthiest states in the Gulf, Qatar had already hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Should it be chosen, Qatar would become the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to host the Olympic Games, said Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani.
“The official bid submitted by the Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games represents a new milestone in Qatar’s journey,” he said in a statement shared on the official Qatar News Agency.
“The bid builds on Qatar’s proven track record of successfully hosting major international sporting events, most notably the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022,” Sheikh Mohammed added.
Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.
QOC President Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al-Thani said Doha had “made sport a central pillar of our national strategy”.
“We currently have 95 per cent of the required sports infrastructure in place to host the Games, and we have a comprehensive national plan to ensure 100pc readiness of all facilities,” he said.
Countries are no longer required to make their Olympic bids public. The Games are meant to rotate continents every season.
With the 2024, 2028, and 2032 editions set for Europe, North America, and Oceania, there are high chances the 2036 Olympic Games will be held in Asia — or in Africa, which would be a first.
Choosing the next host of the games will be the first major project for the International Olympic Committee’s new president, Kirsty Coventry, who last month became the first woman to lead the body.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615258-arms-liquor-case-court-adjourns-hearing-as-gandapur-assures-to-record-testimony' target='_blank'><strong>Arms, liquor case: Court adjourns hearing as Gandapur assures to record testimony</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in the district’s surrounding areas on Monday following a successful intelligence-based operation on Saturday in which four terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan, were killed.
“During the conduct of the operation, four more terrorists of Fitna al-Hindustan were hunted down and successfully neutralised.
“Terrorist hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered,” the ISPR said of the sanitisation operation.
It added that security forces remained determined to “thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan”.
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for eliminating the eight terrorists, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The president said that the security forces took out the enemies of the country with a display of bravery and professional capacity, adding that the nation was standing with its brave forces in the fight against terrorism.
“The terrorists want to sabotage the peace and stability in the country, which can never be allowed as the nation is united and the scourge of terrorism will be defeated at all costs,” he said.
The president also reiterated the resolve that the security forces would continue their operations till complete eradication of terrorism.
 






Similarly, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the nefarious designs of terrorists, who were inflicting harm upon the lives and properties of innocent civilians, would be foiled.
“The elements of Fitna al-Hindustan, who are enemies of the country’s solidarity, will be rooted out,” he said in a statement from the PM Office.
The prime minister further said that the government and security forces were committed to the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.
“Security forces, through timely action, thwarted the nefarious intentions of Indian-sponsored terrorists.
The nation views the operations of the security forces to eliminate India’s terrorist elements with appreciation.
“The exemplary end of Indian-sponsored terrorists is a clear message that there will be no place for this menace to hide in Pakistan. We will eliminate every single terrorist of the Indian menace from Pakistan,” he said.
 






The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
Furthermore, there has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Last week, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.
In April, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2217122936e05c7.png?r=171936' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925866/govt-says-punjab-assembly-opposition-leaders-10-year-sentence-in-may-9-riots-case-according-to-law' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says Punjab Assembly opposition leader’s 10-year sentence in May 9 riots case according to law</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday welcomed a Sargodha Anti-Terrorism Court’s (ATC) sentencing of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly (PA) Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to 10 years in prison over a case related to the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023, hailing it as a positive step.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan — who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
 
 

Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Today, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it … I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.”
He said the verdict “fulfils all requirements of justice” and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. “The decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,” Malik said.
The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.
“When you take the law into your own hand, whether you’re an MNA or MPA or opposition leader … the [status] doesn’t matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.”
Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.
Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were “carefully curated” via “planning” to precisely attack over 200 locations.
Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.
 






PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that “neither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.”
He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the “biased decision” in the high court.
 






Terming the decision “outright injustice”, the party’s South Punjab wing said, “The truth is that the establishment’s role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.
“These punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country’s democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!” the statement read.
 






PTI MNA and lawyer Shafqat Awan also condemned the decision. “I have never seen a more horrific and brutal decision than the one given by the Sargodha ATC judge,” he told reporters.
 






Punjab Assembly PTI MPAs restored
Today’s conviction follows a recent tussle between the PML-N’s Punjab government and the PTI, after PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan suspended 26 opposition MPAs and sought their disqualification for their “unparliamentary conduct”.
However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally rejected the disqualification petitions following negotiations between the government and the opposition.
A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p><small>2025-07-22 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2216565381fb3c0.png?r=175310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues Glof alert for GB, KP as over 200 stranded tourists rescued from Diamer amid floods</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing yesterday in Diamer’s Babusar area.
In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.
It forecast that the wet spell was likely to continue and could affect GB and KP in the current week, adding that scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, were expected in both regions.
 






The death toll in GB since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement: “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”
He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.
DC Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified. According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.
According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.
“One of the five bodies will be transported via helicopter later today,” he added.
 


Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.
A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by Dawn.com, said all travellers “should be stopped at both ends” of the road until further notice.
“All tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,” the notification read.
An emergency control room was also established that will operate “round the clock”. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.
Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told Dawn.com: “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”
Shahabuddin, a resident of Chilas, said the local people provided food and accommodation to some stranded tourists in Babusar’s Thak area of Babusar and were also assisting the rescue operation.
All doctors and paramedical staff of the Chilas District Headquarters Hospital were called on an emergency basis, according to a notification issued by medical superintendent Dr Abdul Mobin.
 


Outlining the damage caused by the floods in a statement, DC Kakar said that more than 100 houses had been fully damaged in GB in the recent torrential rains.
Faraq told Dawn.com: “In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.
Efforts underway to re-open Karakoram Highway
The process of removing debris and re-opening the Karakoram Highway (KKH) was underway by the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation, National Highway Authority and the GB administration, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“Several points from Thalichi to Chilas have been cleared. Similarly, traffic has been restored at Jaglot-Skardu road,” the report said.
It added that the process of road clearance was underway in Tatta Pani and Jalipur, while heavy machinery had been dispatched to reopen three points at Gandola Nullah.
“Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area,” Faraq said earlier today.
The GB government spokesperson shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the KKH, stranding tourists.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed authorities to provide every possible assistance and rehabilitation facilities to the flood-affected people across the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In their separate statements, they directed relevant departments to accelerate relief activities in the affected areas, as well as expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious lives due to rains.
 






‘Hundreds’ of stranded tourists rescued in Skardu
Skardu Rescue 1122, in its WhatsApp channel, said three people were injured due to the flood in the Sadpara village, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.
Ghulam Muhammad, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department, said in a statement: “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sadpara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”
According to the spokesperson, the stranded people were rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.
 
 

He said, “Heavy rain in Skardu triggered flash floods in Barge Nullah, Dhagyol Nullah and Shagri Bala Nullah on the outskirts of the city.”
“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” the official added.
NDMA issues landslide alert
According to an NDMA advisory, the following areas in the country’s north may potentially face landsliding: Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamer, Ghanche in GB; Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Bagh, Poonch in Azad Jammu and Kashmir; and Chitral, Dir, and Kohistan in KP.
In these areas, the following roads have been identified as prone to landsliding: Kohistan Road, Kolai Palas Road, Jaglot Road, Nagar Road, Hunza Road, Tatta Pani Road, Jaglot Skardu Road.
 






The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
In KP, the tourism department established a flood emergency response unit and appointed six focal persons for different areas of the province.
A notification issued by the department’s secretary Abdul Samad today, seen by Dawn.com, said that the unit was in the office of KP Culture and Tourism Authority with the helpline number 1422.
Two swept away in Rawalpindi’s DHA
Separately, rescue efforts were underway after a retired army officer and his daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by the rainwater drain in Rawalpindi, according to the police.
Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, “left his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle”, said a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” it added.
A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said. A car bumper was recovered later as the search went on.
A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.
 


Rain-related death toll rises to 234
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.
According to the NDMA’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 234 people across the country and injured 596. Of these, 13 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 135 deaths and 470 injuries. KP reported 56 fatalities, Sindh 24, Balochistan 16, two in Azad Kashmir and one death in Islamabad.

Over 61 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by house-collapse incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 826 houses and led to the deaths of 203 livestock.
A spokeswoman for the agency told AFP that the heavy rains usually start later in the monsoon season.
“Such death tolls are usually seen in August, but this year the impact has been markedly different,” she said.
 






PTA directs telecom operators to ensure uninterrupted services
Separately, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued an advisory to telecom operators, directing them to ensure uninterrupted services and maintain contingency plans for emergencies amid the ongoing floods.
A press release by the PTA said: “The advisory stresses the protection of telecom infrastructure in high-risk areas, availability of critical resources, immediate reporting of service disruptions, and dissemination of flood-related information to the public.”
“Operators have been advised to ensure the continuity of essential services, deploy trained teams, coordinate with local authorities, and efficiently address consumer complaints in affected regions.”
The PTA also activated its National Emergency Telecommunication Coordination Centre and established contact points at its headquarters and zonal offices for real-time coordination, the statement said.
The authority affirmed it was “closely monitoring the situation and will keep the public updated on service restoration efforts in flood-affected areas”.

The Fidic Asia-Pacific Awards honour excellence in consulting engineering across the region, spotlighting outstanding projects, emerging leaders, and industry strength, according to its website. Winners are announced at the Asia Pacific Infrastructure Conference in three categories: Powerhouse Awards, Outstanding Project Awards, and Emerging Leaders Awards.
The award to the Quetta International Airport Runway Reconstruction project was conferred at the Fidic Asia Pacific Conference 2025 held from July 15-17 in Islamabad, the PAA said on Sunday.
“This distinguished accolade recognises the successful delivery of Pakistan’s longest and structurally largest rigid runway, executed in sectional phases on an operational joint-user airfield,” the PAA statement said.
“Remarkably, the project was delivered with zero claims, zero safety incidents, and no closure of operations, setting a new benchmark in aviation infrastructure development.”
The award was jointly conferred upon the PAA and the project consultants in “recognition of their effective collaboration, technical expertise, and commitment to safety and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle”.
The upgraded runway was completed at an estimated cost of Rs5 billion, and received its first flight PK-3250 from Islamabad on May 31, 2023.
Further underscoring the project’s significance, Palomino Elvira, a FIDIC-accredited international mediator and advisor on global construction contracts, extended an invitation to the PAA to present the project as a case study at upcoming Fidic conferences in South Africa and France later this year, the PAA said.
This recognition marks a proud moment for Pakistan’s aviation and engineering sectors, placing PAA’s excellence on a global stage, the statement added.</p><small>2025-07-22 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615254-four-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-kalat-sanitisation-operationhistans-kalat-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian-backed terrorists killed in Kalat sanitisation operation</strong></a><br><p>

Until recently, this building on a pothole-ridden street in Lyari town was home to multiple families, playing a central role in the neighbourhood’s daily life. But decades of neglect and structural deterioration led to a tragic collapse earlier this month, resulting in the deaths of 27 people and injuries to several others, leaving dozens homeless. Most of the victims belonged to the Hindu community.
“It felt like a bomb exploded over my head. All I recall is being pulled out of the rubble by people, and there was a lot of screaming,” Rashid Ali, who miraculously survived a fall from the rooftop with a fractured right leg, told Anadolu.
Another resident, Chaman Meshuri, described two distinct jolts that shook the building moments before it collapsed, allowing some residents to escape.
“I was at my shop when my son called me about the jolts. I told my family to get out immediately,” Meshuri told Anadolu.
His quick response saved the lives of his five children, but four other family members who could not evacuate in time were killed.
Initial investigations revealed that the structure, originally built with only three floors, had been officially declared unsafe in 2022. Instead of evacuating, the building owner allegedly collaborated with local authorities to illegally add two additional floors, further weakening its already fragile foundation.
Residents, including Ali and Meshuri, say they were never informed about the evacuation order.
‘Ticking bombs’
Lyari contains hundreds of dilapidated buildings deemed unsafe for living. Additionally, Lyari has over 1,500 buildings from the British colonial era, many officially classified as protected sites.
Official statistics indicate that around 600 buildings across Karachi have been declared unsafe, with at least 50 in “extremely dangerous” conditions, threatening imminent collapse.
“These buildings are like ticking bombs that may explode any day,” Arif Hasan, a veteran city planner, told Anadolu.
Hasan attributed the city’s vulnerability to disasters to widespread corruption, persistent violations of construction laws and inadequate oversight by building authorities.
“One strong tremor can cause a massive disaster. There are so many poorly designed and made buildings across Karachi,” he warned. According to Hasan, many pre-partition structures are in relatively better shape than newer, poorly constructed buildings.
Many older buildings are either illegally occupied or house tenants who still pay nominal rents set during partition in 1947, ranging from Rs150-250. Neither tenants nor owners prioritise necessary maintenance, experts say, posing a grave risk to Karachi’s architectural heritage.
Mounting housing crisis
Building collapses are not unusual in Karachi.
In March 2020, another deteriorated building collapsed in Golimar, killing at least 27 people and injuring over 50.
However, the threat extends beyond older buildings, as even new constructions are prone to collapse due to poor regulatory oversight.
According to Hasan, Karachi’s growing housing shortage forces people into the hands of unregulated developers, exacerbating the crisis.
“The city desperately needs a strategy to provide affordable housing to the lower and middle-income population. It’s the only way to gradually resolve this problem, otherwise, people will keep falling prey to informal builders, and such disasters will continue to happen,” he emphasised.
Agreeing with this assessment, Hassan Bakhshi, chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers, offered the association’s assistance for reconstructing dangerous buildings.
“These buildings are a lurking danger, not just for their residents but all other nearby structures as well. They need to be pulled down immediately and reconstructed in line with seismic and other crucial guidelines,” said Bakhshi.
He noted that most occupants of these structures lack the financial means to reconstruct without government assistance. He recommended establishing an independent authority comprised of developers, engineers, town planners and officials to address the issue urgently.
The provincial government has directed the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) to immediately vacate and demolish buildings categorised as “highly dangerous”. An SBCA spokesperson confirmed evacuation notices have been issued to residents of about 50 dangerous buildings.
“Evacuation is not an easy task because residents resist any such step. They demand alternative housing, which is not in our domain,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
Acknowledging that authorities had violated construction regulations by allowing additional floors on the collapsed Lyari building, the spokesperson confirmed an ongoing investigation. Eight SBCA officials and the building’s owner have been arrested.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon recently acknowledged that the provincial government could not house all residents living in dilapidated buildings.
“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that to house the most deserving residents — those who have no other option,” Memon told reporters, adding that there was no legal obligation for the government to do so.</p><small>2025-07-22 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22165952dbda02b.jpg?r=170347' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925853/pakistani-saudi-naval-chiefs-discuss-regional-security-and-enhanced-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani, Saudi naval chiefs discuss regional security and enhanced defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistani and Saudi naval chiefs held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the regional maritime security situation and enhancing defence cooperation.
The two countries conducted a bilateral training drill involving their special forces with a high-intensity final test exercise in Karachi in February. The bilateral training exercise was held between the Special Operations Forces (SOFs) of Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) and Special Service Group of Pakistan Navy (SSG-N).
A statement issued today from the Pakistan Navy’s (PN) Director General Public Relations said RSNF Chief of the Naval Staff Vice Admiral Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Ghuraybi met Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad, on Tuesday.
The Saudi naval chief was received by Admiral Ashraf and presented with a guard of honour. He was also introduced to the principal staff officers.
“During meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, regional maritime security situation and avenues for enhanced cooperation in defence, training and security. Dignitaries appreciated successful conduct of PN-RSNF Ex Naseem Al Bahr-XV held at North Arabian Sea this year.”
 






Admiral Naveed Ashraf highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s initiatives for ensuring maritime security and regional stability through the Regional Maritime Security Patrols (RMSP) mechanism.
The Saudi naval chief appreciated and acknowledged the Pakistan Navy’s contributions and “unwavering commitment to collaborative maritime security efforts in the region”, the statement said.
 






It added that he “commended PN for the quality training being imparted to RSNF cadets at Pakistan Naval Academy and onboard PN Ships, acknowledging its profound impact on their professional development”.
The two naval chiefs pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of the existing bilateral defence relationship between the countries.
The statement said that the PN and RSNF enjoyed a “long-standing and brotherly relationship”, adding that the RSNF chief’s visit would further enhance bilateral defence collaboration between the two countries.</p><small>2025-07-22 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615244-punjab-assembly-acting-speaker-restores-26-suspended-opposition-lawmakers' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly acting speaker restores 26 suspended opposition lawmakers</strong></a><br><p>

The scheme dwarfs the mighty Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest, and Chinese construction and engineering stocks surged after Premier Li Qiang unveiled it on the weekend.
For Beijing, the project promises clean power, jobs and a jolt of stimulus for a slowing economy. For neighbours downstream, it stirs old anxieties about water security: the Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra in India and Bangladesh, a lifeline for millions.
What exactly did China approve?
The plan involves five dams along a 50-kilometre stretch where the river plunges 2,000 metres off the Tibetan Plateau.
First power is expected to be generated in the early-to-mid 2030s, but beyond that and the price tag, China has published little information about how it intends to build the project.
Why are neighbours concerned
That lack of information is compounding fears about water security in India and Bangladesh, which rely on the Brahmaputra for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.
The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China, said earlier this year that the dam could dry out 80 per cent of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas such as neighbouring Assam state.
 
 

In addition to water, the dam will also mean less sediment flowing downstream, according to Michael Steckler, a professor at Columbia University. That sediment carries nutrients essential for agriculture on floodplains downstream.
India and China fought a border war in this region in the 1960s, and the lack of transparency from Beijing has helped fuel speculation it might use the dam to cut off water in another conflict, according to Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.
“The construction of the Yarlung Zangbo hydropower project is a matter within the scope of Chinas sovereign affairs,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding the dam would provide clean energy and prevent flooding.
“China has also conducted necessary communication with downstream countries regarding hydrological information, flood control, and disaster mitigation cooperation related to the Yarlung Zangbo project,” the ministry said.
India’s foreign and water ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
Will it starve India of water?
But the impact of the dam on downstream flows has been overstated, in part because the bulk of the water that enters the Brahmaputra is from monsoon rainfall south of the Himalayas, and not from China, said Modak.
He added that China’s plans are for a “run of the river” hydropower project, which means the water will flow normally along the usual course of the Brahmaputra.
India itself has proposed two dams on the Siang river, its name for the Yarlung Zangbo. One, an 11.5-gigawatt project in Arunachal Pradesh, will be India’s largest if it goes ahead. Those have been proposed, in part, to assert India’s claims on the river and bolster its case should China ever seek to divert the water, Modak added.
“If India can show that it has been using the waters, then China cannot unilaterally divert,” he said.
Controversy is common
Quarrels over dams and water security are not new. Pakistan has accused India of weaponising shared water supplies in the disputed Kashmir region after New Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates water sharing between the neighbours.
In Egypt, a senior politician was once caught on camera proposing to bomb a controversial Nile river dam planned by Ethiopia during a long-running dispute over the project.
Earthquake and extreme weather risks
The dam will be built in an earthquake zone also prone to landslides, glacial-lake floods and storms. A spree of dam building in the area sparked concerns from experts about safety following a devastating earthquake in Tibet earlier this year.
A much smaller hydropower project on a nearby tributary has been limited to four-month construction windows because of engineering challenges in high altitudes and vicious winters.

Swat District Police Spokesperson Moin Fayaz said in a statement that the victim, Farhan, had missed classes for a few days before the incident occurred.
Police and eyewitnesses said that three teachers reportedly beat Farhan in front of fellow students.
“He had just returned to school after being absent for some days,” said one of Farhan’s classmates, who chose not to be named.
“Our teachers started hitting him hard. Later, they dragged him into a side room and kept beating him. I was called in to bring water. He drank a little, then put his head in my lap — and just went silent.”
Farhan was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival, according to Fayaz.
A first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, has been registered against all three suspects under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Section 37 (punishment for violence) of the Child Protection Act (CPA).
“One of the suspects has been taken into custody, while efforts are underway to arrest the other two.
“This is a deeply disturbing case. A thorough investigation is ongoing, and we are committed to ensuring justice for the child and his family,” Fayaz said.
Farhan’s uncle, Saddar Ayaz, told Dawn.com that when his nephew was at home, he was afraid to go back to the madressah and did not want to return.
“I took him to the seminary myself, handed him over to the teachers, and went back,” Ayaz said. “Later that evening, one of the teachers called me and told me that my nephew had fallen in the toilet and died.”
Human rights groups and local residents have demanded action — not just to punish those responsible, but to prevent future tragedies.
“Farhan could have been any of our children,” said Haider Ali, a local elder. “He went to study. He never came back.”
Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.

Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), 221 people have been killed and more than 500 others injured in rain-related incidents since June 26.
According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul, a woman and her two sons were attempting to cross a stream in the Sur Dherai area of Malam Jabba, when her children drowned.
“The mother, holding her 10-month-old baby in her arms, was trying to guide her seven-year-old son across the stream when a flash flood struck. In the chaos, she lost control, and the child in her arms was swept away,” Gul said.
The bodies of the two sons were recovered by rescue personnel after hours of coordinated effort, the official added.
In a separate incident in Gujar Band Shanko area of Madyan, a house collapsed due to heavy rainfall, claiming the lives of three children and seriously injuring a woman.
Upon receiving the emergency call, Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene and retrieved the victims from the rubble with assistance from local volunteers, the spokesperson said.
They were later taken to the Civil Hospital Madyan, where the injured woman was placed under critical care.
Authorities have issued advisories urging residents, particularly those living in mountainous or low-lying areas, to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing monsoon season.
The district administration said it was closely monitoring weather patterns and has mobilised emergency services to respond to any further incidents caused by the relentless rains.
In June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths in Swat while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
Damages as rain spell hits KP
A new spell of monsoon rains on Monday hit several parts of the province, damaging houses and crops and suspending traffic.
The high flood in Chitral River triggered by the fast melting of glaciers washed six houses and a large chunk of the farmlands of Junali Koch village near Booni town.
In Yarkhon Valley of Upper Chitral, heavy rains wreaked havoc in Arakhan village in Mirgram and severely damaged dozens of houses. According to residents of the affected villages, a large number of livestock were washed away by the flash floods.
Similarly, the Chitral River was flooded, leaving houses and infrastructure in Ayunand and other low-lying areas of Lower Chitral at risk of damage.
In Bajaur tribal district, authorities closed the Jar Bypass Road, which connects the district to the rest of the country via the main Bajaur-Munda Road, to traffic after heavy rains triggered flooding.
District authorities urged people to use Khar-Qazfi Bypass Road to avoid any potential incidents. Rescue 1122 stated that rescuers have been deployed to deal with any emergency eventuality.
The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on Darra Tang Road. Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between KP and Punjab were stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.</p><small>2025-07-22 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615230-telecom-companies-directed-to-ensure-uninterrupted-services-amid-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Telecom companies directed to ensure uninterrupted services amid heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>

In the fiscal year 2024, the US issued nearly 11 million non-immigrant visas according to the State Department. These encompass international students, many leisure and business travellers and other temporary visitors.
The new fee will apply to all visitors requiring non-immigrant visas to enter the US. This does not include tourists and business travellers from countries that are included in the Visa Waiver Programme — including Australia and many European countries — that do not need visas for stays of 90 days or less.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown PC law firm’s immigration attorney, Steven A. Brown, said in a post, “The intent behind this refund provision is to incentivise compliance with US immigration laws by treating the $250 as a refundable security deposit — essentially rewarding those who follow the rules.”
However, he added that the refund is not automatic and that “the burden will likely fall on the visa holder to prove compliance” in an as-yet-undefined refund application process.
“Until those procedures are announced, employers and foreign nationals should treat the $250 visa integrity fee as a non-refundable upfront cost and plan accordingly. If a refund becomes viable in the future, it may provide an added benefit — but for now, it remains a theoretical incentive awaiting implementation guidelines.”
In an email to CNN, Brown noted that the purpose of the fee was unclear, saying that in general, immigration fees were meant to cover adjudication or issuance expenses, but that theoretically, all visa integrity fees could be refunded in a “perfect world” with no overstays or violations.
No specific information has been provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the refund process or other aspects of the policy, including when it will be rolled out.
“The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN.
A State Department spokesperson said that details of the change, implemented by DHS, would be posted on the State Department’s visa information page.
The spokesperson said that the purpose of the fee was to “support the administration’s priorities of strengthening immigration enforcement, deterring visa overstays, and funding border security.”
The initial fee for the 2025 fiscal year has been outlined as either $250 or “such amount as the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish, by rule”, whichever amount is greater. The fee is subject to annual adjustments for inflation.
The bill provision added that fees that were not reimbursed would be “deposited into the general fund of the treasury”.
The US Travel Association, a nonprofit organisation, called the new visa fee “a giant leap backwards” despite praising other aspects of the domestic policy bill.
The senior vice president of government relations for the association, Erik Hansen, said in a statement that the fee “adds an unnecessary financial barrier for international visitors”.
The association calculated that the fee would boost the upfront costs of visiting the US by 144pc.
“Even if it is technically reimbursable, the added complexity and cost will discourage visitors,” Hansen said.
Meanwhile, the CEO of the association, Geoff Freeman, called the fee a “foolish” move that undercut otherwise smart investments in travel infrastructure and security, according to a statement on US Travel SmartBrief.
He argued that imposing new costs on travellers “undermines efforts to attract international visitors and support the US economy”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615220-car-swept-away-in-islamabad-after-heavy-rains-lash-twin-cities' target='_blank'><strong>Car swept away in Islamabad after heavy rains lash twin cities</strong></a><br><p>

For now, enrichment “is stopped because, yes, damages are serious and severe”, Araghchi told Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier”.
“But obviously we cannot give up enrichment because it is an achievement of our own scientists,” he continued, calling it a source of “national pride”.
He stressed that any future nuclear deal would have to contain the right to enrichment.
 


When asked whether any enriched uranium had been saved from the strikes, Araghchi said he had “no detailed information”, but that Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation is “trying to evaluate what has exactly happened to our nuclear material, to our enriched material”.
Washington bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran on June 22 to support Israel’s 12-day military offensive, including the Fordow underground uranium enrichment site located south of Tehran.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the strikes a success that “completely destroyed” the sites, lashing out at media reports citing intelligence findings of more conservative assessments.
Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. A US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”.
Araghchi, while saying there was no military solution to the dispute over Iran’s programme, told Fox News that “yes, facilities have been destroyed. They are severely destroyed”.
“But the technology is there, our nuclear programme, our enrichment programme, is not something imported from outside that can be destroyed by bombings,” he said.
Trump welcomed Araghchi’s comments in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday.
“Just like I said, and we will do it again, if necessary!” posted the US president.
Araghchi’s remarks come as Tehran is set to hold new talks on its nuclear programme with Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Friday in Istanbul.
Regarding negotiations with the United States to de-escalate regional tension, Araghchi said “we are open to talks” but “not direct for the time being”.
“We are ready to do any confidence-building measure needed to prove that Iran’s nuclear programme is peaceful” in exchange for lifted US sanctions, he added.
 
 

The foreign minister also confirmed that Iran would continue to develop and manufacture missiles.
Despite multiple barrages of missiles launched at Israel and waves of Israeli attacks on its bases and launchers, Araghchi said, “We still have a good number of missiles to defend ourselves”.
Baier also asked about the health of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rarely been seen since the start of Israel’s attack.
“I met him today, he is in a very good shape and in a very good health,” Araghchi said.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22110606b008037.png?r=110627' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925820/pakistan-signs-un-pact-to-conserve-marine-biodiversity-in-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs UN pact to conserve marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
In 2015, Pakistan’s seabed territory grew by about 50,000 square kilometres after a UN body accepted Islamabad’s claim for extension of sea limits.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the “Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction” (BBNJ Agreement) at the UN Headquarters in New York.
The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.
 






Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement “reflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”, the FO noted in a statement.
The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.
“Pakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,” the FO highlighted in a post on X.
“As chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.”
 






The FO statement recalled that Pakistan “consistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer”.
According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:

Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas
Environmental impact assessments
Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.

The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, lays down a “comprehensive regime of law and order for the world’s oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources”.
 
 

Within Pakistan’s territory, Churna Island was last year designated as the country’s second-ever marine protected area in a bid to preserve its unique but eroding biodiversity.
In 2020, experts found “amazing wildlife”, well-diversified bird fauna, rich marine habitat and dozens of species of corals at Astola Island in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-07-22 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22112155b6d5d8b.png?r=112215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925824/at-least-27-dead-mostly-children-in-bangladesh-air-force-jet-crash' target='_blank'><strong>At least 27 dead, mostly children, in Bangladesh air force jet crash</strong></a><br><p>At least 25 children were among the 27 dead pulled from scorched buildings after a Bangladesh Air Force jet on a training mission crashed into a college and school campus in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday, with 88 people being treated in hospital.
The F-7 BGI aircraft crashed soon after it took off at 1:06pm (12:06pm PKT) on Monday from the airbase in Kurmitola in the capital on a routine training mission. The military said the plane experienced a mechanical failure.
Visuals showed rescue workers scouring the charred buildings for debris as distressed family members surrounded the site.
Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser on health, told reporters that 27 people had died and 88 were admitted to hospital with burn injuries. Those dead included 25 children, a teacher and the pilot.
The government announced a day of mourning, with flags at half-mast and special prayers at all places of worship.
The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane’s Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
The incident comes as neighbour India is still grappling with the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade after an Air India plane crashed into a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad last month, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground.</p><small>2025-07-22 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/221143300fc2f84.png?r=114520' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925738/newcastle-legend-solano-set-to-become-pakistan-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Newcastle legend Solano set to become Pakistan head coach</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Nolberto Solano’s last managerial job might have not gone too well but the Newcastle United legend will look to turn a page on that when he takes over as the head coach of Pakistan’s senior and under-23 teams next month.
Solano is the first major appointment by the freshly-elected Pakistan Football Federation leadership with president Mohsen Gilani telling Dawn on Monday that he expected the former Peru winger to help the national team reach new heights.
“He will bring more zest and energy to the national team … especially in our style of play,” Mohsen added, noting Solano’s experience as the assistant coach of the Peruvian national team.
During his seven-year stint as assistant to Ricardo Gareca, Solano helped his country qualify for their first FIFA World Cup appearance in 36 years as Peru made it to the 2018 tournament in Russia.
 






Solano, who also helmed the under-23 side, stayed till 2022, leaving after Peru fell to Australia in an intercontinental playoff for the World Cup that year in Qatar.
Since then he’s had unimpressive spells with Swedish second-tier side AFC Eskilstuna and Blyth Spartans in England’s seventh tier. In the latter, he was sacked after just six games.
The Pakistan job offers Solano, who was nicknamed ‘Maestrito’ [Little Master] by Argentine icon Diego Maradona during his playing days, a chance to rebuild his coaching career and his immediate assignment would be taking charge of the under-23 team.
Pakistan are due to face hosts Cambodia, Iraq and Oman in Group ‘G’ in the qualifiers for the 2026 AFC Under-23 Asian Cup in September.
With the senior team, Solano will take over from Stephen Constantine and oversee the remainder of Pakistan’s 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying campaign, starting with a double-header against Afghanistan in October.
Constantine, who famously led Pakistan to their first-ever victory in a World Cup qualifier in October 2023, had been on a game-to-game basis with the team after his one-year contract ended in November last year. The Englishman has applied for the vacant head-coach job in India.

The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024, introduced by PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, seeks to amend Sections 292 to 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The bill has defined obscenity as per Article 37(g) of the Constitution, which states: “[The State shall:] prevent prostitution, gambling and taking of injurious drugs, printing, publication, circulation and display of obscene literature and advertisements”.
Under the proposed changes, Section 292 would increase the penalty for publishing, producing, exhibiting, distributing, or selling obscene material from a three-month sentence and an unspecified fine to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. A proviso clarifies the law does not apply to religious content or objects used for religious purposes.
Section 293 would raise the punishment for selling obscene material to individuals under 20 years from six months’ imprisonment or fine to two years and Rs100,000 in fines. Amendments to Section 294, which pertains to obscene acts and songs in public, would increase the penalty from three months to one year and introduce a Rs100,000 fine.

PTI leader wants parliamentary probe into sugar scandal, influence of sugar cartel in power corridors

The Senate also passed the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, moved by Senator Khalil Tahir. It raises the eligibility period for membership in provincial and Islamabad bar councils from five to ten years. Candidates must also have 15 years of advocacy experience and a minimum of 30 decided cases not involving government representation.
PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the timing, saying changes should take effect after upcoming bar elections. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar noted the election schedule would be issued in October and said the amendment had backing from all six bar councils.
Another key bill passed was the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals (Amendment) Bill, tabled by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla. It proposes establishing a commission to support journalists facing violence and threats. PTI supported the bill, with Barrister Zafar stating journalism had become one of the most dangerous professions in Pakistan.
The other bills passed by the House included “The State-Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024”, “The Abandoned Properties (Management) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The Islamabad Capital Ter­ritory Charities Registration, Regulation and Facilitation (Amendment) Bill, 2023”, and “The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024”.
Social media age restriction
Also, various other bills, including the one seeking to regulate social media access for individuals aged less than 16, were introduced in the House. The bill seeks to reduce the risks of underage people of cyberbullying, harmful content, and online exploitation, besides providing for young users’ privacy, and preventing commercial exploitation and data breaches.
While speaking on a motion on Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Zafar demanded immediate action against all those involved in the sugar scandal and called for submission of a comprehensive report by a parliamentary body to the Senate within 14 days.
 
 

“Let us not delude ourselves: this mafia is not operating from the shadows. It sits within the ranks of this very government. The beneficiaries of this scandal are not hidden; they sit in power, and the people know it,” he alleged.
He said citizens could no longer afford to survive. “Why is this burden being dumped upon the people in the name of the IMF? Why is there no transparency in the working of Ogra and Nepra? Why is there no accountability? The answer is simple but shameful: the sugar mafia controls the government and the government serves them,” the PTI leader said.
He sought formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the sugar scandal and the extent of the sugar mafia’s influence within the corridors of power.
Senator Danesh Kumar of BAP echoed the concerns, calling CCP ineffective against such cartels.
In response, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the CCP’s Cartels and Trade Abuse Department had completed 20 inquiries across key sectors, while the Office of Fair Trade had conducted 13 probes into deceptive practices. Since October 2023, the CCP’s Market Intelligence Unit uncovered 170 potential cases of anti-competitive behaviour in 28 sectors, including real estate, telecom, and banking.
Mr Aurangzeb urged the Senate Finance Committee to summon the CCP chairman and request a full progress report for the past two years. “For CCP to be effective, it must act proactively —not just reactively,” he admitted.

The horrific video of the incident went viral on Sunday, prompting a countrywide outcry. Baloc­histan Police chief Moa­zzam Jah Ansari told Dawn the woman’s family and her tribe members were allegedly involved in the murder as they killed her and her partner for allegedly having a relationship out of wedlock. The man who shot and killed the woman was her brother, the IGP said.
On Sunday, it was reported that the woman and the man had contracted a love marriage, and they were invited by their families on the pretext of a feast, where they were informed about the decision of the jirga.
Separately, a court ordered the police to exh­ume the bodies and conduct an autopsy, while an anti-­t­errorism court granted physical remand of Sardar Sher­baz Satak­zai to police for two days.
Balochistan High Cou­rt Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech also took notice of the double murder in Quetta’s Digari area, summoning the province’s top security officials.
 
 

According to a statement, the CJ summoned the additional chief secretary for home and the police chief to appear before the court on Tuesday.
‘Justice to be served’
In a press conference at the Chief Minister’s House, CM Sarfraz Bugti said over a dozen people, including tribal elder Sherbaz, had been arrested over the past 24 hours in connection with the incident. “Over a dozen suspects were present at the site of the killing, and police are conducting raids for more arrests,” CM Bugti said, adding that all those involved in this barbaric act would be brought to justice.
“We will make sure that all of them are prosecuted,” CM Bugti said at the presser. The chief minister claimed the man and woman were not married to each other, adding that the woman had five children and the man had four or five children from separate marriages. The CM said “a wrong impression” had been created in other parts of the country that they were killed on the order of a tribal jirga for getting married of their own choice.
“No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then film it on video,” he said, adding, “It is a crime and murder and the people involved in this act must be punished.”
The chief minister said the government had suspended the DSP of the Special Branch for not relaying information about the incident, which occurred three days before Eid. The victims’ families did not inform anyone about the incident, he said, adding that when police and law enforcement agencies went to the village to make arrests, the men fled while the women pelted the police with stones.
The CM said jirgas were part of the tribal society, but it was the job of the government to fulfil its responsibilities in such cases and discourage such decisions.

The men were convicted in 2015 of murder, conspiracy, and waging war against the country over the attacks during the evening rush hour of July 11, 2006 that also injured more than 800 people. Five were sentenced to death, while the other seven were given life imprisonment.
But, 10 years later, the Bombay High Court set aside a lower court’s verdict and acquitted the 12 men.
Justices Anil Kilor and Shyam Chandak said in their judgement, the prosecution had  “utterly failed to establish the offence beyond the reasonable doubt against the accused on each count”.
The men were ordered to be released from jail “if they are not required to be detained in any other case”. The prosecution can appeal against the order in the Supreme Court.
A total of seven blasts ripped through the trains after the bombs, packed into pressure cookers, were placed in bags and hidden under newspapers and umbrellas.
Prosecutors said the devices were assembled in Mumbai and deliberately placed in first-class coaches to target the city’s wealthy Gujarati community.
They said the bombings were intended as revenge for the riots in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, which left some 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.
Prosecutors accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being behind the attacks, although a little-known outfit called the Lashkar-e-Qahhar later claimed responsibility.

The proceedings, scheduled to continue until July 24, centre on a series of online allegations made by Mr Raja against the retired intelligence officer, which Brigadier Naseer claims are defamatory and untrue.
Mr Raja, who runs a YouTube channel and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, is accused of making multiple defamatory statements on social media, including allegations of corruption, electoral interference, judicial manipulation, and human rights abuse, all of which Brigadier Naseer strongly denies.
Brigadier Naseer appeared in person in the court, whereas Mr Raha appeared via video link. Mr Raja’s witness former accountability tsar Shehzad Akbar appeared in person, whereas Shaheen Sehbai and Syed Akbar Hussian appeared online from the US.
 
 

Naseer told the UK High Court that he and his family had faced threats to their lives, harassment, abuse, and serious breaches of privacy following online allegations made by Major (retd) Adil Farooq Raja.
Testifying on the opening day of the four-day trial in London, Brigadier Naseer described the personal and professional impact of nearly a dozen online publications made by Mr Raja.
He was cross-examined by Simon Harding, counsel for the defendant, while Mr Raja appeared remotely via Zoom. Among Mr Raja’s witnesses were former Assets Recovery Unit (ARU) head Shehzad Akbar, who attended in person, and journalist Shaheen Sehbai and Syed Akbar Hussain, who joined online from the United States.
Brigadier Naseer told the court: “False lies were spread about me, posing dangers to me and my family. My daughter had an offer from the King’s College London and so did my son from another UK university, but I was concerned after what Adil Raja did to me and decided to send them to the US for higher studies. I have family and friends in the UK, friends from the UK intelligence I have worked with. I was approached by all of them after the defendant started slandering me on social media.”
During cross-examination, Mr Harding pressed Brigadier Naseer on the issue of “serious harm” and asked why he had not produced evidence of the calls he claimed to have received from the UK in response to Mr Raja’s statements.
Mr Naseer responded that although the calls had occurred, he would not provide details to avoid exposing relatives and friends in the UK to what he said was further threats or online abuse.
He added that the harassment had escalated after Mr Raja allegedly published images of his son and family, leading him to change their academic plans. “One of the persons who attempted to assassinate me was a follower of Adil Raja,” he told the court.
“He was arrested and he confirmed he was inspired by Adil Raja’s publications about me and he wanted to kill me. One of the tweets wished death upon my son after his picture and the US university address were published.”
The trial began with the judge seeking clarity on the evidence supporting Mr Raja’s claims, including alleged interference in Pakistan’s 2024 general elections. The court is examining whether the statements qualify as factual claims, opinion, or potentially fake news, and whether they meet the UK legal standards for defences such as truth or public interest.
The case, filed in the King’s Bench Division of the UK High Court, began in August 2022. In 2024, the court ruled that nine out of ten statements made by Mr Raja were defamatory under English law. Mr Raja had attempted to have the case struck out, but this was rejected by the court.
 
 

In April this year, the court ordered Mr Raja to pay over £16,000 in security for costs and legal fees. An additional £6,100 was imposed in May for procedural delays. The trial will now proceed with both parties presenting their witnesses, some of whom will testify remotely.
In a recent pre-trial hearing, Mr Raja alleged that several of his witnesses were facing intimidation and harassment in Pakistan. The court acknowledged the concerns and granted certain protective measures, including permission for remote testimony from overseas locations.
Legal experts say the trial will hinge on whether Mr Raja can substantiate his claims with evidence and whether his statements fall under the UK’s defences of truth and public interest.
