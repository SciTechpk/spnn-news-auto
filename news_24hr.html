At least four people were killed and around 100 are unaccounted for — including 11 soldiers — after a wall of muddy water and debris tore down a narrow mountain valley, smashing into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state.
“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc, have been moved… to hasten the efforts”, the army said today.
Military helicopters were working to bring in “essential supplies, medicines and (for the) evacuation of the marooned”, it added.
Uttarakhand State Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain, and that rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.
Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-storey apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.
 


Several people could be seen running before being engulfed by the dark waves of debris that uprooted entire buildings.
Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency late on Tuesday that he had reports of “four deaths and around 100 people missing”.
‘Extreme event’
Torrential monsoon rains continue to pour down.
“Residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains”, the army added.
Government weather forecasters said on Wednesday that all major rivers in Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark.
Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.
A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with rescue officials estimating it was 15 metres deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.
Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Expert hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimetres of rain within 24 hours reported in the flood zone “counts as an extreme event”.
Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, said such rain in mountains has a “more concentrated” impact than on flatter lowlands.
“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common, and could be linked to climate change”, he said.</p><small>2025-08-06 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06111114d8e8c40.jpg?r=111125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928939/ttp-agrees-not-to-use-civilians-as-human-shield-in-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>TTP agrees not to use civilians as human shield in Tirah</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.
Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a pullout from Tirah to restore peace.
There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.
 
 

“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.

Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit

The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.
It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.
 
 

The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’
It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.
The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.
Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.
Both the incidents sparked widespread protests among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.
The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.
Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.
The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.

• Move seen as a response to China and Russia’s joint plans to build an automated nuclear station on the Moon by 2035
US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media.
It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface, reports BBC.
According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries “could potentially declare a keep-out zone” on the Moon.
But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon’s surface, with some planning permanent human settlements.
“To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,” US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times.
Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.
The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022, Nasa issued three $5 million contracts to companies to design a reactor.
And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.
Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.
One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging.
“Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,” suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the University of Surrey.
“Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,” he adds.
Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 “given the commitment of enough money”, and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors.
“It’s just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,” he adds, referring to Nasa’s Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon.

The hearing, scheduled for Aug 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents of the India-occupied territory.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked occupied Kashmir’s limited autonomy and brought it directly under federal control.
The move was accompanied by mass arrests and a communications blackout that ran for months as India bolstered its armed forces in the region to contain protests.
The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the India-occupied state’s special status, was challenged by political parties, the local bar association and individual litigants.
In Dec 2023, the Supreme Court upheld removing the occupied territory’s autonomy, but added that it be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”. “We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.

“In case of imposing a major penalty, the principle of natural justice requires that a regular inquiry should be conduc­ted and opportunity of defence as well as personal hearing should be provided to the civil servant,” Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abba­si observed in a six-page order he authored.
Justice Abbasi emphasised that in cases involving public funds, extra caution and due care is required to be obse­rved to prove the charge of embezzlement or misappropriation whereas proper inqu­iry needs to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure that the public funds, so misappropriated, could be retrieved and the civil servant involved in such offence, be punished accordingly.
He was a member of the Justice Musarrat Hilali-led bench that had taken up Malik Muhammad Ramzan’s appeal against the order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, Lahore, issued on Jan 24, 2022.
The controversy concerns the dismissal from service by the District Coordination Officer/District Collector Mianwali who proceeded against Malik Muhammad Ramzan under Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA) on the charges of fraud and embezzlement of funds. Malik Ramzan had allegedly raised the amounts of cheques through forgery after getting them signed by the relevant authorities.

Reinstatement of civil servant ordered, along with fresh inquiry

The petitioner filed departmental ap­­p­eal before departmental authorities, but the appeal was rejected on Nov 11, 2016. He filed a revision petition, which was also rejected on March 2, 2018 and against that order the petitioner preferred an ap­­peal before the tribunal. The tribunal, however, dismissed the plea on Jan 24, 2022. The petitioner finally approached the Su­­p­­reme Court against the tribunal’s order.
Loopholes
The apex court in its judgement held that the allegations of embezzlement/misappropriation of funds by altering the amount in cheques, which were neither authored nor signed by the petitioner, were required to be proved with conclusive evidence by confronting the petitioner with specific details.
However, Justice Aqeel observed, no such exercise appears to have been taken, nor the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner, were sent to any handwriting expert for verification.
The judgement noted that the Investi­gating Officer (IO) and the complainant before the anti-corruption department was the same person i.e. Ghulam Mustafa Sheikh, who was also the author and signatory of the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner.
It appeared that no departmental action was taken against him, therefore, the bias of the IO and the possibility of false implication of the petitioner in the instant matter could not be ruled out, the judgement said.
The Supreme Court regretted that caution and due care had not been taken in the present case and the respondent department failed to even place on record the enquiry proceedings, nor could refer to any concrete material or confidence inspiring evidence against the petitioner.
Moreover, the petitioner was not given any opportunity of being heard whereas, a major penalty of dismissal from service has been imposed upon the petitioner without conducting any regular inquiry.
The apex court held that the judgments passed by the tribunal and the orders of the lower fora were contrary to law and violative of the principles of natural justice as no regular inquiry had been conducted while imposing major penalty of dismissal from service.
Reinstatement ordered
While accepting the appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction to the respondents to reinstate the petitioner into service.
The case, however, was remanded back to the departmental authority to conduct de novo inquiry into the allegations levelled against the petitioner while providing him sufficient opportunity of being heard in terms of Sections 9 and 10 of the PEEDA.
The SC expected that such inquiry would be concluded preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of this order, the judgement said.

It was hoped it would eventually provide a framework for regional peace and development.
With Afghanistan becoming a member, this hope was further enhanced. However, after 40 years, Saarc has little to show for itself. The success of Asean provides a study in contrast. While it has contributed enormously to the strengthening of peace and development in Southeast Asia, Saarc has practically ceased to exist.
The reasons given include political tensions and bilateral conflicts, differing threat perceptions, institutional weaknesses, lack of political will, limited intra-regional trade, etc. The major reason, however, is that India has always been more interested in regional domination than regional cooperation.
In particular, the Indian demand that the issues of Kashmir and terrorism be resolved exclusively on the basis of its own demands has conveyed to the smaller countries of Saarc that if this is India’s attitude towards Pakistan, what chance will they have of getting a fair deal with regard to their own issues with India. As a result, Saarc has been unable to agree on a unified political agenda for peace and development.
India is much larger than all the other member states combined in area, population and size of economy. After its chastening experience of Operation Sindoor, one might have hoped India would now consider the possibilities for cooperation over hegemony.
The recent conflict also demonstrated that China has become a South Asian military, economic, political and strategic factor. This is a massive strategic development which seems to have stunned India into strategic paralysis. It is at a loss whether to continue the war or to cut its losses and embark on a course of regional cooperation and development, in which it could still be a leader if not a hegemon.

As long as India insists on regional hegemony, building peace and security will remain a pipe dream.

There have been other changes in South Asia. The change of government in Bangladesh; moves towards halting the deterioration in Pak-Afghan relations; the failure of the US to openly side with India against Pakistan; the failure of India to convince the international community that Pakistan was responsible for Pahalgam; and the international highlighting of the human rights situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
All this has compounded India’s regional predicament and domestic embarrassment, although the Modi government seems to be in no immediate danger.
The smaller countries of South Asia have always sought some sort of counterbalance to the overwhelming presence of India. The strategic entry of China into South Asia along with its globally attractive BRI, CPEC, and BRICS initiatives has confronted India with a strategic challenge. None of India’s alternatives to Saarc such as BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal) or Bimstec (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) have much attraction for the smaller countries of Saarc when compared with what China has to offer.
So, how can peace be built in South Asia? As long as India insists on regional hegemony, building peace and security will remain a pipe dream. Moreover, as long as India chooses to be a key player in the US Indo-Pacific Strategy of containing China, neither Pakistan nor any of the other smaller countries of Saarc will have much interest in seeing US global strategy prevail.
Nevertheless, Pakistan should not abandon efforts to improve relations with India. If they succeed, they will alleviate the concerns of the smaller Saarc countries that are not able to challenge India individually or collectively.
They will also reduce Indo-Pakistan tensions, which can progressively address the unending repression in occupied Kashmir. That can help revive Saarc as a credible regional organisation. It can also facilitate China’s vision for Asia as a region of shared prosperity instead of the US insistence on it being an accomplice in its quest for global hegemony.
Meanwhile, Pakistan will need to improve its global and regional image which depends on the quality of its democratic and economic governance including respect for the people’s demonstrated political preferences, the whole gamut of human rights, social justice, institutional credibility, space for dissent and protest, etc, far more than the prowess of its military on the battlefield or the astuteness of its diplomacy in the chancelleries of the world.
Unfortunately, Pakistan’s international ratings on good governance are among the worst in the world with all their implications and consequences.
Because an India normalisation policy is almost a non-starter today, Pakistan will need an effective ‘Rest of South Asia’ policy to present a credible alternative to Indian hegemony.
Pakistan must also disabuse itself of the illusion of balancing relations between the US and China. It should, of course, develop its bilateral relations with the US to the extent possible. But never at the risk of China suspecting the commitment of Pakistan to the fullest development of strategic relations with it. This risk is real because the US makes no secret of its strategy to contain the rise of China, and to assess its relations with China’s neighbours, especially Pakistan, according to the extent of their cooperation with this strategy.
After Operation Sindoor and Pakistan’s raised stature in the Muslim world and the Global South, there will be even less US tolerance for Pakistan maintaining any sort of ‘balance’ between the US and China.
Moreover, with the weakening of Iran, Trump and the US deep state as well as Israel will prioritise the prevention of Pakistan from becoming any kind of inspiration for resistance to Israeli and US genocide-based hegemony in the Muslim heartland.
Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence and its conventional military ‘fusion’ with China will become their policy focus.
In conclusion, for Pakistan to think it can sustain a strategic balance with the US and China is utterly unrealistic. Accordingly, the recent statement that ‘Pakistan-US ties must not be seen through China’s lens’ is very troubling, even if China has observed an eloquent public silence in response. The US will want to hold Pakistan to this unfortunate statement.

• Non-tax revenue up by 68pc
ISLAMABAD: The overall tax-to-GDP ratio increased by a record 3.2 percentage points in fiscal year 2025 to reach 15.7pc — the highest in over two decades.
The record earnings came on the back of heavy taxes imposed by the government to implement strict conditions outlined in the IMF loan programme and last-minute windfalls from non-tax revenue (NTRs).
During FY2024-25, the non-tax revenue grew by 68 per cent against a 26pc growth in tax revenues, indicating the government’s focus remained more on revenue numbers than tax reforms.
According to the fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance on Monday, the tax-to-GDP ratio has hit a 21-year peak of 15.7pc.
The previous high was 18pc in FY04. Since then, the ratio has been faltering between 10 to 15pc, except for 15.5pc and 15.2pc in FY17 and FY18, respectively and then again at 15pc in FY20 — all under IMF monitoring.
The growth of 3.2 percentage points in the overall tax-to-GDP last fiscal year was also the highest single-year increase. The previous record was 2.3pc in FY20 when the then government had imposed massive taxes as part of the IMF loan programme.
Record non-tax revenue
The non-tax revenue collection stood at Rs5.27tr for FY25. It amounted to 4.6pc of GDP, the highest in 16 years. Non-tax revenues include levies like the State Bank profit, markup collection from public sector entities, passport fee, oil and gas royalties, Gas Infrastructure Develop­ment Cess, Petroleum Development Levy, etc.
The non-tax revenue also surpassed the budget target of Rs4.84tr.
The ministry attributed the increase in revenues mainly to 68pc growth in non-tax collection as a consequence of higher collection of SBP profit and PDL.
The MOF had reported petroleum levy collection at Rs1.16tr in the 2026 budget.
However, updated data has now put the figure at Rs1.22tr, showing a windfall of about Rs60bn.
Another Rs108bn windfall came in the shape of markup collection from public sector entities. It was reported to be at Rs150bn in budget documents but finalised at Rs258bn. These windfalls reduced the fiscal deficit to a 9-year low of 5.4pc in FY25, about 1.4pc lower than 6.8pc of FY24.
The primary fiscal surplus — difference between total revenues and expenditures except interest payments — stood at 2.4pc of GDP or Rs6.17tr.
It was the highest since this new indicator was adopted for fiscal monitoring about a decade ago.
The Ministry of Finance had revised the FBR’s final revenue collection to Rs11.74tr against estimates of Rs11.9tr in the 2026 budget and the original target of Rs12.97tr.
This translated into a tax shortfall of Rs1.23tr, the country’s highest ever tax shortfall.
Total expenditure stood at 21.1pc of GDP (or Rs24.16tr), the highest since FY21.
Total federal mark-up payments and debt servicing for FY25 stood at Rs8.89tr, of which Rs7.98tr was for domestic debt servicing and Rs890bn for external debt servicing.
The total primary current expenditures for FY25 were recorded at Rs12.64tr, of which the federal portion amounted to Rs6.81tr, while provincial governments accounted for Rs5.83tr.
In FY25, total development and net lending expenditures was Rs2.97tr, including Rs786bn for the federal PSDP, including Rs2.12tr for provincial development.
The total statistical discrepancies were reported at negative Rs329bn, comprising Rs193bn from the federal government and Rs136bn from the provinces.

The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on Aug 14 formally.
The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also discussed the New Electric Vehicle Adoption Levy (NEVAL). The levy is expected to generate Rs122bn, which will not only fund the subsidy scheme but also meet a key condition of the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who presided over the meeting remotely, was informed that a Rs9bn subsidy had already been earmarked for electric vehicles in the current year’s budget. To fund the scheme, the government imposed a 1pc NEVAL on local and imported vehicles up to 1300cc, 2pc on vehicles between 1,300cc and 1,800cc, and 3pc on vehicles above 1,800cc.

ECC approves Rs100bn subsidy scheme for electric bikes, rickshaws

The first phase of the subsidy will involve the distribution of 40,000 e-bikes and 1,000 e-rickshaws/loaders. The scheme will be implemented across the country, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, with 219 e-bikes reserved for outstanding students. The second phase will roll out the remaining 76,000 e-bikes and 2,170 e-rickshaws/loaders.
The ECC highlighted that the adoption of electric vehicles was crucial not only for environmental reasons but also for reducing the country’s oil import bill and utilising excess power for productive purposes. The government’s New Electric Vehicle Policy aims to raise the number of electric vehicles to 30pc of all new vehicle sales by 2030, aligning with Pakistan’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.
One of the main barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles is the higher upfront cost compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. To address this, the subsidy scheme will focus primarily on electric two and three-wheelers, to be implemented over the next five years.
The financing options will include both conventional and Islamic loans, with a maximum loan size of Rs200,000 for e-bikes and Rs880,000 for e-rickshaws/loaders. The markup rate will be set at six months KIBOR plus 2.75pc, with loan tenures of two years for e-bikes and three years for e-rickshaws/loaders.
The government will provide a 20pc portfolio guarantee on a first-loss basis, while the debt-to-equity ratio will be 80:20. The government will contribute a maximum of Rs50,000 for an e-bike and Rs200,000 for an e-rickshaw/loader. Additionally, the government will cover the full cost of the markup, effectively making the loans interest-free for borrowers.
 
 

To be eligible for the subsidy, applicants must be between 18 and 65 years old for e-bikes and 21 to 65 years old for e-rickshaws/loaders. The quota for rickshaws/loaders will be allocated based on provincial population, with 10pc reserved for Balochistan.
A minimum of 25pc of e-bike quotas will be reserved for women, and 10pc will be set aside for individuals using e-bikes for commercial purposes, such as delivery services. For e-rickshaws/loaders, priority will be given to individuals, with any remaining quota allocated to fleet operators, capped at 30pc.
Applications for the scheme will be processed through a digital platform, allowing for transparent tracking and selection. If demand exceeds the provincial or segment quota, applicants will be selected through an electronic balloting system. Only shortlisted manufacturers and assemblers, approved by the Engineering Development Board (EDB) based on technical capacity and financial strength, will be eligible to participate.
In addition to the electric vehicle scheme, the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs30bn, requested by the Finance Division, to settle outstanding claims from the previous fiscal year under the Telegraphic Transfer Charges Incentive Scheme. The Finance Division was also instructed to conduct a detailed assessment of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative, with recommendations due by mid-September.

The military’s robust response to India’s aggression in May this year again proved its prowess.
Indeed, a strong military makes a country safer against external aggression. Yet, this is not enough to provide complete security to a nation whose economy is in a perpetual state of crisis and where close to 45 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line by some estimates.
According to the latest UN report, Pakistan currently ranks 168th out of 193 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI). (The only other South Asian country even lower in the human development category is Afghanistan.)
More than 23 million children are out of school. It’s a scary place for a country that has the highest population growth rate in the region. Some 80m people are added to the population each year, making it an explosive situation.
Growing inequalities between rich and poor, and among regions, have weakened the country, presenting the biggest challenge to national security — more than any external threat. As said by economists Acemoglu and Robinson in their seminal book Why Nations Fail, “extractive institutions”, intended to benefit a small elite, result in stagnation and perhaps even state failure.
They further argue that a nation’s long-term success hinges on “inclusive political and economic institutions”, which encourage broader participation. That concept should be seen in the context of Pakistan with its failing institutions and elite capture. In order to prevent state failure, we need to change our perception of national security and go beyond our traditional approach to defence; we must look at a broader range of threats and vulnerabilities, including economic, social and environmental factors. But the question is: are we willing to shift priorities?

Kinetic operations being carried out for over two decades have failed to eradicate militancy.

Pakistan is facing its most serious internal security challenges, with two strategically located provinces in the midst of an insurgency and the state losing its writ over a large part of these regions. Over the last two decades, Pakistani security forces have been fighting the insurgents with little success. The state has been relying almost exclusively on kinetic operations, without addressing the root cause of public discontent that is fuelling the insurgency.
Successive military and civilian leaders have failed to see the interconnection between insurgency and social and economic backwardness. Not only are the troubled regions deprived of health, education and employment facilities, they don’t even have political rights. The relentless use of kinetic force has further alienated the population.
Analysts working on forthcoming research linked to the topic have pointed out that among the most vulnerable districts are two former Fata districts and Kohistan in KP, plus 17 districts in Balochistan, including the most vulnerable districts of Washuk, Khuzdar, Kohlu and Zhob. Not surprisingly, they are centres of the ongoing insurgencies.
Regional inequalities appear starker when we learn that among the 20 least vulnerable districts, 13 are from Punjab, four from Sindh, two from KP — and not a single one from Balochistan. An overview of the facts sheds more light on the unequal distribution of resources: Punjab, the bastion of power, takes the lion’s share; Balochistan and the newly merged districts in KP get just a trickle.
The growing regional inequalities and vulnerabilities are reflected in the lack of communication and transportation facilities in Balochistan — the country’s largest province in terms of area. A number of contiguous district populations are deprived of easy access to roads, transport facilities, even telephones. It’s a different case in Punjab, where there is much better access to these facilities, especially in the northern and central areas.
Moreover, both KP and Balochistan have far lower accessibility to health facilities and community health services. Then there is also greater internal disparity between the districts within the province. In the most vulnerable districts, the distance to the nearest health facility can be more than 30 kilometres.
Such districts in KP and Balochistan have the highest unemployment rates and proportions of people working as unpaid family helpers. This is another indicator of fragile livelihoods.
The researchers estimate that more than 65pc of the population in Balochistan’s vulnerable districts inhabit temporary or makeshift homes; 50pc do not even have toilet facilities; and 40pc must do without proper water facilities. Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the youth in large numbers are easy recruits for militant groups in the province.
 
 

What seems to have worsened the situation in the vulnerable districts is the complete denial of even basic democratic and human rights to the people, which explains why kinetic operations being carried out for more than two decades have failed to eradicate militancy.
Surely, this also provides a favourable environment for external forces to intrude, especially with an alienated population that has no stakes in the existing system. The entire state narrative is about the foreign hand; there is no mention of the plight of the people who cannot access even basic facilities.
Unfortunately, the state has never prioritised the development of human infrastructure in the country, as reflected in its abysmal HDI ranking. Spending in the education and health sectors is not even 1pc of GDP — below even that spent by regional countries, barring perhaps Afghanistan. With its numbers growing at 2.5pc annually, the population is projected to reach 320m by 2040. It is a nightmarish scenario, with sluggish economic growth and little investment in health and education. We are sitting on a ticking time bomb.
Nothing could be more dangerous for national security. Particularly with increasing numbers of people falling below the poverty line. But there seems to be no realisation on the part of our rulers that the country badly needs to reset its priorities. We must rethink our national security paradigm before it is too late. Being a nuclear power cannot save us from implosion.

Despite persistent efforts — big and small, peaceful and chaotic — the party has remained unable to secure the release of its founder.
Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s reluctance to engage in dialogue has only deepened his isolation. It is unclear how much longer the PTI can sustain its resistance, or how far its leader is willing to go.
So far, pressure and disappointment do not appear to have broken him. But with the party’s organisational capacity severely diminished, questions remain about how long its stand-off with the state can continue.
Aug 5 was supposed to mark a symbolic turning point: two years since Mr Khan’s arrest.
The party, whose ’final call’ to secure their leader’s release last November had ended in blood and tears, had been instructed to re-mobilise and demonstrate its vigour. From initial reports, it appears to have fallen rather short of its goals.
Will this lead to a reassessment within party ranks, or perhaps even by Mr Khan himself? It remains to be seen.
What is clear is that the state has responded to each attempt by PTI workers to mobilise with firm resistance and is likely to continue to do so in the future. The intent appears to be to discourage any agitation by repeatedly demonstrating the latter’s futility. However, its heavy-handedness has not won the state greater legitimacy or public favour.
On the contrary, each crackdown has further alienated segments of the public and accelerated the erosion of trust in institutions. Those in power are surely aware of this, but there is a certain resignation to the status quo that nobody, especially not the civilian leadership, wishes to challenge. This is why Pakistan seems to be going nowhere; there is no end to the crisis in sight, and this is how things may continue.
The PTI has certainly been subjected to extraordinary pressure, and many of the actions taken against its leadership appear deeply troubling. Any political party would feel compelled to assert its rights in the face of such repression.
 
 

Yet, the PTI also ought to have realised that every failed attempt to challenge the regime would only embolden the latter further. The announcement of yet another round of protests last month invited disbelief because the party never seemed to have the strength or the strategy to mount a credible challenge. The PTI has long suffered from a lack of internal cohesion and organisation, and it, therefore, seemed fanciful of its leader to trust it with launching a forceful nationwide movement when it has never been weaker.
The attempt now seems to have faltered, and Pakistan remains just as mired in political stagnation. Without any leverage, the PTI could soon face tough choices.

Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad’s Sector G-6/1.
The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an absconder in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.
Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to “return to serious dialogue and a dignified solution”.
In a post on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the freezing of the company’s bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town’s operations across the country.

“The situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.
“Trillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,” he claimed.
 






Court proceedings
Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.
He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.
However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town’s chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the £190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.
Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.
Bahria Town’s legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the £190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.
With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.
Auction tomorrow
After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.
According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.
In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town’s Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.
The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.

The National Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) has issued a hydrological alert for flooding in the Sutlej river due to increased water discharge after rainfall in catchment areas.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) has issued an alert for flooding in Chen­­ab, Sutlej, Ravi and adjacent rivers from Aug 5 to 8.
The National Emergen­cies Ope­ra­tion Centre (NEOC) of NDMA has said monsoon currents are “actively penetrating” upper and central parts of Pakistan, and a “westerly trough persists over the northern areas”.
On Thursday, the discharge of water in the Sutlej river downstream of Ferozepur (Ganda Singh Wala) increased sharply from 28,657 to 33,653 cusecs within an hour.
While this intake is normal, the water flow is anticipated to increase due to heavy rainfall over Sutlej and Beas catchments in Uttarakhand, Hi­­machal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions of India and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
India is also releasing water from the Pong Dam built on the Beas river in Himachal Pradesh. The Bhakra Dam — on Sutlej river in Himachal Pradesh— and Pong Dam are currently at 55 per cent and 56 per cent storage capacity, respectively.
According to Indian media, the water level in the reservoirs is increasing and may lead to additional releases in the coming days.
This could lead to a low-level flood in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala during the current week.
Urban flooding
The Pakistan Meteorological Dep­artment (PMD) has also warned that moderate and intermittent rainfall is expected to increase river levels to low-flood conditions.
According to the PMD’s flood bulletins, the Indus river is currently in a low-flood state at Tarbela, Guddu and Sukkur, while other major rivers have normal flow levels.
The nullahs (streams) of the Ravi river may reach low to medium flood levels in the next 36 hours, the PMD said, warning of possible urban flooding in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore and Islamabad over the next two days.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia emphasised the need for all relevant departments, including local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, and transport, to stay on high alert.
Fresh rainfall
The PMD stated that due to heavy rainfall on Aug 6, an increase in water flow is expected in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shan­gla, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbott­ab­­ad, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy falls may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Peshawar and Nowshera in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, landslides and mudslides are expected in vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, Murree and Galiyat.
The sixth spell of monsoon rains is expected to persist until Aug 7, with gradual weakening thereafter, the Met Department said.

• KP meeting discusses implementation of repatriation plan
PESHAWAR: The federal government has informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on Sept 1.
The decision follows the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated Aug 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“It has been decided that the voluntary return of PoR cardholders shall commence forthwith, while the formal repatriation and deportation process will take effect from Sept 1, 2025,” the letter said.
Besides, the ministry said that repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, including Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, would continue as per the earlier decision under the IFRP.
 
 

In the letter, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON were instructed to provide databases of PoR cardholders to provincial, divisional and district committees. The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) will facilitate the deregistration of returning Afghans at transit areas and border terminals, with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) supporting repatriation at designated border crossings.
The ministry also directed provincial governments and relevant agencies to map all PoR cardholders and devise action plans for repatriation. It called for designated transit areas for deportees, along with transportation and financial arrangements.
IFRP’s implementation
Meanwhile, a meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Steering Committee (PSC) took place on Monday to discuss the IFRP’s implementation. Acco­rding to the minutes, the committee directed district administrations, police and Special Branch to form teams and hold jirgas with Afghan elders to encourage voluntary repatriation. Additi­onally, deputy commissioners across the provinces were tasked with remapping PoR cardholders.
The PSC decided that Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) should reestablish the Peshawar and Landi Kotal transit points to full operational capacity.
The forum also recommended that the Commissionerate of Afghan Refugees de-notify the refugee camps, as they no longer serve any purpose. It requested the Commissionerate to provide details on registration categories and the number of individuals still residing in the camps.
Regarding local transit points for deportation, the PSC clarified that the relevant deputy commissioner, with military authorities’ advice and Nadra’s guidance, should decide the fate of local deportees. The meeting stressed that these points would only be used for local deportees, with Torkham remaining the primary exit point.
Official sources told Dawn that Pakistani authorities had informed their Afghan counterparts earlier in March this year that PoR cards would not be extended beyond June 30, 2025.
 
 

According to the UNHCR, over 1.3 million Afghans were living in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. Of this, over half (717,945) were in KP, while 326,584 resided in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh, and 43,154 in Islamabad.
In 2004-05, the Pakistani government, with assistance from the UNHCR, issued PoR cards to Afghan refugees, and in 2016, Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC) were introduced through an amendment to the Foreigners Act 1946.
UNHCR voices concern
Meanwhile, UNHCR, in a statement, expressed concern over Pakistan’s intention to forcibly return Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. “Over the past days, UNHCR has received reports of arrests and detention of Afghans across the country, including PoR cardholders,” it said.
The UN agency said it acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s generosity in hosting refugees for over 40 years amid its own challenges. However, given that those holding PoR cards have been recognised as refugees for decades, their forced return is contrary to Pakistan’s long-standing humanitarian approach to this group and would constitute a violation of the principle of non-refoulement.

• Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can’t be settled through amendments to local laws
KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.
He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad’s D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally changed the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash­mir, and Ladakh.
The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.
In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.
The Hindustan Times reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region’s statehood.
The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was “a promise that the government has already made… and it will be done when the time is right”.
However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.
Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: “I’ve heard every possible permutation & combination about what to expect in J&K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow — fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.”
 






Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.
‘Subservient govt’
In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India’s attempt to “usurp Kashmir”.
“India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,” he said, adding that the move was further consolidated by the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which gave “stamp of approval” to the con­troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can’t be settled through amendments in local laws.
In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region’s legislative assembly changed to “influence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir”.
He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.
“All these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.” “This is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,” the foreign minister warned.

An exceptionally-large group of the UN-mandated experts voiced grave concerns over the GHF’s operations.
The private organisation began distributing food in Gaza Strip in May as Israel began easing a more than two-month aid blockade on the Palestinian territory that had exacerbated existing shortages.
 
 

“The GHF … is an utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law,” the experts said in a joint statement.

Allege Israel is exploiting aid for covert military and geopolitical agendas

“The entanglement of Israeli intelligence, US contractors and ambiguous non-governmental entities underlines the urgent need for robust international oversight and action under UN auspices. Calling it ‘humanitarian’ adds on to Israel’s humanitarian camouflage and is an insult to the humanitarian enterprise and standards.”
On July 22, the UN rights office said Israeli forces had kil­led more than 1,000 Palesti­nians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations — nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites.
“Without clear accountability, the very idea of humanitarian rel­ief may ultimately become a casualty of modern hybrid warfare,” the special rapporteurs said.
“The credibility and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance must be restored by dismantling the GHF, holding it and its executives accountable, and allowing ex­­perienced and humanitarian actors from the UN and civil society alike to take back the reins of managing and distributing lifesaving aid.”
The joint statement was signed by Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.
The statement was also signed by 18 other special rapporteurs, plus other UN experts and members of UN working groups — a notably large number for such statements.
Special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to report their findings. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.

Sources said his three-day trip to Islamabad as part of the renewed effort to reset relationship between the two countries had to be delayed due to UN Security Council sanctions and travel ban.
He is one of the senior Taliban figures on the sanctioned list but had been granted waiver to travel. He has led high-level diplomatic delegations to Moscow and Beijing, but this is the first time that the Afghan Taliban foreign minister has been disallowed to travel abroad.
 
 

Other senior Taliban figures too have been barred from tra­velling abroad. Analysts say this is the first time that the foreign minister was denied permission, apparently, to exert pressure on the regime on a host of issues of concern to the international community.
Sources said that Islamabad was working to get permission from the UNSC to facilitate Mr Muttaqi’s visit. Pakistani officials had cited “technical reasons” for the last-minute change, but sources said that the real reason was the UNSC travel ban.
A Foreign Office spokespe­r­son told Dawn both sides were still in the process of wo­rking on finalising dates. “There is no question of delay or cancellation.”

• Speaker cautions Sheikh Waqqas over continued absence
• Talal insists no new military offensive in Bajaur
ISLAMABAD: Treasury members in the National Assembly relentlessly taun­ted and criticised the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday over its “failed protest call”, while renewing their offer for talks on national issues.
The dialogue offer was extended by government ministers and Speaker Ayaz Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue, as the nation observed Kashmir Exploitation Day to mark the anniversary of India’s controversial Aug 5, 2019, amendment, which altered the disputed status of the region.
In response, PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
Pressure mounted on PTI, already weakened by the disqualification of several of its lawmakers by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their convictions in the May 9 rioting cases, when the speaker issued a warning to PTI’s vocal MNA from Jhang and the party’s information secretary, Sheikh Waqqas Akram.
Mr Akram was cautioned that his seat could be vacated for being absent from the House for 40 consecutive sittings without prior notice.
PTI’s Chief Whip Aamir Dogar protested the speaker’s warning, claiming that Mr Akram had regularly submitted leave applications.
Achakzai slams PPP
The most hard-hitting speech came from Mehmood Khan Achakzai, chief of the Pashtoonkhwa Mili Awami Party (PkMAP), who declared Imran Khan as the “greatest leader” and criticised the speaker for not taking a stand to defend the members of the House.
Mr Achakzai said that the opposition had no enmity with the armed forces, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif or PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, stressing that they should all apologise for their past roles, move forward after pardoning each other and start new politics.
The PkMAP chief specially targeted the Pakistan Peoples Party, stating that he felt sorrow after seeing the PPP supporting the government in “violating” the Constitution.
Responding to Mr Achakzai’s speech, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq stressed the need for political dialogue among all parties, reiterating that both the prime minister and government ministers had already offered talks. “We will have to sit together if we want to resolve Pakistan’s issues. You all will have to do negotiations,” he said.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also called for meaningful dialogue between all political forces to address the country’s national challenges. He stressed that differences should be resolved through consensus, not confrontation.
Sardar Latif Khosa, another firebrand PTI MNA, termed it a welcome offer, but said it had come after wrongfully denying reserved seats to the opposition.
‘No new military operation’
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Int­e­rior Talal Chaudhry clarified that no new military offensive was being launched in Bajaur or any other region. However, he insisted that both armed and non-armed components of the National Action Plan (NAP) were still in effect.
He emphasised that political backing for security forces was crucial in combating terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
The minister expressed satisfaction over the recent cooperation with Iran, following the visit of the Iranian president.“

• Asks federal, provincial govts to maintain reform momentum
• New Urdu tax forms expected to benefit over 80pc of filers
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to ensure the full implementation of reforms by removing bureaucratic hurdles and institutional barriers.
Chairing a weekly review meeting on proposed reforms within the FBR, PM Shehbaz also expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio, which rose from 8.83 per cent in FY24 to 10.24pc in FY25, its highest level in 23 years. He attributed the improvement to the implementation of structural reforms in the tax machinery.
An official announcement said the premier reaffirmed that he, along with the federal government, will fully support and safeguard the reform initiatives undertaken by the relevant authorities.
The premier was informed that the FBR has achieved its tax collection target for the first month (July 2025) of the current fiscal year and is expected to achieve its targets in the coming months as well.
Officials also briefed the meeting on the updated income tax return form, now available online in Urdu via the FBR website. The new form is designed to be more user-friendly and accessible, which is expected to benefit approximately 84pc of return filers.
According to the announcement, PM Shehbaz also stressed the need for uniform and effective enforcement of “revolutionary” customs clearance reforms across the country.
 
 

The prime minister emphasised that integrating technology into the customs clearance reform agenda should substantially reduce procedural delays and improve institutional efficiency.
He urged both federal and provincial governments to maintain close coordination and adopt a unified strategy to preserve the momentum in tax collection achieved through FBR-led reforms in the upcoming fiscal year. He noted that the effective enforcement of existing tax measures would be critical to further boosting revenue.
The premier directed the formulation of a comprehensive strategy — developed in consultation with the FBR, relevant federal agencies and provincial authorities — to continue improving the tax-to-GDP ratio. He reaffirmed the approved timeline for FBR’s tax collection targets and reform milestones will remain unchanged.
The PM underscored the need to strengthen the institutional capacity of both FBR and the customs clearance system. He instructed the information ministry to raise public awareness about the reform agenda and its long-term benefits.
The meeting was informed that digital enforcement stations for customs clearance are being prioritised nationwide. The complete implementation of the Centralised Assessment Unit and faceless customs system is expected to significantly enhance efficiency and transparency.

He also said a “zero tariff” offer for imports of US goods into India was not good enough, alleging that India was “fuelling the war” in Ukraine.
Trump’s threat to India over its purchases of Russian oil started on July 31, when he announced a 25pc tariff for Indian goods, along with an unspecified penalty.
“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.
“Now, I will say this, India went from the highest tariffs ever. They will give us zero tariffs, and they’re going to let us go in. But that’s not good enough, because of what they’re doing with oil, not good.”
An Indian government source said that India’s purchases of Russian oil have helped to stabilise global oil prices by easing the pressure on supplies from other regions.
India, which is the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, buys more than a third of the oil it needs from Russia.
India hits back, markets slide
Meanwhile, in a show of political unity, India’s ruling party and main opposition condemned the US president’s threat.
Manish Tewari, a member of parliament and leader of the opposition Congress, said Trump’s “disparaging remarks hurt the dignity and self-respect of Indians”.
“The time has come to call out this constant bullying and hectoring,” he added.
BJP Vice President Baijayant Jay Panda quoted Henry Kissinger – the most powerful US diplomat of the Cold War era – in a post on X: “To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.”
 






India’s Foreign Ministry said the country was being unfairly singled out over its purchases of Russian oil, and highlighted continued trade between Moscow and both the United States and the European Union, despite the war in Ukraine.
“It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” it said in a statement issued late on Monday.
It also accused the United States and the European Union of a double standard, saying it is being unfairly singled out by them over its Russian oil purchases when they both trade extensively with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine.
But the Indian rupee, which was expected to drop to an all-time low against the dollar, was rescued by a likely intervention from the Reserve Bank of India.
The rupee closed at 87.8000 to the US dollar, down 0.2pc from Monday’s close of 87.6550. The currency fell to a low of 87.8850 on Tuesday, just shy of an all-time low of 87.95 hit in February. The Reserve Bank of India helped absorb some tariff-related pressure on the rupee through interventions conducted by state-run banks, a trader at a state-owned lender said.

• Barrister Ali Zafar slams ‘disqualification spree’, says decision ignores ‘final judicial determination’
• Commission reverses Muzaffargarh by-poll order after LHC ruling
ISLAMABAD: Following their conviction by an anti-terrorism court in May 9 cases, the Election Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday disqualified nine lawmakers, including opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate.
This latest move, described by a PTI leader as a ‘disqualification spree’ by the commission, takes the number of lawmakers ousted in less than two weeks to over a dozen.
Those sent home on Tuesday included NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, Senate Opposition leader Shibli Faraz, MNAs Zartaj Gul, Rai Haider Ali Khan, and Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza — a key PTI ally — was also disqualified, besides three Punjab MPAs Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, Junaid Afzal Sahi, and Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal.
One-third of the nine lawmakers disqua­lified by the ECP hail from Faisalabad.
A notification issued by the commission confirmed their disqualification and declared their seats vacant, on which by-elections will likely be held.
Last week, an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 individuals to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots sparked by the arrest of Imran Khan in a corruption case.
On the other hand, PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar slammed what he called a ‘disqualification spree’ and said the recent wave of “illegal moves” targeting specific PTI lawmakers was without any procedural consistency or final judicial determination.
“This raises the spectre of selective accountability and institutional overreach by the ECP, whose constitutional role is to be an impartial arbiter in electoral matters — not a substitute trial or appellate court,” he said, claiming such actions were “politically motivated and legally unsustainable”.
He was of the opinion that the ECP had violated due process and fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. According to Senator Zafar, disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) takes place if a person has been convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to more than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since release.
“Clearly, the conviction must be final and not sub judice. A mere trial court conviction does not attain finality if an appeal is pending before a higher court,” he said. He recalled that the Supreme Court in the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif v. ECP case (2018) held that disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) required that the conviction must have attained finality.
“Unless a conviction is upheld by the highest appellate forum, the ECP cannot assume the disqualification has materialised. In addition, Article 10A guarantees fair trial — the essential ingredient of which is that a person retains the presumption of innocence until all remedies are exhausted.”
If the ECP begins to disqualify persons based on non-final convictions or FIRs/investigations, it amounts to pre-judging guilt, which is unconstitutional, he said, adding that the election watchdog had no original jurisdiction to determine disqualification. He said the ECP was an administrative/quasi-judicial body under Article 218(3) and relevant statutes and could act only after a final conviction or declaration was passed by a competent court.
Barrister Zafar said the “use of ECP to target politicians before their legal process was complete undermines the democratic order and judicial independence” and puts at risk public confidence in constitutional institutions.
According to the senator, “The legal framework, constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court, and principles of natural justice all require that convictions must be final (i.e., all appeals decided) and disqualifications under Article 62(1)(f) must be based on a judicial declaration.”
It may be noted that before these nine lawmakers, Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Bhachar, MNA Abdul Latif from Chitral, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, and MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha had already been disqualified in the last week of July.
On July 15, Jamshed Dasti was also disqualified over “fake academic credentials”.
The commission had also announced a schedule for a by-election on the seat it had declared vacant following his disqualification, which it had to reverse on Tuesday in light of a Lahore High Court order.
“Pursuant to the order dated 30th July, 2025, passed by the Honourable Lahore High Court…the election programme for the conduct of by-election in NA-175 Muzaffargarh-l…is hereby suspended till further order of the Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore in the above titled case,” a notification issued by the ECP read.

His appeal comes as the Islamabad High Court (IHC) reserved its verdict on petitions against the proposed auction of Bahria Town properties. The assets were attached in connection with a plea bargain agreement reached in the £190 million case. The development adds on to the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) previous actions against Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an absconder in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
NAB had said last month that the tycoon and his son Ali Riaz had entered into a plea bargain in the 190 million pounds case, but failed to pay the agreed amount. As a result, NAB had sought details of several properties, which were to be auctioned to recover the amount under Sec­tion 33E of NAB Ordinance, 1999.
In 2019, the National Crime Agency (NCA) of the United Kingdom had agreed to a settlement worth £190 million with Riaz’s family. Earlier that year, the Supreme Court had accepted Riaz’s offer of Rs460 billion as settlement dues by his Bahria Town after it was found to have illegally acquired thousands of acres of land on Karachi’s outskirts in district Malir. Hours after the NCA verdict, Riaz had tweeted that the recovered amount would go to the Supreme Court against the fine worth Rs460bn. Subsequently, the money was transferred to the Supreme Court’s accounts, instead of the government’s account.
On October 20, 2023, the Supreme Court had noted that “only Rs60.72bn out of Rs460bn was paid. Even out of this payment, Bahria Town paid only Rs24.26bn”.
In a post on X today, Riaz said: “I would like to make a final appeal from the bottom of my heart that we be given a chance to return to serious dialogue, and a dignified solution.
“For this purpose, we assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent,” the property tycoon added. “On this occasion, I also assure you that if the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing.”
Riaz said that he had confidence that the institutions of Pakistan would act “with justice, wisdom, and prudence, and they will play a positive role in leading us out of this difficult juncture”.
 






Riaz also said that Bahria Town’s operations across the country had been severely paralysed.
“Our cash flow has been completely destroyed, it has become impossible to provide daily services, we are unable to pay the salaries of our tens of thousands of staff, and the situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” Riaz said.
However, he added, “We are certainly one step behind this last step, but the situation on the ground is getting worse by the minute.”
 
 

Last month, the IHC issued notices to respondents on a petition of NAB seeking to vacate the stay order on its move to auction six properties of Bahria Town in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
In June, NAB ordered the freezing of over 450 immovable properties owned by various individuals named in the Bahria Town Karachi land grab case.
In the same month, the IHC had issued a stay order halting the NAB’s planned auction of Bahria Town’s properties. The auction was scheduled to be held the same day, i.e. June 12.</p><small>2025-08-05 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05150956aa19c67.jpg?r=151008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928884/police-detain-pti-activists-in-lahore-karachi-amid-protests-marking-2-years-of-imrans-imprisonment' target='_blank'><strong>Police detain PTI activists in Lahore, Karachi amid protests marking 2 years of Imran’s imprisonment</strong></a><br><p>Police personnel detained PTI protesters in Lahore and Karachi on Tuesday after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of ex-premier Imran Khan, who has been in jail for two years now.
Imran, imprisoned since Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in alleged terrorism cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Imran had issued a nationwide protest call, with a statement attributed to him saying that the “movement that begins on August 5 will continue until democracy is restored in its true spirit”. According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 was the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a “final call”.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn.com: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.”
He denied reports of the police arresting hundreds of activists.
At around 1pm, the PTI claimed that one of its leaders, Rehana Dar, had been detained by the police in Lahore.
“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said on its official X account.
It shared a video showing Dar, who contested the 2024 general elections in Sialkot against PML-N’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, being dragged into a police van by personnel with riot gear.
The PTI said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar “have sunk to a new low with this act” and “abandoned all sense of shame and decency”.
 






Raja Shahbaz Bhatti, president of the PTI’s Insaf Youth Wing in north Punjab, claimed on X that he was injured due to police action and that four others were arrested.
The PTI’s Multan chapter alleged that its Lahore rally was “attacked by police”, with multiple vehicles participating in it facing damage. Visuals shared by it showed the back window of a car shattered with a hole in it.
 






PTI Balochistan President Dawood Shah Kakar claimed “several” PTI workers, including five leaders, were arrested after they gathered at a place in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest.
 






Qaiser yesterday said raids had begun in Punjab and Kashmir, while PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir claimed that the police carried out some 200 raids and picked up party workers, who were released after allegedly submitting affidavits.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari mocked the protest turnout, alleging that the PTI was inflating the crowd size by stopping traffic.
 






 






Separately, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam criticised the PTI for choosing today’s date for its protest and said it took away attention from the Kashmir dispute, PTV News reported.
Opposition leaders stopped while heading to Adiala Jail
Ahead of today’s planned protests, the Rawalpindi administration banned all assemblies and gatherings till August 10 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, citing an “imminent threat”.
Today, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai, MNA Shandana Gulzar and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned, the party said at 3pm.
“We will record our protest under any circumstance as it is our Constitutional right,” Achakzai said on X.
However, they were stopped by the Punjab police, with the TTAP sharing a video of Achakzai’s exchange with the personnel. “This route is closed,” a cop was heard saying.
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur also separately led a convoy in Peshawar.
 






According to other videos it posted, the party organised rallies in various cities across the country.
Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir premier Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, who was recently detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance, also led a rally after his last-night release, the PTI said.
KP protests
The PTI also shared a video of convoys departing from Peshawar, Mansehra and other cities for Swabi.
The Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway was closed at 5pm at Swabi Interchange and both lines from Peshawar and Islamabad remained closed despite the various attempts made by the Motorway Police. The police failed to persuade the PTI workers, due to which the motorway has remained closed and commuters were forced to wait on the side of the road in scorching heat.
The motorway was opened at 7:30pm when the gathering was dispersed.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser alleged that Imran was offered to be allowed to go home, but he turned down such offers and declared that he would not go anywhere but continue the struggle for Pakistan from jail.
He criticised the parties in government for losing the people’s trust and lashed out at them for the sugar scandal.
“The people will not allow the operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under any circumstances. This is the decision of the people and the general public does not want any more operations here,” he said.
He said that their agenda was constitutional supremacy, true authority of the Parliament according to the Constitution and democratic principles and norms.
“We have launched a movement today which will focus on releasing of our leader, Imran Khan, immediate withdrawal of all fake cases against him, supremacy of the Parliament, upholding of country’s Constitution in all circumstances and people’s civil rights, independence of judiciary and let the people and leaders and religious parties to express thier views without any fear and hesitation.”
He announced that the second phase of the PTI’s efforts would take place on August 14, after which the party planned to head to Sindh. “We will unite the entire country to rid ourselves of this oppressive government,” he concluded.
 






PTI workers from Malakand division gathered at Lower Dir’s Chakdara interchange, where their local leaders addressed the major rally.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan led a rally from his home district of Buner.
Provincial Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Syed Fakhar Jahan addressed a big protest demonstration at Sawari Chowk, Buner. Barrister Gohar was also present on the occasion.
The provincial minister said on the occasion that Imran was unjustly imprisoned for two years. He said PTI MNAs and MPAs were also being intimidated, illegally arrested and the rights of people were being violated, while their families were also being harassed.
Another big rally was held in the Khairabad area of Nowshera district where MPAs and provincial ministers were present.
The protest demonstration in Khairabad escalated into chaos as workers and party leaders clashed. The workers demanded that the protest leadership travel to Islamabad, saying that they had not come to listen to rote speeches but to engage in practical action.
They expressed frustration over being repeatedly asked to rally in the streets only to return without taking further action.
Party leaders and MPAs present on the stage abruptly left without delivering their speeches. Consequently, the workers exited the pavilion, sat down on GT Road, and began a protest that blocked the road, refusing to open it despite persistent requests from party leaders.
Police resort to tear gas shelling, baton charge to foil PTI rally in Karachi
In Sindh, the Karachi Police resorted to tear gas shelling and baton charge to disperse the PTI rally in the city, according to witnesses, police and party officials.
PTI Sindh spokesperson Muhammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn.com that as part of the party’s call, small rallies were held across the metropolis, which reached their scheduled protest venue at Hassan Square in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
The protest rally was being led by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh. When they reached near Jail Chowrangi, contingents of the police that had already blocked the main University Road by parking vehicles in the middle of it or creating temporary barriers resorted to “massive” tear gas shelling and baton charge.
He alleged that around 25-30 workers, including females, were injured who took shelter in nearby homes where the residents provided them first aid, while around 15-20 others were arrested.
 






He said such actions were also taken by law enforcers in other parts of Sindh, as over 200 workers were allegedly arrested.
The police justified their action over the lack of permission for the rally, the alleged blockade of the road and creating a law and order situation.
Karachi Police chief Javed Alam Odho told Dawn.com that when protests tended to take place against power shortage, law enforcers took action against any road blockade and violence.
Without going into details of the police action, the city police chief said: “The rally was taken without permission from the concerned authorities. They blocked the road and created a law and order situation, necessitating police action.”
However, Bozdar told Dawn.com that when other parties took out rallies without permission, they were not subjected to the same treatment and wondered why such a discriminatory attitude was meted out against the PTI.
He said the party did not block the main University Road and had instead held a rally on only one side of the road.
 






Meanwhile, an incident report from the Bilal Colony station house officer said two PTI protesters were arrested from 4K Chowrangi.
Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry lament Imran’s imprisonment
Separately, former PTI leaders Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry, both of whom had parted ways with the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, also lamented Imran’s two-year-long incarceration.
Umar, a former finance minister, said on X: “Even two years after Imran Khan’s imprisonment, the anti-Khan narrative did not sell, and the public believes that Khan is imprisoned on political grounds, not legal ones.
“Do not waste more time; the entire national leadership should sit with the PTI and carve out a solution in accordance with the Constitution,” he suggested, adding that there was no other way to end the ongoing political crisis.
 






Chaudhry said Imran was in jail “just for the sake of democracy in Pakistan and people’s sovereignty”.

“PTV Sports proudly announces the acquisition of television rights in Pakistan for all ACC events from 2025 to 2027!” it said in a post on Instagram.
It said the events included in the package were the Men’s Asia Cup 2025 and 2027, Women’s Asia Cup 2026 and the U19 and Emerging Asia Cup tournaments.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The Men’s Asia Cup is scheduled to be held from September 9 to 28 at its new venue — the United Arab Emirates — where it was shifted from original hosts India, due to Pakistan-India political tensions and also due to stra­ins between India and Bangladesh.
Dawn previously learnt that this year’s Asia Cup was facing a fresh challenge from the broadcaster.
A highly exorbitant rate set for Pakistan’s region by the official broadcaster of the Asia Cup based in India, plus the uncertainty prevailing over the pinnacle clash of the event between Pakistan and India, the chances were bleak that any sports channel in Pakistan could buy the broadcasting rights for the continental showpiece.
According to well-informed sources, Asia Cup’s official broadcaster had set a significantly higher rate for Pakistan’s region. It was learnt that the broadcaster, having secured Pan-Asia broadcast rights in a $170 million deal valid until 2031, was demanding that Pakistani broadcasters pay a staggering 25 per cent of the total broadcasting rights value, whereas the country was contributing no more than 10pc of the event’s regional broadcast worth.
“A 10-12pc value rate for Pakistan’s region is decided in the books of the ICC and the ACC but the Indian broadcaster is demanding a very high rate from Pakistan’s sports channels that are interested in covering live matches.
“It ultimately may force all Pakistan-based channels, either to make a joint consortium to buy the rights or to quit the race altogether,” one of the officials close to the situation had told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.
“They [Indian broadcasters] are over-leveraged and gambling with market stability. If this backfires, the repercussions could destabilise the entire ecosystem,” the official had added.
He had continued: “The consortium [of Pakistan sports channels] may agree to pay higher rate but there is no clarity if an Indo-Pak match will be played [during the Asia Cup].”
With television advertising revenue in Pakistan down more than 22pc year-on-year, and corporate sponsorship budgets in freefall, these inflated demands from the (Asia Cup) broadcaster appeared not only unrealistic, but dangerously detached from commercial reality, sources were claiming.
Another point of worry for Pakistan sports channels was also increased manifold as the Indian broadcasters had sold out the Asia Cup digital rights to a Pakistan-based consortium for approximately $4.3m.
In case India and Pakistan reach the Asia Cup final, they will have played three matches against each other in the event, a big deal for broadcasters.
“[The] Indian cricketers are facing pressure from their fans at home, creating a situation which may compel India’s top players to refuse to play the Asia Cup or even the BCCI to quit as hosts,” the source had added.
“In such a negative situation prevailing [currently] while time is running short to meet the Indian broadcasters’ demand, it does not seem possible for a single sports channel in Pakistan to strike the [broadcasting] deal on these [higher] rates.
“While the negotiations are on with the Asia Cup’s official broadcaster, it is not ready to demand less from Pakistan’s region even in case there is no Pakistan-India clash in the continental event,” the source had revealed.
In the past, when a Pakistan-India bilateral series was part of the ICC’s decided schedule of activities, the Pakistan Cricket Board had to sign a deal with broadcasters for the entire calendar for two different likely scenarios — first, if India and Pakistan play in a bilateral series and second, if they do not face each other.
Also, a PTV official, on the condition of anonymity, had told Dawn that uncertainty was prevailing for Pakistan over the Asia Cup broadcasting rights.
“In negotiations with the official broadcasters, we are trying to resolve the matter to ensure Pakistan fans watch live matches of the Asia Cup. However, the situation is tricky and no one can say what will happen in the end,” the PTV official had said.</p><small>2025-08-05 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/052047284edeaf6.jpg?r=205618' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869/bangladesh-to-hold-elections-in-february-2026-yunus' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh to hold elections in February 2026: Yunus</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh will hold elections in February 2026, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday, the first polls since a mass uprising overthrew the government last year.
“On behalf of the interim government, I will write a letter to the chief election commissioner requesting that the election be arranged before Ramazan in February 2026,” Yunus said in a broadcast on the one-year anniversary of the ousting of ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 85, is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections, and has said he will step down after the vote.
“We will step into the final and most important phase after delivering this speech to you, and that is the transfer of power to an elected government,” he said.
Yunus had earlier said elections would be held in April, but key political parties have been demanding he hold them earlier and before the month of Ramazan.
“I urge you all to pray for us so that we can hold a fair and smooth election, enabling all citizens to move forward successfully in building a ‘New Bangladesh’,” he added.
“On behalf of the government, we will extend all necessary support to ensure that the election is free, peaceful and celebratory in spirit. “
In an earlier address, he said: “Together, we will build a Bangladesh where tyranny will never rise again.”
He paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.
“Fallen autocrats and their self-serving allies remain active,” however, he added, urging unity to protect the gains of the uprising while his government holds reform talks with political parties and civil society.
His interim government had launched sweeping reforms, he added, while trials for those responsible for the “July killings” were progressing swiftly.
 
 

Police were on high alert throughout the capital, with armoured vehicles patrolling the streets to deter any attempt by Hasina’s banned Awami League to disrupt the day’s events.
“Let this anniversary not be a day of retrospection, but a rallying cry for a brighter tomorrow,” Hasina said in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh, adding that she had never resigned from her duties as prime minister.
“Bangladesh has overcome adversity before, and we will rise again, stronger, more united, and more determined to build a democracy that truly serves its people.”
The July Declaration formally recognises the 2024 student-led uprising and the shift away from authoritarian rule to democratic renewal.
Despite some opposition, it is backed by major political groups, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former premier Khaleda Zia.
Supporters see the charter as a foundation for institutional reform; critics have warned its impact could be largely symbolic in the absence of a legal framework or parliamentary consensus.</p><small>2025-08-05 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617452-uk-opens-fully-funded-chevening-scholarships-for-pakistanis' target='_blank'><strong>UK opens 'fully-funded' Chevening scholarships for Pakistanis</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir’s special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.
On Aug 5, 2019, India’s Narendra Modi-led government stripped the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing Article 370 of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.
“India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India’s continued rogue behaviour,” PM Shehbaz said in a statement.
 


The premier also recalled the recent India-Pakistan conflict, noting: “India’s unprovoked aggression against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive military defeat are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.
“The will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, are the only path forward,” he stressed.
PM Shehbaz noted that a “just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy”.
The prime minister reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
 
 

He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the “wider hegemonic and extremist agenda” that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.
“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he asserted.
Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unflinching” stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.
Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that “this year’s ‘Youm-e-Istehsal’ assumes greater significance”.
“While the resounding success of the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,” the president said.
 






He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK’s demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.
“These measures include gerrymandering of the electoral constituencies, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of domicile certificates to outsiders, granting more powers to the lieutenant governor in administrative matters, and introduction of new laws on ownership of land and property,” he noted.
“The Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‘cordon and search’ operations have become a matter of routine,” Zardari said.
To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.
 






Special walks and events are being held across all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. A one-minute silence was also observed at 10am to express solidarity with Kashmiris, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistani missions abroad were also set to organise special events in connection with Youm-i-Istehsal.
Dar condemns reports of India planning to maintain held Kashmir as union territory
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar underscored that Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute, and its future cannot be determined through internal legislation or court rulings, Radio Pakistan reported.
Addressing the rally in Islamabad, Dar expressed concern over media reports suggesting that Indian authorities are attempting to grant statehood to Jammu while retaining the Kashmir Valley as a union territory.
He condemned such moves as “unacceptable and provocative”.
India’s top court is also set to hear a petition tomorrow that seeks directives to the federal government to restore the statehood of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Hindustan Times reported, citing Live Law.
 


The foreign minister reaffirmed Islamabad’s desire for friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and its preference for dialogue and diplomacy over confrontation.
However, he warned that Pakistan’s armed forces and its people were “fully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated” during the May conflict.
Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were “eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy”.
Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as Burhan Wani, were wrapped in the “colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan”.
Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the “victory in Marka-i-Haq has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses”.
NA passes resolution condemning ‘all forms of Indian state violence’
In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning “all forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail”.
The lower house of the parliament reiterated that “Pakistan will never compromise on the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination as guaranteed under international law and UN resolutions”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The resolution was moved by Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam in Urdu and by PPP MNA Shazia Marri in English.
 


The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was “not an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
It called upon the global community to “stand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses” in IoK.  The NA declared that “from Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir”, Radio Pakistan added.
The NA affirmed that Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained “unshakable and enduring”, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.
The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.
India’s repressive actions only perpetuate human suffering: ISPR
The armed forces also emphasised that it was “unequivocally evident that durable peace in South Asia remains unattainable without the just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”.
In a press release, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu and the armed forces reaffirmed their “unwavering solidarity with the resilient and courageous people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK)”.
“India’s repressive actions, coupled with its belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric, serve only to exacerbate regional instability and perpetuate human suffering,” the ISPR noted.
 






It added: “The armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.
“The continued illegal occupation of IIOJK by Indian security forces — characterised by an unrelenting military siege, systemic human rights violations, and demographic engineering — constitutes a grave breach of international norms and remains a matter of deep concern.
The armed forces “pay solemn tribute to the martyrs of IIOJK and reiterate their enduring commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for freedom”.
India’s top court to hear Kashmir statehood plea
Separately, court officials said today that India’s top court will hear a plea for the restoration of Kashmir’s federal statehood later this week.
The hearing, scheduled for August 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents.
The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the region’s special status, was challenged by Kashmir’s pro-India political parties, the local Bar Association and individual litigants.
The Supreme Court in December 2023 upheld removing the region’s autonomy but called for Jammu and Kashmir to be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian federal state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”.
“We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.
“It has been quite some time since the court asked for it and elections have also been successfully held.”
Last November, the territory elected its first government since it was brought under New Delhi’s direct control, as voters backed opposition parties to lead its regional assembly.
But the local government has limited powers and the territory continues to be, for all practical purposes, governed by a New Delhi-appointed administrator.
Indian security forces were deployed in force in the Himalayan territory today, eyeing protests demanding the restoration of its special status.</p><small>2025-08-05 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617438-govt-ensuring-safe-smooth-travel-for-pilgrims-to-iraq-and-iran-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Govt ensuring safe, smooth travel for pilgrims to Iraq, Iran: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>
