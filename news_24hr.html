Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on March 2 after ceasefire talks broke down. In late May, it began allowing a small trickle of aid to resume, amid warnings of a wave of starvation.
Yesterday alone, over 50 more Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes and shootings, some as they waited near aid distribution centres, the Palestinian civil defence agency said.
The pause in fighting would be limited to areas where the military says Israeli troops are not currently operating — Al-Mawasi, Deir el-Balah and Gaza City — and last from 10am (12pm PKT) until 8pm every day.
 


The military also claimed it had begun air-dropping food into the territory and rejected allegations it was using starvation as a weapon against Palestinian civilians.
In a statement, the army said it coordinated its decisions with the UN and international organisations to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip”.
There was no immediate official response from the UN or non-governmental aid agencies operating in Gaza, and privately sceptical humanitarian sources said they were waiting to see the results on the ground of the Israeli announcement.
The Israeli statement added that “designated secure routes” had been opened across all of Gaza to enable the safe passage of UN and humanitarian aid organisation convoys delivering and distributing food and medicine.
The Israeli military insisted these operations, alongside its ongoing campaign against Palestinian armed groups, should disprove “the false claim of deliberate starvation in the Gaza Strip”.
Before Israel announced the airborne delivery of seven pallets of food, the United Arab Emirates had said it would restart aid drops and Britain said it would work with partners, including Jordan, to assist them.
“We ask God and our Arab brothers to work harder to reach a ceasefire before we all die,” Gaza resident Hossam Sobh told AFP, adding that he had feared death as he recovered a bag of flour under the nose of an Israeli tank.
Activist boat seized by Israeli troops
Also on Saturday, Israeli troops boarded a boat carrying activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition as it attempted to approach Gaza from the sea to challenge a naval blockade.
 






“Israeli forces illegally boarded ‘Handala’ in international waters, abducting 21 unarmed civilians,” the FFC said on X, sharing a video that showed purported Israeli soldiers taking away the activists.
“Demand your government end its complicity in Israeli war crimes, ensure the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, and call for the immediate release of all crew members,” the coalition said.
The boat carries at least five citizens from the United States, three from France, two from Italy, Spain and Australia, and one each from the United Kingdom, Norway and Tunisia.

The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory has gravely deteriorated in recent days, with more than 100 NGOs warning this week that “mass starvation” was spreading in Gaza.
On Telegram, the Israeli military announced it “carried out an airdrop of humanitarian aid as part of the ongoing efforts to allow and facilitate the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip”.
Humanitarian chiefs are deeply sceptical that air drops can deliver enough food safely to tackle the deepening hunger crisis facing Gaza’s more than two million inhabitants.
But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the idea, vowing to work with Jordan to restart air drops. The United Arab Emirates said it would resume air drops “immediately”.
‘Starving civilians’
A number of Western and Arab governments carried out air drops in Gaza in 2024, when aid deliveries by land also faced Israeli restrictions, but many in the humanitarian community consider them ineffective.
“Air drops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians.”
 






Israel’s military insists it does not limit the number of trucks going into Gaza, and alleges that UN agencies and relief groups are not collecting aid once it is inside the territory.
But humanitarian organisations accuse the army of imposing excessive restrictions, while tightly controlling road access within Gaza.
A separate aid operation is under way through the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
But it has faced fierce international criticism after Israeli fire killed hundreds of Palestinians near distribution points.
Naval blockade
On Saturday evening, the live feed on the Handala boat belonging to pro-Palestinian activist group Freedom Flotilla showed Israeli troops boarding the vessel.
The soldiers moved in as the boat approached Gaza and three video live feeds of the scene broadcasting online were cut minutes later.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency and other parties.
Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The Israeli campaign has killed 59,733 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><small>2025-07-27 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615995-pakistan-us-ties-must-not-be-viewed-via-china-lens-says-dar-after-rubio-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-US ties must not be viewed via China lens, says Dar after Rubio meeting</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
The latest cases include two from the districts of Lakki Marwat and North Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and one from Sindh’s Umerkot district, a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme (PPEP) said.
A 15-month-old girl from Takhtikhel in Lakki Marwat district, a six-month-old girl from Mir Ali in North Waziristan, and a five-year-old boy from Chajro in district Umerkot, Sindh, are the latest polio cases confirmed by the laboratory.
With these new detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has risen to 17 — including ten from KP, five from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
A special vaccination campaign was held from July 21-27 in the bordering area of KP and Balochistan to coincide with Afghanistan’s sub-national polio campaign.
In addition, a fractional vaccination campaign began in Chaman on July 21 and will roll out in six districts of Balochistan from July 28.
“Despite substantial progress in polio eradication efforts, the continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent risk to children, especially in areas where vaccine acceptance remains low.
“It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can resurface wherever immunity gaps exist. Every unvaccinated child is at risk and can also pose a risk to others,” the statement said.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-07-27 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271255178aea3e4.jpg?r=125611' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926916/thailand-cambodia-clash-continues-despite-ceasefire-hopes' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand, Cambodia clash continues despite ceasefire hopes</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia clashed for a fourth day on Sunday, despite both sides saying they were ready to discuss a ceasefire after a late-night intervention by US President Donald Trump.
The neighbours, popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists, have been locked in their bloodiest conflict in years over the disputed border, with at least 33 people confirmed killed and more than 200,000 displaced.
Both said they were willing to start talks to end the fighting, after Trump spoke to the two prime ministers late on Saturday and said they had agreed to meet and “quickly work out” a ceasefire.
But fresh artillery clashes erupted on Sunday morning near two long-contested ancient temples in the frontier region between northern Cambodia and northeast Thailand, which has seen the bulk of the fighting.
Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said Thai forces began attacking areas around the temples at 4:50am (6:50am PKT).
The regular thump of artillery rattled windows in the Cambodian town of Samraong, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the frontline, AFP journalists said.
 
 

Thai Army Deputy Spokesman Ritcha Suksuwanon said Cambodian forces began firing artillery around 4am (6am PKT) as the two sides battled for control of strategic positions.
Ceasefire calls
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Sunday said his country “agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces”.
He said his Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn will talk to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to coordinate with the Thais, but warned Bangkok against reneging on any agreement.
After Trump’s call, Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said he had agreed in principle to enter a ceasefire and start talks “as soon as possible”.
While both sides have expressed a desire for talks to end the crisis, neither has so far been willing to back down. On Sunday, they again each blamed the other for undermining peace efforts.
The Thai foreign ministry also accused Cambodian forces of firing shells into civilian homes in Surin province.
“Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
From the Cambodian side, defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata issued a statement denying that they fired first.
The statement accused Thailand of “deliberate and coordinated acts of aggression”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into combat this week with jets, tanks and ground troops battling in the rural border region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and agricultural land where locals farm rubber and rice.
Thailand says seven of its soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.
The conflict has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, and 80,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted “an immediate ceasefire” and a peaceful resolution of the dispute.
UN chief Antonio Guterres urged both sides on Saturday to “immediately agree to a ceasefire” and hold talks to find a lasting solution.
As well as blaming each other for starting the fight, Cambodia has also accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions, while Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours over their shared 800-kilometre border, where dozens of kilometres are contested.</p><small>2025-07-27 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2712042251ec868.jpg?r=122727' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926914/8-dead-18-injured-in-bus-accident-on-islamabad-lahore-motorway-in-chakwal' target='_blank'><strong>8 dead, 18 injured in bus accident on Islamabad-Lahore Motorway in Chakwal</strong></a><br><p>Eight passengers died and 18 others were injured after the bus they were travelling on fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district on Sunday morning.
According to a spokesperson of Chakwal Rescue 1122, the bus was heading to Lahore from Islamabad when one of its tyres burst near the Balkassar Interchange on the Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2).
The driver lost control of the bus, causing the vehicle to fall into a ditch and overturn. As a result, eight passengers died on the spot, while 18 others were injured, the spokesperson added.
Rescue 1122 had dispatched six rescue vehicles to the crash site, while personnel of National Highways and Motorway Police, the Chakwal police and a team of the Frontier Works Organisation also reached the incident site.
The injured were rushed to Kallar Kahar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and Chakwal District Headquarters Hospital, where the bodies were also taken.

Dr Mukhtar Sarwar Niazi, medical superintendent at Chakwal DHQ Hospital,  told Dawn.com that four out of 12 injured persons brought there were “critically injured” and were being referred to Rawalpindi.
According to the Rescue 1122 statement, there were between 35-40 passengers on the bus.
As per the list issued by the rescue service, the dead included three children — aged eight months, one year and two years — and the eldest person was aged 45 years. The injured were aged between 14 and 55 years.
Chakwal District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin took notice of the incident and sent a team comprising senior police officials. “The site has been cordoned off and police are acting as per law”, a spokesperson of Chakwal Police said.
Chakwal Rescue and Safety Officer Shaukat Ali said: “Our rescue teams responded with professional expertise, providing immediate medical aid to the injured and transporting the deceased to the hospital.”
He urged the public to ensure complete vehicle fitness checks — especially tyre, brake and steering system inspections — before embarking on long journeys to prevent such tragic incidents.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
 
 

On July 13, six people lost their lives while 27 others were injured as a bus carrying them crashed on the M2 motorway near Chakri Interchange.
On February 28, eight passengers were killed while over 40 were injured on the same motorway when a Karachi-bound bus fell into a ditch near Bhagal village, a few kilometres away from Balkassar Interchange.
In August last year, 27 passengers were injured when a bus overturned on the M-2 near the Sial Mor service area.</p><small>2025-07-27 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271124377682b72.jpg?r=112443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926908/at-least-6-crushed-to-death-at-temple-stampede-in-indias-uttarakhand' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 crushed to death at temple stampede in India’s Uttarakhand</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were crushed to death at a popular Hindu temple in northern India’s Uttarakhand state on Sunday, officials said, after a massive crowd surge.
The stampede occurred on the stairway leading to the Mansa Devi temple in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges River, and left many injured.
“Six dead and more than 10 injured are admitted to the hospital,” senior city police official Parmendra Dobhal told AFP.
Uttarkhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said relief and rescue operations were underway.
“I am constantly in touch with the local administration regarding this matter, and continuous monitoring of the situation is being done,” he said in a statement.
Deadly stampedes and crowd crushes are a common occurrence at Indian religious festivals.
In June, a sudden crowd surge at a Hindu festival in the coastal state of Odisha triggered a stampede that killed at least three people and injured several others.
The previous month, six people were crushed to death in the western state of Goa after thousands gathered for a popular fire-walking ritual.
And in January, at least 30 people were killed in an early morning crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu mega-festival in the northern city of Prayagraj.</p><small>2025-07-27 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615984-gb-seeks-centres-assistance-as-rain-flash-floods-inflict-over-rs20bn-in-losses' target='_blank'><strong>GB seeks Centre's assistance as rains, flash floods inflict over Rs20bn in losses</strong></a><br><p>

Mehdi Hassani and Behrouz Ehsani-Eslamloo, “operational elements” of the MEK, were sentenced to death in a verdict upheld by the Supreme Court, Mizan said.
“The terrorists, in coordination with MEK leaders, had set up a team house in Tehran, where they built launchers and hand-held mortars in line with the group’s goals, fired projectiles heedlessly at citizens, homes, service and administrative facilities, educational and charity centres, and also carried out propaganda and information-gathering activities in support of the MEK,” the report said.
The defendants were indicted with “moharebeh”, an Islamic term meaning waging war against God, destroying public property and “membership in a terrorist organisation with the aim of disrupting national security”.
Semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Sunday that Ehsani-Eslamloo had been arrested in 2022 following an explosion at the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology claimed by the MEK.
The MEK, known in English as People’s Mujahideen Organisation of Iran, was a powerful leftist-Islamist group that staged bombing campaigns against the shah’s government and US targets in the 1970s but ultimately fell out with the other factions of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Since then, the MEK has opposed the Islamic Republic, and its leadership in exile has been Paris-based. The group was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and the European Union until 2012.</p><small>2025-07-27 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27093145ceaaf5f.jpg?r=093355' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926853/dispute-erupts-over-punjab-cotton-output-data' target='_blank'><strong>Dispute erupts over Punjab cotton output data</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A major controversy has emerged over the methodology used by the Crop Reporting Centre (CRC) Punjab in determining provincial cotton output, with serious allegations of inflated and misleading statistics surfacing.
It has been revealed that CRC Punjab is allegedly estimating total cotton production using hypothetical calculations — extrapolating yields based on the number of bolls per plant across an acre or, in some districts, from small sample plots as small as eight feet by six feet.
This has exposed a long-standing discrepancy between the figures reported by CRC Punjab and those of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), with the former consistently reporting significantly higher production.
Ihsan-ul-Haq, Chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, stated that this variance has long complicated decision-making for stakeholders in the cotton industry. He noted that while some attribute the CRC’s inflated figures to unrecorded lint sales by certain ginners, the presence of two conflicting national datasets has damaged Pakistan’s credibility in international cotton forums.
“As of July 15, the PCGA reported Punjab’s cotton production at 145,000 bales, while CRC Punjab claimed 335,000 bales — a staggering difference,” Haq said, adding that such figures appear divorced from ground realities. “It is entirely inaccurate to determine provincial output from a handful of bolls or a couple of micro-plots,” he stressed.

CRC’s figures sharply contradict PCGA data, raising concerns over planning and international credibility

He urged the CRC to adopt a more grounded data collection approach, similar to that of the PCGA, which gathers cotton and lint sales and stock data on a fortnightly basis from every ginning factory. Haq proposed that CRC staff collect real-time data from ginneries and grain markets to provide more accurate and credible figures.
 
 

In response, CRC Punjab Director-General Dr Abdul Qayyum defended the Centre’s methodology. Speaking to Dawn by phone, he said around 1,600 staff members in cotton-growing areas gather data weekly from approximately 4,000 locations.
“Our teams measure boll size and weight, count bolls per plant, and monitor picking activity in the field,” he explained.
Dr Qayyum asserted that the CRC’s calculations are based on standardised field practices with no incentive to inflate or deflate figures. He attributed the divergence from PCGA data to differences in collection points.
“While we report from the picking stage, PCGA collects data at the ginning stage — where under-invoicing by ginners to evade sales tax is a known issue, as acknowledged by the industry itself,” he said.
Despite these explanations, the growing gap between CRC and PCGA data continues to raise concern among cotton stakeholders, who warn that unreliable production figures could undermine effective policymaking and market confidence.

In a judgment, the judge highlighted inefficiencies in the prosecution’s handling of case records and proposed the use of WhatsApp as a tool to streamline the process.
The judge noted that delays in providing case records to prosecutors often waste valuable judicial time.
The judge had taken notice of the situation during the hearing of a post-arrest bail petition, when he observed a female deputy prosecutor general attempting to collect the facts haphazardly to respond to the queries of the court.
Asked by the court, the prosecutor said the record of the case had just been tabled before her in the court.
Being irked with the response and waste of precious time of the court, the judge had summoned the prosecutor general of Punjab.
Justice Rafiq criticised the practice of physically transporting documents that could easily be shared electronically.
To address this issue, the judge directed the prosecutor general of Punjab to implement guidelines ensuring that police officers share detailed fact sheets and progress reports with prosecutors via WhatsApp or other approved electronic platforms at least one day prior to hearings.
The judge further instructed the prosecutor general to establish a mechanism for obtaining WhatsApp numbers of police officers responsible for producing records in court. These numbers are to be shared with prosecutors to facilitate real-time communication and ensure timely submission of case details.
The judge noted that this approach would save judicial time and enhance the effectiveness of prosecution efforts.
Justice Rafiq highlighted the importance of prosecutors exercising their powers independently and in the public interest as mandated by the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 2006.
He also highlighted the need for disciplinary action against any dereliction in adhering to these guidelines.
SUMMONED: An anti-terrorism court has summoned the investigating officers and prosecution witnesses of alleged conspiracy of May 9 riots for cross-examination in two cases including the burning of Shadman police station.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill conducted the hearing inside Kot Lakhpat Jail.
The defence concluded cross-examination of four prosecution witnesses in the police station attack case.
Separately, cross-examination of eight other prosecution witnesses was also conducted in a May 9 case of burning police vehicles near Jinnah House.
The defence lawyers completed cross-examination of a total of 12 prosecution witnesses.
The judge adjourned further proceedings of the jail trial till July 28.
During the hearing, the attendance of detained accused including PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Punjab President Dr. Yasmin Rashid was marked.
In the Shadman police station attack case, 14 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders for not joining the hearing after securing bail.
The judge also adjourned the hearing of two other cases including the burning of police vehicles at Zaman Park till July 28.

He has already spent almost half of his young life abroad and is likely, if current indicators continue heading the way they are for the country, to spend just a handful more years here until he departs for good.
Therefore, the country and its myriad issues will never grip him the same way they grip me. He will never live or die on the successes and failures of this nation. It will be an abstract concept for him, a place where he spent some time, an ethnicity he identifies with, a memory bank of images: parents, grandmothers, dogs, school, friends, various chachas and bajis who helped him. At least, that’s what I think.
Children have a unique way of confounding their parents. Perhaps my father thought I would be the same. I doubt he would have imagined in a million years that I would end up doing the things I have done. But whatever my son chooses to do in his life, it struck me that I had never given him a context for the strange bond that ties me to this place. He will never understand me fully without that context. So, this is for him.
To say my relationship with Pakistan is a complex one, would be an understatement. I hate it. I love it. I can’t stand being here anymore. I can’t bear to be away. It is where my heart has been broken.  It is where I found love. It is where I have witnessed the power of humanity; it is where I have seen the heart of evil.  

What keeps us tethered to a country that appears rife with crime, injustice and death? In a personal essay, novelist and cop Omar Shahid Hamid unpacks his turbulent relationship with Pakistan in general, and Karachi in particular. Eos presents an excerpt from the essay ‘A Letter To My Son’ from the book Home #itscomplicated, recently published by Liberty Publishing…

Pakistan is a series of snapshots in my head. Standing in my  father’s office in the city courts, banging on his desk like a 10-year-old brat, thinking that my banging, like that of a judge’s gavel, would silence the arguing maulvis [religious clerics] sitting in front, forgetting that Pops was the District Magistrate and not I.
The searing heat of April, sweating through the cheap material of the Ghani Sons school uniform, standing under the old school bell, covered in rang, saying goodbye to friends on the last day of school as if we were going off to war. Eating Karachi Broast and Mezban’s toxic chicken corn soup at 2 a.m. on a chilly December night, discussing relationships that never were, pining over unrequited love and loss, and imagining that we would never face greater tragedy than this — how wrong we were!
 


Silly boys pretending to play gangsters, angered over some imagined slight (a friend’s girlfriend had dumped him and moved on to someone else; hardly a casus belli, but at the time, grounds for the high school equivalent of the Russian invasion of Ukraine), driven to fist-fighting ridiculously dressed in silk shirts. Who the f*** goes to a fistfight dressed in a baggy silk shirt? There was no fight, there never was, and the end result was the inevitable ‘compro’ conducted by some older, more menacing individual with shady connections. I have often wondered since, what those ‘compro’ specialists must have thought of us, a bunch of ‘burger boys’ pretending to be tough guys in a city that was already beginning to descend into its long night. 
Shards of glass, shining like diamonds on the asphalt road on a July morning when the humidity was already making Karachi an outdoor sauna at 8:30 in the morning; and a white 1992 Honda  Civic standing at the corner of the road at an odd angle, shredded with bullet holes like a piece of Swiss cheese. My father’s body, lying inert on the back seat and me peering in, not quite understanding that he was gone forever. The Karachi police chief, a Deputy Inspector General and a commander of a police force of 20,000 men, sitting in our dining room that evening and informing my mother that she should not register a case against the city’s most powerful political party or the head of that party, who sat thousands of miles away in suburban Edgware and controlled the city via satellite phone. 
The DIG’s argument was that he would not be able to guarantee our security, and my mother replying to him by saying she was going to do exactly that, and it was his job to protect us. Throngs of people coming to our house in the days and months that followed, many, including close family members and lifelong friends, admonishing us for having taken such a ‘position’, and distancing themselves. A much smaller number, people I will never forget, standing by us and commending our bravery.  
Almost two years later, a strange man, dressed in a starched white shalwar kameez, plops his glock pistol on to a glass tabletop in my grandfather’s house, twirls his handlebar moustache, and starts explaining to my mother and me how he arrested my father’s killer. Mistaking the shock on our faces for disbelief, he offers to take me to his police station to interrogate the suspect myself. And I, having never come across anyone as unique as this odd policeman called Chaudhry Aslam, slowly shake my head, mortified at the thought of having to go to a police station. To partake in an interrogation. Who does that? A thousand interrogations and hundreds of police stations later, I look back and laugh at the stupidity of my 20- year-old self.  

Pakistan will also teach me, repeatedly and bitterly, about betrayal. It is another summer’s day in 2005, cool and crisp because I am in Hub, Balochistan, and it is dawn. I am on my way to arrest one of the most notorious criminals of Karachi, and my thoughts turn to nothing more significant than the coolness of the morning. Little do I realise that within 20 minutes, I will be fighting for my life, ambushed and abandoned, my closest friends wounded, watching a friend and colleague bleed to death 10 feet from where I am taking cover. Those 10 feet feel like 10,000 because I am unable to reach him as we draw heavy and ceaseless fire. Wounded by shrapnel myself, I think, this is it.

It is hard to imagine at that moment, in the winter of 1998-99, but that odd policeman with the handlebar moustache will become one of my closest friends. In a strange way, he will inspire me to become a cop. Not a civil servant, fretting over summaries and memoranda, not a policeman, with the whiff of social order enforced by a Constable Carthorse-like figure implicit in that term, but a cop, with all the gritty and hard edges that implies.  
For those of us born in the last quarter of the 20th century, we have become used to drawing arbitrary lines to divide history. Perhaps the seminal events of the last century were so monumental that all that came after them seemed irrevocably altered. Thus, we have the world before the Great War to end all wars, and the world after; the world before the first brick was dislodged from the Berlin Wall, and everything after; the world before the planes hit the Twin Towers on  September 11th, and the one after; the world before Covid and post-Covid.
On a winter’s day in December 1998, a chance encounter will become my inflection point. It will divide my life into the world before and the world after. It will lead me down a path that I could never have imagined travelling, and it will take me to people and places that were once so far removed from my life that they would not only be unrecognisable but unfathomable to the me that existed before the crossroads in my personal history.  
It will create a thread that will lead, first of all, to an examination that nobody thinks I will be able to pass. It will take me out of the cocoon of Pakistan in which I had existed for the first two decades of my life, and immerse me in a much more real version of Pakistan.  Ultimately, for good or bad, it will bind me more tightly to this country than ever before.  
But it is a journey that will begin with tragedy. An August day in 2001, and my first day on the job as a trainee police officer. In the sweltering heat is a smell I will never forget. Cartons of orange juice concentrate gone bad and a rotting corpse in an abandoned house, and the faint whiff of bitter almonds, which I will later learn to recognise as a sign of cyanide. At the centre of it is a young man. He’s my contemporary, he is someone with whom I share common friends.  He had been in England at the same time as me, studied law as I had,  and returned home, flying in the face of compelling arguments not to do so, just as I had. It’s a strange sensation, staring at the decomposing body of someone so young, so full of life — so like me — and thinking: there, but for the grace of God, was me. 
 



Centuries of evolution in religion, philosophy and the construct of society have established this belief that it is wrong to desire a man’s death. But I have developed a slightly different philosophy after 17 years of simultaneously being a victim and a law enforcer. I believe that at heart, despite what we say, we are still a tribal people. When people, evil people, hurt us, when they kill our loved ones, when they subvert the law with impunity for decades, when they threaten to extinguish all hope, we hanker for revenge. Thus, when justice finally takes its course, no matter how barbaric it may appear, you cannot deny that it is cleansing, liberating and healing.  

It’s also the first time I find myself on the other side. As I stand outside this young man’s house, I watch his friends and relatives grieve. I see them trying to absorb the shock not only of a life brutally cut short well before its time, but also at the gruesome and fantastic details of the crime. The victim, kidnapped and killed by his next door neighbour, who continued to demand a ransom even after murdering the young man. A murder so bizarre it belongs in the pages of the Old Testament, and certainly not at the turn of the 21st century.
I look at them — many of them friends and acquaintances of mine as well, crying and wringing their hands at the injustice of this country. Just as I had done with many of them when my father was murdered, just four years prior. But I realise that something has changed. I will never wring my hands again. Instead of helplessly cursing the injustice of this world and those that perpetrate it, I will become someone who hunts those perpetrators. I will not always succeed. It wouldn’t be life if I did. But I will never feel powerless again.  
Life cannot only be about conflict. It has to be about love as well.  It is a late summer evening in 2003. In a truly sad Bollywood cliché, at my best friend’s wedding, I see a girl wearing a green…saree or a shalwar kameez, or something. All I remember is that it is green and her eyes are hazel and I know that if I don’t meet her, my life will never be complete. In the years to come, she will tell me about her faint disgust at my oily, gelled-back hair — despite the turn of the century, my fashion sense at the time remained firmly rooted in the 1980s — and the fact that I seemed to think that being a cop was actually a good thing. But despite her reservations about me, she will save me. She will keep on saving me every day for the following 20 years, and may just continue to do so for another 20 if I’m lucky.  
Pakistan will also teach me, repeatedly and bitterly, about betrayal. It is another summer’s day in 2005, cool and crisp because I am in Hub, Balochistan, and it is dawn. I am on my way to arrest one of the most notorious criminals of Karachi, and my thoughts turn to nothing more significant than the coolness of the morning. Little  do I realise that within 20 minutes, I will be fighting for my life,  ambushed and abandoned, my closest friends wounded, watching a  friend and colleague bleed to death 10 feet from where I am taking  cover. Those 10 feet feel like 10,000 because I am unable to reach him as we draw heavy and ceaseless fire. Wounded by shrapnel myself, I think, this is it. By some miracle, I manage to survive for the three hours that it takes reinforcements to make their way to our location.
In the months to come, as I recuperate, I seethe silently, and vow retribution against whoever set us up, thinking that no betrayal will ever be greater. And then fate says, “Hold my beer.” It’s a year later, and another deadlier and more diabolical betrayal strikes. It’s perpetrated by predatory colleagues taking advantage of my extraordinary naïveté, and it turns me into a fugitive overnight. It teaches me one of life’s most important lessons: just because you believe that you are just and good, it doesn’t mean shit to a world full of sharks. To survive and indeed, to thrive in this country, I will have to sacrifice a portion of my innocence. I will have to become a shark too.  
A friend once told me I have survivor’s guilt. Every few years, I get this feeling, and I ask myself why I survive while others around me are struck down. Starting with my father’s murder, to the day in Hub in 2005, when I see Arshad Butt die in front of my eyes, but  I live on, defying all logic; to a few months later when I flee the  country mere hours before my colleagues are arrested in a false case; to the conversation with one of my dearest friends from the police academy — a man who started his career with me on the mean streets of Karachi — just a day before he commits suicide in the District  Police Officer’s bungalow in Nankana Sahib. It is the most normal conversation I have ever had, and I curse myself for my obliviousness to his pain.
 

Police cordon off the area following the bombing that killed Chaudhry Aslam in Karachi on January 9, 2014: Aslam, who had survived numerous assassination attempts in the past, died when a suicide bomber smashed his vehicle into Aslam’s convoy on the Lyari Expressway in Karachi | AP

And then, of course, there is Aslam. The same policeman from that fateful day in 1998, who becomes a colleague, a mentor and a friend over the years. We survive the ordeal of Hub together, both wounded but functional. In 2010, I tell him to sacrifice a black goat, light a candle in a church, give alms in every Sufi shrine from Karachi to Kathmandu — anything we can do to thank the Almighty for the stroke of luck that made us shift our joint offices a week before a Taliban suicide team blew up our old offices, shattering the lives of 20 families. Our office furniture is still in the old premises. As far as close shaves go, it doesn’t get any closer.  
In 2011, Aslam and his family miraculously survive a ruthless attack on his house, an attack that appears even more ruthless in retrospect years later, when I arrest the perpetrators and discover that they were given the address by Aslam’s own bodyguard, the man who took his children to school. Again, it seems to me as if the angel of death has passed close enough to whisper in my ear, but has gone on to strike down someone else. Three months before the attack on his house, I have left for England, taking heed of various intelligence reports that indicate that both Aslam and I are on a Taliban hit-list.  That attack causes Aslam to enter into a death spiral with the terrorists, which will only end one way.  
For the remaining two-and-a-half years of his life, I will remain in London, giving counsel but no longer an active player in the game. I convince myself that I am out for good. But my wife doesn’t believe me. She keeps saying Pakistan still calls to me, still pulls at my heartstrings. Irony of ironies, the day Aslam is martyred, I am actually in Karachi, promoting the release of my first book. As I reach the scene of the crime and turn my eyes to the still-burning remains of his SUV, I cannot believe he is gone, and I have survived yet again.  
In 2016, I will prove my wife correct and return home. Friends in London will ask why I am putting my head in the lion’s mouth again.  Friends in Pakistan will say, why the f*** did you come back? But it doesn’t feel like entering the lion’s den. It just feels…normal. I return to my old office and the orderly greets me as if I had left last Tuesday, instead of five years ago. This place, this city, has a weird familiarity even as its fundamental nature changes. I travel around various cantons like a macabre tourist, recalling the crimes that have occurred on each street corner.  
There’s the Village Restaurant — great chicken tikkas and also, incidentally from where the American journalist, Daniel Pearl, was kidnapped. And here we have the Lyari Expressway, a modern marvel that means you can travel from the affluent southern suburbs to the Super Highway in 30 minutes flat. Oh and Aslam’s vehicle was blown up by suicide bombers just opposite Exit Six. Nice to see that someone’s grown a bougainvillea to cover the dumpster into which my father’s car crashed when his murderers opened fire. 
Briefly, I consider becoming a tour guide through the madness of this city. A colleague in London informs me that ex-IRA (Irish Republican Army) gunmen do something similar in Belfast, giving guided tours of the Falls and Shankill roads, and getting tourists discounts in the same pubs where terrorists sipped pints of Guinness and planned unthinkable atrocities. I even come up with a catchy name for the business:  ‘Omar’s Terrorism Tours.’ FML, as my son would say.  
And then, around the same time, two things happen that change my perspective. In the months after Aslam’s death, for reasons that remain unfathomable to me, my first book, that had started as a random personal attempt at catharsis, is read by more and more people. It acquires commercial and critical acclaim and is soon followed by another. And then another. And another. It transforms me into something I had never imagined becoming: a chronicler of this mad, dystopian, Alice in Wonderland place called Pakistan.
And, further stretching the bounds of credulity, my mother and I finally get justice. After an interlude of 17 years, involving so many political machinations that they would have prompted Machiavelli to write a sequel to The Prince, and despite the best efforts of a sociopath who lived in London and controlled Karachi via satellite phone for three decades, my father’s murderer finally hangs for his crimes.  
Centuries of evolution in religion, philosophy and the construct of society have established this belief that it is wrong to desire a man’s death. But I have developed a slightly different philosophy after 17 years of simultaneously being a victim and a law enforcer. I believe that at heart, despite what we say, we are still a tribal people. When people, evil people, hurt us, when they kill our loved ones, when they subvert the law with impunity for decades, when they threaten to extinguish all hope, we hanker for revenge. Thus, when justice finally takes its course, no matter how barbaric it may appear, you cannot deny that it is cleansing, liberating and healing.  
After four-and-a-half decades of living on this planet, I still don’t understand this place I call home. I don’t understand how it has brought moments of such pure joy in my life, and such mind-boggling pain. I cannot comprehend how injustice can permeate throughout a society so flagrantly, and how, at the same time, unbelievable heroism can be an everyday occurrence here. By any objective, logic based metric, this place should either not exist, or be the centre of a conflagration so immense that it would make Dante’s Inferno sound like a Sunday walk in the park. Yet, people survive. Some even thrive.  People fall in love, raise families, play cricket with eccentric friends on the weekends, and just live life like in any other part of the world. 
I certainly have.

Two things are at work here. First, they want to present Gen Munir as a scary Islamist with a nuclear arsenal. This portrayal is largely shaped to trigger the attention of western powers. 
Secondly, there is also the possibility that these analysts clearly aren’t aware that there is nothing called ‘Islamist nationalism.’ Either way, theirs is a rather ignorant portrayal. 
‘Islamism’ is opposed to the whole concept of nationalism. According to prominent Islamist ideologists such as Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb and Abul A’la Maududi, nationalism was a European construct and is inherently secular and bound by geography. Islamists argue that Islam’s ‘universalist’ vision is at odds with this equation. 
Nationalism indeed is a European concept. Therefore, for instance, Maududi’s concept of hakumat-i-ilahi [God’s rule/regime] was not about nationalism or a nation state. It was about an Islamist state ruled by a vanguard of ‘pious men’ who were to expand it. Ironically, though, the idea of the state as we know it today and as applied by the purveyors of Islamism is also a European construct.  

Pakistan’s ideological evolution, from Muslim nationalism to Islamic nationalism, has often been misunderstood. Now, the state is quietly reforming its ideological identity — one that is distinct from both secularism and Islamism

Nevertheless, both mainstr­eam and militant Islamists detest nationalism. But mainstream Islamists often enter politics to get seats in parliaments from where they strive to achieve their goals without having to resort to violence. They treat this as a temporary arrangement, though, which is to be held till Muslim polities and politics are ‘Islamised’ enough to embrace wider Islamist goals. 
But most experiments of this nature failed in various Muslim-majority nation states because, eventually, the nationalist impulse and the inherently secular make-up of the idea of the nation state clashed with the ambitions of the Islamists. 
Pakistan, a nation state, defines itself as an ‘Islamic Republic’ but one that was founded on ‘Muslim nationalism.’ Muslim nationalism seeks to advance the interests and aspirations of Muslims through nationalistic frameworks. It treats Islam as a ‘guiding force’ — not a political blueprint.
 
 

However, in the 1970s, the core of Pakistani nationalism began to move from Muslim nationalism towards ‘Islamic nationalism.’ Islamic nationalism retains many aspects of Muslim nationalism but is slightly more open towards co-opting certain theocratic elements of Islamism. 
Islamic nationalism’s immediate outcome in Pakistan was ‘Islamic republicanism.’ Islamic republicanism in Pakistan’s context meant a middle ground between a theocratic state and a secular republic. It encourages a democratic form of government, a democratically agreed cons­titution, and a mixture of secular and ‘Islamic’ laws. 
It treats Islam as an identity marker, and constitutionally, guarantees religious freedoms to non-Muslim citizens. It also provides enough room for entirely secular activities — as long as they do not contradict the way the constitution has defined Islam. 
The transition from Muslim nationalism to Islamic nationalism/republicanism has not been a smooth one, though. The latter was almost immediately seized by civilian-political and state actors as a tool to portray their political manoeuvres as ‘divinely-ordained.’ The appetite of the constitution to allow the co-option of more and more Islamist notions of law and morality was expanded. 
Consequently, Islamic nation­alism’s evolution was thrown into disarray. Pakistan came close to becoming an outright ‘theodemocracy’, or a blend of the principles of traditional republican democracy and theocratic rule. To some, it did become that. 
From the late 1980s onwards, the parliamentary route was rejected by most later-day Islamists and more militant and violent means were adopted by them. Mainstream Islamists, though, became desperate to sustain the route to theodemocracy that was becoming extremely bumpy. 
 


This desperation in them is still present. This means they sense that a change is afoot. And it is. The violence and confusion that the creeping theodemocracy unleashed in society began to threaten the state itself.
Gradually, the state (dominated by the powerful military establishment) is trying to reshape Islamic nationalism, and the government is following suit. Understandably, it is going to be a slow but prudent process.
The idea now is to position Pakistan’s Islamic nationalism/republicanism in opposition to contemporary Hindu nationalism in India, which is viewed as being regressive, violent and racist. What is also afoot is a quiet tweaking in this respect of rhetoric, textbooks and the constitution.
Some simple examples in this regard are constitutional bans on child marriage, the reintroduction in textbooks of a 1947 speech by the country’s founder that was expunged from the curriculum in 1977 for being ‘too secular’, etc. 
 
 

This is being done to refigure Islamic nationalism as a tolerant, inclusive and ‘balanced’ idea that is in tune with 21st century requirements, but also one that gives the state an overwhelming monopoly on violence against those perceived to be threatening the state. 
Gen Munir is not an Islamist nationalist. The term is inherently contradictory, as discussed above. One might say he’s an Islamic nationalist, but one whose nationalism is being informed by the reshaped version of Islamic nationalism, which is flexible, as opposed to what it became in the 1980s. 
During the country’s recent war with India, in which Pakistan downed multiple Indian fighter jets, the word ‘jihad’ was only sparingly used. The chant of “Allah-o-Akbar” [God is great], though, was common, as it has always been, even among the most liberal Pakistanis. It is entirely rhetorical and doesn’t carry any shadowy agenda. It’s more of a cultural chant than a declaration of any questionable intent, unless one was a violent, anti-state Islamist militant. 
The changing world order and Pakistan’s increasing importance in the region is compelling the state to constantly tweak the country’s Islamic nationalism. It is now well understood that the nationalism that began to mutate into something quite problematic in the 1980s is at odds with how the state has begun to see itself now.

Adam Abro told the police that he murdered his granddaughter, Fahmida Abro, “for honour” when she returned home after staying away for many days. The family is a resident of Adam Abro village, which is named after the elder and situated in the Fateh Abad union council.
The area police went to his home and took the woman’s body into their custody for a post-mortem examination. They said the suspect used a knife to slit her throat.
 
 

Fazil Rahu DSP Abdul Rahim Khaskheli told the media that circumstantial evidence suggested some other persons might also be involved in the murder. He said Abro surrendered before the Tarai police, who shifted him to the Model police station from where he was to be handed over to the Kario Ghanwer police for the registration of the murder case.
Residents of the village told the media that the woman had left her home to contract a freewill marriage with a man who lived in the same neighbourhood but he deceived her. She returned to her parents’ home in the early hours of Friday and was killed hours later, they added.
Her body was handed over to the heirs after legal formalities.

• CM Gulbar says region lacks funds to tackle flood damage
• Seven districts affected; Diamer worst hit by daily flash floods
• Villagers flee Rajanpur, Bhakkar, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as low-lying districts in Punjab submerged
GILGIT / LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Gilgit-Balti­stan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Saturday appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7 billion in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters that have caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.
Speaking at a press conference at the CM House in Gilgit, the chief minister said the GB government lacks the financial capacity to handle the unprecedented disasters.
CM Khan was accompanied by GB Home Minister Shams Lone, GB Assembly member Jamil Ahmed, Special Assi­stant on Infor­mation Eman Shah and Special Assistant on GB Disaster Management Auth­ority Muhammad Ali Quaid.
He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.
He said that so far, 10 fatalities and four injuries have been reported. Seven deaths were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.
The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.
He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.
“I appeal to the prime minister of Pakistan to immediately release at least Rs7bn to restore roads, electricity, water channels and to undertake other essential relief efforts,” the chief minister said and requested the premier to visit the region.
He recalled that the federal government provided Rs3bn during the 2022 floods, but criticised the previous GB administration for misusing the funds, with the exception of a model village established for flood victims in Ghizer’s Bubor area.
“This year’s disasters are beyond our resources. I urge the federal government to help the people of GB,” he added, while also appealing to non-governmental and international organisations for support. A formal request has been sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said.
Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which was blocked at Chilas on Saturday, was reopened for traffic on Sunday. However, flash flood events continued to be reported across GB.
In Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat, a flash flood swept away over 200 goats, sheep and surrounding greenery. Rescue 1122 reported multiple flash floods in the Shigar district on Saturday, affecting crops and infrastructure in Qaimabad Tisar, Chatron and Garam Chashma.
 
 

Residents said flash floods disrupted road access, mobile networks and electricity. In Kondus village of Ghanche district, a devastating landslide destroyed over 50 homes. Survivors are in dire need of shelter, food, medical care and internet access.
Flood-affected communities in Diamer and elsewhere are facing severe shortages of clean drinking water and essential supplies.
Punjab grapples with flooding
Meanwhile, thousands of residents across several districts in Punjab were displaced on Saturday as widespread flooding inundated low-lying areas. In some regions, such as Rojhan tehsil of Rajanpur, residents resorted to hiring private boats after failing to receive government assistance.
Several villagers in Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan and Muzaffargarh also had to leave due to a medium-level flood. All their crops were damaged due to the flood, and their houses were also surrounded by water.
The hundreds of people living in the catchment areas of the rivers Sindh and Chenab also had to migrate on their own, along with their cattle, struggling to find fodder and shelter. They protested the government’s lack of relief efforts.
 
 

In Layyah, the third flood wave in the Indus River raised water levels to 450,000 cusecs. A protective embankment near the under-construction Taunsa Bridge collapsed, submerging adjacent villages and farmlands. Rescue machinery, including a multimillion-rupee excavator, was at risk of being lost.
Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Chaudhry Ashfaq told Dawn that the situation was under control and that the excavator would be recovered once the water receded. Relief camps have been set up in Karor tehsil of Layyah at several locations.
Meanwhile, Dera Ghazi Khan Deputy Com­missioner Usman Khalid said water levels were expected to remain stable by evening and noted that seven relief camps had been established in Taunsa. He confirmed that no mass evacuations had occurred yet.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb visited flood-hit areas in Pindi Bhattian and Hafizabad, where dozens of villages were submerged due to heavy rains. She met with residents, announced one-month rations for affected families and inspected medical and livestock camps.
She said a survey had been conducted to assess flood damage and pledged to provide financial assistance in a transparent manner. Emergency measures have been implemented in affected areas, with residents advised to relocate from dilapidated structures.
Earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab issued flood warnings for the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and their tributaries, anticipating rising water levels from July 28 to 31.
Punjab’s Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javed directed local officials and departments, including agriculture, irrigation, health, livestock and transport, to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency arrangements, including food, shelter and clean water, were in place.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia urged the public to follow safety advisories and cooperate with authorities during emergency evacuations. He assured that the government would provide full support to both people and their livestock.

Often what you watch affects you badly and scars your soul.
One such image is that of a woman surrounded by about a dozen men being escorted away from the SUV in which she was presumably brought to the rocky wilderness. A video recording shows her walking a few steps with amazing calm and poise — her back is towards the men — and then she stops.
Next a man raises a pistol, points it towards the back of her chador-draped head and fires several shots. Before collapsing under a hail of bullets, Bano Satakzai appeared to express no fear, no anxiety, no emotion; offered no reaction. Whether it was outright resignation at her fate, defiance or stoicism is difficult to say.
The incident happened several weeks ago in Degari, Balochistan, we are told, and only became public when the men who’d brought her there for a ‘karo kari’ (‘honour’ killing) posted a horrific video of her murder on social media. A man was also said to have been killed at the same spot, but only the woman’s murder was captured clearly on camera. Their crime was initially said to be a marriage of choice, invoking the family and tribe’s wrath.

Pakistan’s ‘vigour’ in prosecuting cases of crimes against women is another story.

But then, the Balochistan chief minister criticised the media and social media users for not doing proper ‘investigative journalism’ as the couple were not married. In fact, a tribal chief or jirga had found them guilty of having an extramarital affair and sentenced them to death. Despite this ‘clarification’, gratefully, Sarfaraz Bugti hastened to add nobody had the right to take their lives and he stood with the victims and would ensure justice was served.
 
 

While nobody said who took the man’s life, it was emphasised that the woman was killed by her own brother because she had dishonoured the family. Belatedly, the Balochistan government says it arrested 11 men involved but, given the conviction rate in crimes against women, one can be sure once media attention shifts, the matter could be brushed under the carpet as has happened many times in the past.
The killers made sure that the woman’s execution was recorded and shared later on social media. The man was killed too but the focus on the woman being killed seemed designed to serve as a warning to other women to never ‘step out of line’.
Yes, it all makes sense in the beautiful world we have created, where patriarchy reigns supreme. Crimes against women are by no means restricted only to our society; they are a worldwide phenomenon. However, Pakistan’s ‘vigour’ in prosecuting such cases is another story.
In Pakistan, the conviction rate for those prosecuted for ‘honour’ killings and rape, besides other gender-based cases of violence, stands at 0.5 per cent. Yes, I will repeat: half a per cent, which, in other words, means that 99.5pc of those perpetrating violence against women get away scot-free. Legislation and induction of women police officers to investigate/ prosecute such crimes is yet to show in the statistics. This percentage in this instance is from the over 32,000 recorded, registered cases in 2024. It’s safe to assume many more cases aren’t even reported or registered.
The truth is that even in the West, women are battered, even killed. They are known not to receive protection when their own partner, for example, is the transgressor. Institutional bias is often evidenced in such cases where women under threat are either not believed or are ignored and the authorities don’t do enough to prevent domestic violence, even if they spring into action after violent incidents.
In our case, the vulnerability of women is exacerbated by the utter and complete lack of interest of the law-enforcement machinery in not just stopping violent men, despite being alerted in instances, but also by the fact that after a crime is committed, the investigation and prosecution do not seem to be a priority either.
The result is whether it was Qandeel Baloch murdered by her own brother, who had no qualms living off his sister’s income but felt she dishonoured the family by becoming a bold social media star a few years ago; or the most recent blood-curdling torture and consequent death of a 19-year old woman, whose psychopath husband did unmentionable things to her; or earlier this year the brother who killed his two sisters because they’d married of their own choice — all victims are women.
Each instance is one of control and of repudiation of a woman as an equal, with rights identical to men. The world has moved in varying degrees to acknowledge legally and societally the equality of women, despite resistance from those long conditioned by patriarchy. We seem far behind as we speak.
Each report of gender-based violence or even discrimination pushes me deeper into despair. If half of our society is not prepared to relinquish control over the remaining half and embrace it as a diverse equal, imagine the collective intellectual and decision-making deficit that is created. This system has to be dismantled, torn down before we can build something better, more equal, fairer and saner.
 
 

I am reminded of John Lennon’s words: “You may say I am dreamer, but I am not the only one.” I wish I had Lennon’s optimism in saying I am not the only one, and that an equal, fairer society is indeed possible. And that men could be reformed to appreciate that patriarchy is a major impediment to our development and that women’s equality is a matter of right not something that owes to a man’s benevolence.
But every day we furnish evidence we are moving further and further away from being more inclusive. We appear determined to condemn ourselves to torment such as the one that the images from Degari brought us. Where can we realistically go from here?

At the same time, imports from the region surged more than fourfold, deepening the trade imbalance.
According to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, exports to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan fell to $197.06 million in FY25 from $288.23m in FY24.
In contrast, imports from these countries jumped by 411pc to $245.09m, compared to just $47.94m in the previous year, with the bulk originating from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
Despite multiple high-level visits and the operationalisation of transit trade agreements — particularly with Uzbekistan — trade volumes remain below potential. Uzbekistan has begun utilising its transit agreement with Pakistan, and Tajikistan last year imported three truckloads of potatoes under a similar arrangement.

Exports to five Central Asian states drop 32pc, while imports soar over fourfold

However, these developments have yet to translate into a significant boost in exports.
Country-wise data shows that Kazakhstan remained Pakistan’s top export destination among the CACs, but exports dropped sharply by 47.12pc to $97.96m in FY25, from $185.25m the previous year. Meanwhile, imports from Kazakhstan rose to an all-time high of $129.63m, up from just $0.677m in FY24.
Exports to Uzbekistan declined by 18.17pc to $63.65m from $77.79m a year earlier, while imports surged 177.6pc to $79.23m from $28.54m. Similarly, exports to Kyrgyzstan dropped by 58.26pc to $3.99m in FY25, compared to $9.56m last year, while imports rose modestly to $0.571m from $0.357m.
Pakistan’s exports to Turkmenistan increased by 42.73pc, reaching $1.67m from $1.17m, whereas imports grew by 35.48pc to $16.57m from $12.23m. In contrast to the broader trend, exports to Tajikistan more than doubled, rising by 106pc to $29.79m in FY25, up from $14.46m. However, imports from Tajikistan also jumped by 211pc to $19.09m from $6.13m a year earlier.
Pakistan’s annual trade with the CACs, routed mostly via Afghanistan, ranges between $400m and $500m — a fraction of its overall trade volume. The figures highlight the persistent underperformance of Pakistan’s trade with Central Asia, despite diplomatic and logistical efforts to strengthen economic ties.

• Governor bemoans Centre’s uplift measures focused on Punjab
PESHAWAR: A jirga organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital on Saturday rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga.
The gathering, which was attended by almost all major political parties, was held at Bacha Khan Markaz, followed by a press conference in which a 28-point declaration was read out by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar.
The jirga demanded an end to terrorism and the restoration of constitutional rights, as well as the protection of Pashtun rights. The declaration emphasised the need for a durable peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas through a political leadership-driven jirga to engage in “serious negotiations” with the military establishment. It demanded the full implementation of the 18th Amendment, an end to proxy wars, and the early restoration of the NFC Award.
 






It urged the government to eliminate all terrorist outfits in the province without any discrimination while also rejecting all forms of violence, including military operations. It agreed on the establishment of a peace process led by the political leadership to address the root causes of militancy. It also demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.
The jirga also demanded concrete steps to address enforced disappearances, internally-displaced persons’ problems, and the reconstruction of infrastructure damaged during multiple military operations. It said all missing persons should be produced in relevant courts to provide justice to the affected families. It further called for an end to proxy wars, neutral stance in international conflicts, and the strengthening of diplomatic relations with the neighbouring countries.
The jirga asked for the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) and the rollback of the Action in Aid of Civil Power 2019 to stop injustices. It also sought funds and facilities for the ex-Fata region as per the promises made by the federal government.
The gathering was attended by representatives from the ANP, the PML-N, the PPP, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, the Jamaat-i-Islami, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Qaumi Watan Party, the National Democratic Movement, the Pashtunkhwa Awami National Party, and the Mazdoor Kisan Party.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi told journalists at KP House in Islamabad that the Fata merger could not be rolled back without a constitutional amendment and sought funds for the region promised at the time of its integration. He also demanded that a tribal jirga be constituted to resolve the issues faced by these areas. The governor said that the situation in the province was “ser­­iously dangerous” as people were being kidnapped for ransom in broad-daylight.
He also criticised the federal government and said that its focus was only on the development of Punjab, saying that the KP youth had been ignored by the  government in its projects . He said the province lacked proper playgrounds, as a result of which the PSL matches could not be held in KP. He also claimed that the PTI founder, Imran Khan, would not come out of jail and his sons would not travel to Pakistan.
The jirga participants warned that they would march on Isla­mabad if their demands were not met.

While it has reduced the presence of militant networks within the country, these groups have not been entirely eliminated. Though no longer thriving, they remain active and continue to damage Pakistan’s international image.
When international pressure on Pakistan intensified in 2018, particularly through the FATF, the state establishment decided to restrict militant networks that were active in Indian-held Kashmir and the sectarian domains. A key component of this effort was the launch of rehabilitation and mainstreaming programmes targeting these groups.
For the reintegration of the Lashkar-e-Taiba/ Jamaatud Dawa and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) fighters, the establishment launched a multipronged policy. For the LeT/JuD, the creation of a political wing was a key component of this strategy. Despite reports of billions of rupees being spent on rehabilitation programmes, there is little transparency about who implemented them and what the outcomes were.
In this shifting landscape, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan has emerged as a replacement for the banned sectarian group Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, which, although still present, has largely lost its influence even within Deobandi madressahs, although it retains some residual potential. The TLP not only absorbed the SSP’s sectarian agenda but also adopted the anti-Ahmadi narrative of the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat movements, expanding and intensifying the reach of both.

Pakistan’s militancy landscape is changing rapidly, but credible initiatives are needed.

While the TLP has not engaged in violence to the extent of earlier anti-Shia militant groups, it presents a more insidious threat. It has succeeded in internalising hate within society, influencing public discourse and unsettling institutional mindsets across the country.
 
 

The LeT/JuD proposed a shift towards mainstream politics and attempted to enter electoral politics under various names, the most recent being the Markazi Muslim League (MML). The core idea behind this move was to capture the political space in Punjab that the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) had vacated, especially after it lost favour with the establishment.
Another idea floated during this time was to absorb the SSP into the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, but it did not work, as the SSP was divided and its leadership was unwilling to surrender their perks and privileges. Such ideas had little potential to work, as the major religious parties were also concerned about their image if the bulk of militants joined their parties.
 
 

While Pakistani authorities framed this shift as a strategy for the political mainstreaming of LeT/JuD and JeM, Indian policy circles and media interpreted it differently. They argued that this transformation aimed to ‘secularise’ militancy in Kashmir and pointed to the formation of The Resistance Front (TRF), allegedly linked to LeT, as part of this narrative.
It is unclear how far the militant credentials of LeT and JeM have been secularised. However, the shift in Pakistan’s policy towards militant groups has reduced the appeal and presence of Kashmiri militant outfits, including Hizbul Mujahideen, once a major jihadist group affiliated with the JI.
While this transformation was unfolding among Kashmir-based militant groups, two international terrorist organisations, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent and the Islamic State (IS), were competing to extend their networks in the region, particularly in India-held Kashmir.
Ironically, this transformation brought strategic advantages to both sides. For India, it curtailed the infiltration of global jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and IS into Kashmir. For Pakistan, it made it increasingly difficult for India to prove direct state links to militancy, thereby improving Pakistan’s international image. The recent US sanctions on the TRF appear to be a balancing act. Whether symbolic or genuine, these sanctions are unlikely to harm Pakistan’s interests significantly.
Internally, however, the experiment of managing militancy through sanctions and soft reintegration has produced mixed results. For instance, the PTI-led government, in coordination with the establishment, attempted a similar approach with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but it did not succeed. The recent wave of terrorism in KP is a result of that policy, which backfired.
 
 

As Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape evolves, the establishment has begun reflecting on its strategy towards militant groups. There appears to be a growing consensus within the state to further restrict the operational space available to these groups.
The JeM, in particular, is seen as a potential risk, as some of its factions and commanders defected to Al Qaeda and the TTP after 2004. Although its infrastructure has already been significantly weakened, it continues to pose a threat to internal security. The state has adopted a different approach towards the JeM; it does not have the potential to be converted into a political party, as it lacks the extensive networks of groups like the LeT/JuD. Nor does it have the vision or capacity to adopt a new path. It has been kept in the domain of charity to allow limited functions, driven by the fear that a complete dismantling would create internal security problems, pushing its fighters towards joining anti-Pakistan terrorist groups.
The LeT/JuD are also undergoing a phase of internal re-evaluation. The group appears divi­d­­ed: some elements advocate continued militancy, while others favour disengagement from armed struggle.
Pakistan’s militancy landscape is changing rapidly, but credible initiatives are needed. While the establishment has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards the TTP, Islamic State-Khorasan and Baloch insurgent groups, it must apply a similar approach to other forms of radical and militant outfits. Perhaps no reintegration plan is needed at this stage, as the potential of these groups has been exposed, and there would be little chance of backlash if the establishment were to disallow them from operating inside the country in any form.
When the MML takes to the streets to protest against Indian aggression, and TLP threatens judges or influences court decisions, while state institutions remain silent, it gives the impression to the world that the state either cannot deal with such groups or is not averse to allowing them space for survival. In such a scenario, the world also casts doubt on the state’s potential as a reliable partner in broader geopolitical and geo-economic designs.

The two sides appear ready to recalibrate their economic and strategic ties after years of diplomatic chill and disengagement.
The meeting between the top diplomats of the two countries is being widely interpreted as a formal culmination of a discreet thaw in bilateral ties — set in motion by the lunch President Donald Trump recently hosted for Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House. It would not be wrong to say that Mr Trump’s gesture helped lay the groundwork for the resumption of high-level diplomatic momentum between the two nations.
At Friday’s meeting, the two sides are said to have discussed several issues — trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation, critical minerals and mining, and the recent Pakistan-India clash, which the US president takes credit for stopping.
Indeed, Pakistan appears keen on securing continued US engagement in South Asia, particularly for help in the resolution of the long-standing Kashmir dispute. Yet, it is clear from Mr Dar’s remarks, following his meeting with Mr Rubio, that Islamabad is now prioritising a more durable economic partnership with Washington.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI and counterterrorism cooperation,” he posted on X. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, he revealed that a trade deal over the steep 29pc reciprocal tariffs imposed on Pakistan as part of President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs was “very close”.
“It’s not going to be months, not even weeks — I would say [just] days,” he said. Mr Rubio, for his part, said the discussions focused on expanding bilateral trade and advancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector — an area of growing strategic interest for both sides.
The US remains Pakistan’s single largest export destination, and American firms hold the biggest portfolio of fixed investment across key sectors of the country’s economy, underscoring the long-term strategic importance of enhanced trade and investment ties between the two nations.
That the latter appear willing to reset their ties around economic cooperation is encouraging and marks a departure from the days of security-centric engagements. It should lay the foundation for an enduring partnership. It must also be emphasised that the ongoing discussions over higher reciprocal tariffs afford policymakers a unique opportunity to build the future trajectory of bilateral ties on the basis of broader economic cooperation.
A partnership built on the long-term economic interests of the two countries should go a long way in deepening bilateral cooperation in other important areas, such as counterterrorism, as well.

• Barrister Gohar urges end to political exclusion
ISLAMABAD: As many as five Senators have submitted their affidavits to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, indicating their intention to officially join the party.
However, a sixth Senator — Murad Saeed — remains “missing.” According to party sources, his intimation regarding joining PTI may be received electronically.
PTI’s Information Secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking to Dawn, said that five Senators who were recently elected as independent candidates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have handed over their affidavits to Mr. Gohar.
“The affidavits will be submitted to the Election Commission of Pakis­tan (ECP) on Monday (tomorrow),” he said.
The Senators who submitted affidavits to join PTI include Azam Swati, Faisal Javed, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, and Robina Naz.
However, it is pertinent to mention that PTI stalwart Murad Saeed — who secured the highest number of votes on general seats — has not yet submitted his affidavit to Mr. Gohar.
According to party sources, the government is actively attempting to arrest Murad Saeed, who has been in hiding for a considerable period. As a result, his affidavit might be delayed or submitted electronically.
When contacted, Azam Swati told Dawn that he and the other candidates had made every effort to obtain official PTI tickets but were denied.
“In my case, my nomination papers were rejected multiple times and were only accepted following a court order, which remarked: ‘If Azam Swati cannot contest the election on a technocrat seat, then who can?’ As we did not have party tickets, we formed a group of six independent candidates and went on to win the election,” he said.
In response to another question, Mr Swati confirmed that he and the other four Senators had submitted their affidavits to Barrister Gohar on July 23.
He expressed confidence that the affidavits would be submitted to the ECP, as rules require Senators to formally join a political party within three days of the election.
Hammad Azhar to contest by-polls
Meanwhile, PTI plans to nominate the party’s former Punjab president, Hammad Azhar, to contest the by-election from NA-129— the constituency where his late father, Mian Muhammad Azhar, was elected in the February 8, 2024, general elections.
It is worth mentioning that Hammad Azhar was also elected as an MNA from the same constituency in the 2018 general elections.
Last year, Mian Azhar had contested the election because Hammad Azhar failed to submit his nomination papers.
At the time, the younger Azhar had been declared an absconder, although he later attended his father’s funeral.
‘Not a good omen’
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has stated that sidelining a major political party is not a good omen for the country, stressing that every stakeholder must play a role in upholding democracy.
He made these remarks on Friday after visiting Hammad Azhar’s residence to offer condolences on the passing of his father, Mian Azhar, former Punjab governor and PTI MNA.
While acknowledging that the dialogue process has not progressed, Mr Gohar said that people need to put aside their unwarranted egos. He lamented that PTI was first accused of rec­eiving foreign funding and later blamed for the country’s current political instability. He made it clear that PTI has never attempted to create chaos or provoke confrontations in politics.

Police produced Gul Jan Bibi before Judge Muhammad Ali Mobeen of the ATC-I after the expiry of her two-day physical remand and the investigation officer informed the court that she was not required for further investigation.
After the initial arguments from both sides, the jud­ge sent the woman on judicial remand.
Gul Jan Bibi was arrested after her video statement went viral, in which she defended the killing of her daughter, Bano Bibi, and a man in the name of ‘honour’ in Dagari, on the outskirts of Quetta.
“They were killed according to the Baloch traditions and customs and we have not committed any sin by killing them,” Gul Jan Bibi said about the incident that shook the nation after videos of a group of men shooting the victims surfaced online earlier this month.
So far, around 15 people, including the tribal chief of Satakzai tribe, Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai, have been arrested. However, the prime accused, Jalal Satakzai, who allegedly opened fire and killed his elder sister, and the man, could not be arrested.
Protest
Meanwhile, human rights organisations and civil society staged a protest on Saturday to condemn the killings.
The protest was jointly organised by the Women Action Forum, National Commission on Human Rights, HRCP and Bol Utho Group.
A large number of human rights activists and members of civil society gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club. They took out a rally led by rights activists Prof Farkhanda Auran­g­zeb, Huma Fouladi, Seema Batool, Hameeda Noor and others.
The protesters condemned the incident and said honour killings were an intolerable act.
They demanded that all those involved in this crime be brought to justice.
“Nobody has the right to take law in his hand and kill people in the name of so-called honour,” Ms Aurangzeb said.
The protesters urged the government to protect women from such atrocities.

FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. He spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had drawn a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”. Furthermore, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, following the due process of law. “When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
FM Dar’s remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being “idiotic”.
Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: “Yesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan’s case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.”
He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.
“Our government’s stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release is clear and unequivocal.”
 






Responding to Dar’s comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said: “Sorry but this is idiotic! ‘Due process’ does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied & it was all false. That’s called a miscarriage of justice not what’s ‘due’.”
 






Dar “appeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia’s case yesterday by acting like she got ‘due process’ when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan”, he said in a separate post on X.
 






Speaking to Dawn.com, Smith said: “As you may have seen from the deputy PM’s statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case — saying her case is a result of ‘due process of law’ in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.
“He goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, which should be done through the courts.”
Smith said that in his opinion, “I suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia’s case, I tried to do that through the clemency process with Biden too.”
He said that FM Dar’s analogy was “unwise as well as misplaced”.
On the PTI founder’s incarceration and legal troubles, he said: “I suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‘due process of law’ in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‘due process’.”
He added that FM Dar should not talk about Dr Aafia’s case in the context of Imran’s cases.
“In every instance, Pakistan’s officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,” Aafia’s lawyer added.
He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia’s release.
Speaking on the circumstances of her trial, Smith said: “The defence brought no witnesses to New York, not one.
“The prosecution brought the people they wanted — soldiers who all tried unsuccessfully to tell the same story, and an Afghan interpreter who was promised US residency and given a substantial amount of money.”
He said that the physical evidence solidly disproved the prosecution’s theory, even then, but before trial, the defence did not locate the videotape that proved beyond argument that the holes in the wall were not from Dr Aafia shooting, since they were from earlier that day.
“I have promised to file her appeal in New York in the next week or ten days,” Smith said.
A day ago, PM Shehbaz had assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.
On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.
However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.
In February, the IHC was told that the proposal to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.
Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had requested that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.
In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.
“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”
Consequently, the US State Department declined to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p><small>2025-07-27 03:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/68856a416fe42.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926814/un-conference-eyes-solution-to-gaza-deadlock' target='_blank'><strong>UN conference eyes solution to Gaza deadlock</strong></a><br><p>• New York meeting to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia next week
• Israel and US to skip conference; 11 more Palestinians killed
• UK plans to airdrop aid, evacuate injured children from Gaza
UNITED NATIONS: Fired by France’s imminent recognition of Palestinian statehood, UN members meet next week to breathe life into the push for a two-state solution as Israel, expected to be absent, presses its war in Gaza.
Days before the July 28-30 conference on fostering Israeli and Palestinian states living peacefully side-by-side to be co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would formally recognise the State of Palestine in September.
His declaration “will breathe new life into a conference that seemed destined to irrelevance,” said Richard Gowan, an analyst at International Crisis Group.
“Macron’s announcement changes the game. Other participants will be scrabbling to decide if they should also declare an intent to recognise Palestine.” According to an AFP database, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states —including France — now recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed by the Palestinian leadership in exile in 1988.
The New York conference is a response to the crisis, with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa and several dozen ministers from around the world expected to attend.
‘No alternative’
The meeting comes as a two-state solution is “more threatened than it has ever been (but) even more necessary than before, because we see very clearly that there is no alternative,” said a French diplomatic source.
Beyond facilitating conditions for recognition of a Palestinian state, the meeting will have three other focuses — reform of the Palestinian Authority, disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from Palestinian public life, and normalisation of relations with Israel by Arab states that have not yet done so.
Ahead of the conference, Britain said it would not recognise a Palestinian state unilaterally and would wait for “a wider plan” for peace in the region.
Macron has also not yet persuaded Germany to follow suit and recognise a Palestinian state in the short term.
The conference “offers a unique opportunity to transform international law and the international consensus into an achievable plan and to demonstrate resolve to end the occupation and conflict once and for all, for the benefit of all peoples,” said the Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour.
Israel and the United States will not take part in the meeting.
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli operations killed 11 people including four Palestinians in the Al-Rimal neighbourhood. Another person was killed “after Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for humanitarian aid” northwest of Gaza City, the agency said.
Witnesses said several thousand people had gathered in the area for aid. Another man was killed by a drone strike near the southern city of Khan Yunis, while one was killed by artillery fire in the Al-Bureij camp, the civil defence said.
UK to airdrop Gaza aid
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday spoke to his French and German counterparts and outlined UK plans to get aid to people in Gaza and evacuate sick and injured children, his office said.
“The prime minister set out how the UK will also be taking forward plans to work with partners such as Jordan to airdrop aid and evacuate children requiring medical assistance,” a statement said.
In a phone conversation, Starmer, Fre­nch President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza “which they agreed is appalling”.
“They all agreed it would be vital to ensure robust plans are in place to turn an urgently needed ceasefire into lasting peace,” according to a readout released by Downing Street.
Handala near Gaza shores
Meanwhile, the activist group Freedom Flotilla announced that its latest aid boat dispatched to Gaza was approaching the territory and planned to land there on Sunday morning in defiance of an Israeli blockade.
The vessel, named the Handala after a popular Palestinian cartoon character, was 194km from its destination, organisers said — closer to Gaza than its predecessor the Madleen was when it was intercepted in June.
Carrying 19 activists, including Swed­ish activist Greta Thunberg, as well as two journalists from different countries, the  Handala first set sail from Sicily on July 13 in a bid to break the  Israeli blockade on Gaza and deliver aid to its population. However, the Israeli navy said it would block the new vessel from reaching Palestine.

The premier was chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms in Islamabad on Saturday.
He directed the FBR to continue dialogue with the business community over tax compliance concerns, emphasising that any form of harassment will not be tolerated.
The government, he stated, remains committed to creating a facilitative environment for businesses across the country. The directive comes amid mounting tensions, as trade associations have announced a nationwide strike in response to budgetary tax measures aimed at documenting the retail sector and curbing tax evasion.
An official source told Dawn that the prime minister has directed senior FBR officials to ensure that no member of the business community is subjected to harassment. “We have to keep businesses running,” he stated, adding that any coercive actions against traders would be unacceptable. “We do not want to close businesses,” he said.
Mr Shehbaz further emphasised that the FBR should rely on digital surveillance rather than physical crackdowns to identify tax evaders. “Utilise technology to detect tax evasion and then issue recovery notices,” the prime minister instructed.
The FBR has deployed tax officials across 10 key sectors — including ghee, tobacco, and sugar — to monitor actual production and detect instan­ces of concealment. Section 40B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 authorises the FBR to station officers directly at business premises for this purpose.
To ensure transparency, FBR personnel are accompanied by representatives from the Intelligence Bureau and other relevant agencies.
Preliminary findings indicate that certain sectors have been deliberately underreporting production in order to evade taxes.
The prime minister has underscored the need for equitable tax contributions across all segments of the economy. Expressing concern over the narrow focus of current tax collection efforts — primarily targeting the manufacturing sector and salaried individuals — he termed the approach as unjust.
He directed that high-net-worth individuals, retailers, wholesalers, and other economic actors be brought under the tax net to ensure a broader and fairer revenue base.
“The tax collection process must be rational and efficient so that we reduce reliance on domestic taxation,” the premier stated, emphasising that every sector carries a responsibility to contribute its fair share to the national exchequer.
According to the tax official, the issues with traders are expected to be resolved by the coming Monday.
“We have addressed most concerns and reached an understanding,” the official stated, adding that the remaining issues will be settled during the final round of negotiations.

• Aleema claims jail authorities denied lawyers entry to plead Toshakhana case
ISLAMABAD: PTI founding chairman and ex-premier Imran Khan has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the rejection of his bail by lower courts.
On June 24, the Lahore High Court (LHC) denied post-arrest bail to the incarcerated PTI leader in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including an attack on the house of Lahore corps commander. Mr Khan had moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court denied bail to the former prime minister in these eight cases.
The petition, filed through senior counsel Salman Safdar on Saturday, claimed Mr Khan has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
However, at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Khan was in the custody of NAB. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible,” the petition argued.
The appeal was filed a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema, accused the Adiala jail authorities of trying to sabotage the case by confiscating documents required to submit the petition.
The fresh appeal contended the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister two years ago.
The present case is yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” Mr Khan in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment”.
The prosecution has no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged occurrence, the petition claimed.
After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” arrest from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, the petition contended, adding none of these complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.
At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan.
If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the petition questioned.
This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”.
The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.
Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, the petition pleaded.
It added the police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months after his bail applications were dismissed by an Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore on Aug 11, 2023.
Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”.
“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the petition said.
LHC decision
The petition claimed the LHC declined Mr Khan’s request for post-arrest bail by relying on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
The high court also failed to note the prosecution had been “consistently shifting its stance” by continually changing the case’s narrative.
“Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry.”
These contradictions clearly make a case for Mr Khan to be granted bail under Section 497(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The said section, which allows bail in non-bailable offences, states: “If it appears to such officer or Court … that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed [a non-bailable offence], but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall, pending such inquiry, be released on bail…”.
Legal team denied entry
Also on Saturday, Ms Aleema, the PTI founder’s sister, claimed his legal team was not allowed inside the Adiala Jail to attend the proceedings of the Toshakhana 2 case.
While talking to reporters outside the prison, Ms Aleema said she and the lawyers were waiting but neither was allowed to enter the prison.
“We were told that only one lawyer can go inside the jail but the lawyer asked how he would [plead the case] without his legal team,” Ms Aleema said.
She claimed the jail authorities violated the judge’s orders, who “time and again said the lawyers of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be allowed to enter”.
Ms Aleema said no one was listening to judges “because of the 26th Constitutional Amendment”.
She added her brother has already given a call to launch a protest campaign and raise a voice against the amendment.

According to Swat police, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of high-profile militants in the area. When law enforcement personnel moved in, the suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. All three militants were killed in the ensuing exchange.
Among the deceased was Ajmal alias Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad, wanted in at least nine terrorism-related cases. The second was identified as Matiullah alias Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, wanted in two cases.
The third, Rahimullah Rehmani alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah and a resident of Sheray, Nuristan, in Afghanistan, was also wanted in two separate terrorism cases.
Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan told reporters that search and strike operations would continue across the district.
He added that security had been intensified at all entry and exit points to prevent the infiltration of miscreants. “We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” he said.
Militant killed by own accomplices
In a separate incident in Kohat district, an alleged militant involved in an earlier attack on the Hangu DPO was killed on Friday night, reportedly by fire from his own group during a police operation.
 
 

The militant, identified as Shahzeb, had previously escaped after being injured during an attack on the Hangu DPO’s convoy last Saturday. DPO Khalid Khan and SHO Nabi Khan were injured in the attack. Shahzeb was later arrested near Naryab Dam within the Doaba police jurisdiction.
During interrogation, he revealed the presence of militant commander Umer alias Abu Bakr in the area. Acting on this intelligence, police from Doaba and Thall tehsils launched an operation towards Tora Warai, where they were again ambushed.
SHO Doaba Imranud Din, who was transferred from Kohat a few days ago, and his team engaged the militants in a two-hour gun battle. During the exchange, Shahzeb was fatally struck by a bullet allegedly fired by his accomplices.
Karak operation
In Karak, an alleged militant was killed during an exchange of fire with police in the Shah Slaim area on Saturday.
A police official said a team assisted by CTD commandos was dispatched after intelligence reports indicated that a group of militants was heading towards the Abbas Khattak area in Lakki Marwat district.
During a search operation in Shah Slaim, security forces encountered the group, resulting in a fierce gun battle.
“The gunfight continued for some time before the terrorists fled into difficult mountainous terrain,” he claimed.
During the subsequent search, police recovered the body of a militant identified as Fidaullah, a resident of Nagri.
“The cops also seized an assault rifle, two hand grenades, magazines and ammunition from the place and shifted the terrorist’s body to a nearby hospital,” the police official added.
The official said that the killed militant was involved in various sabotage activities, including the Friday’s militant attack in the Koh-i-Maidan area in which a police constable Saeed Nawaz was martyred.
He said that police also destroyed the hideouts of militants in a separate action.
“The police, with the help of CTD personnel, launched a search and strike operation against the gang of terrorists led by Sanaullah Jalali and Attaullah,” he maintained, claiming that the group has been involved in launching attacks on law enforcement personnel in the Karak district.
He said that, along with destroying safe havens in the mountains, the law enforcers also cut off the supply line of the militants.

The trial, held from July 7 to 9, resulted in the judgment by Justice Heather Williams DBE, who convicted Abrar Qureshi of libel over two defamatory videos of his popular ‘Gorakh Dhanda’ programme published online on November 1, 2021 via different social media platforms. 
PPP regional president and MLA Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin and his son Chaudhry Amar Yasin, an AJK cabinet member, had brought the case in the King’s Bench Division of the High Court, citing severe harm to their political and personal reputations. 
The videos featured Mr Qureshi’s interview with Chaudhry Muhammad Sabeel, a former employee of the elder Yasin, who levelled accusations of criminal misconduct, including blackmail, sexual abuse, torture, corruption, and abuse of public office. 

Abrar Qureshi ordered not to publish defamatory videos again, share court order on his social media accounts

The court concluded that Mr Qureshi had made no reasonable attempt to verify the allegations before broadcasting them to a large audience. 
In her 62-page ruling, a copy of which was seen by Dawn, Justice Williams noted that Mr Qureshi had abandoned his defences of truth and honest opinion on the first day of trial, leaving him unable to justify the defamatory publications under public interest protections 
She found that Mr Qureshi had “fallen well short of the standards expected of a responsible journalist,” particularly given the size and influence of his platform, which includes over 190,000 YouTube subscribers and 700,000 Facebook followers. 
The judge said his failure to present Yasin family’s version of events or conduct basic checks made the publication grossly irresponsible.
The judge observed that the allegations had caused “serious harm” to the claimants’ personal and professional standing, especially considering their public roles within Pakistan and the Kashmiri diaspora in the UK. The tone of authority, repetition, and lack of challenge in the videos had led many viewers to believe the accusations were true, she added. 
While acknowledging that the claimants may have overstated the extent of reputational harm during parts of their testimony, the court was satisfied that the legal threshold of serious harm had been crossed by a wide margin. 
“As a remedy, each claimant was awarded £130,000 in libel damages, including aggravated damages to reflect the distress and reputational damage caused. Additionally, the defendant was ordered to pay interest of £21,829 to each claimant and an interim payment of £65,000 towards legal costs by August 8.”
The court issued a permanent injunction restraining Mr Qureshi from republishing the defamatory material or anything similar and directed him to post a court-approved summary of the judgment across all his social media platforms within seven days, as per Section 12 of the UK Defamation Act 2013.
Legal experts say the ruling underscored the limits of free expression on digital platforms, particularly where reputations are damaged in foreign nations. It also highlighted the strength of UK libel law, even in a cross-jurisdictional and digital media context.
Speaking briefly in Muzaffarabad after the verdict, Mr Yasin said: “We welcome the judgment as a vindication of truth and accountability.”

Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated. As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
Three of the total suspects were present in the court of Magistrate Qamar Abbas Tarar today, according to a court order seen by Dawn.com.
The judge approved the investigation officer’s (IO) request for custody, stating: “… Three-day physical remand of the accused for said purpose is hereby granted. Accused persons be produced before the court on July 29.”
In another order from today, the judge approved the application to conduct the exhumation of the victim’s body and scheduled it for July 28 at 10am. The judge directed the Holy Family Hospital’s medical superintendent to depute a medical officer who would arrive at the graveyard for the exhumation and also order the Pirwadhai Police station house officer to designate a guard at the victim’s grave until the exhumation.
The Rawalpindi tehsil medical officer was also instructed to provide sanitary workers for the process.
Separately, the police added Sections 109 (abetment), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (murder) and 311  (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code to the FIR on Friday.
City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani also told Dawn.com that a 10-member team was formed to assist in the investigation.
He said the team included various senior police officials further and IT experts of Rawalpindi Police, who would ensure timely support and the provision of technical evidence to the investigation officer from various institutions.
Hamdani said that the team would also conduct raids to ensure the timely arrest of more suspects in the light of information obtained from those detained during the investigation.
The incident comes a few days after  police arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Degari area of Balochistan’s Quetta, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/262139145dd857f.jpg?r=214005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/trump-says-thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-hold-immediate-ceasefire-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Thailand and Cambodia agree to hold immediate ceasefire talks</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the leaders of Cambodia and Thailand had agreed to meet immediately to quickly work out a ceasefire, as he sought to broker peace after three days of fighting along their border left at least 33 people dead.
In a series of social media posts during a visit to Scotland, Trump said he had spoken to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, warning them that he would not make trade deals with either of their governments if the border conflict continued.
Following calls for restraint on both sides from Trump’s senior aides, he became directly involved on Saturday, speaking to each leader and saying he relayed messages back and forth.
“Just spoke to the prime minister of Cambodia relative to stopping the war with Thailand,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.
“I have just spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he said soon after in a new post. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate ceasefire and peace.
“I am now going to relay that message back to the prime minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both parties, [a] ceasefire, peace, and prosperity seems to be a natural”
 


“They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a ceasefire and, ultimately, peace!” Trump wrote later, saying both countries wanted to get back to the “Trading Table”.
He has sought to reach separate deals with dozens of countries in response to his announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on imports to the US.
“When all is done, and Peace is at hand, I look forward to concluding our Trading Agreements with both!” Trump said.
He offered no details on the ceasefire negotiations he said Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to hold.
The Thai and Cambodian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thailand and Cambodia clashed for a third day today, as the death toll from their bloodiest fighting in years rose to 33 and Phnom Penh called for an “immediate ceasefire”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into intense conflict involving jets, artillery, tanks and ground troops on Thursday, prompting the UN Security Council (UNSC) to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Friday.
“I am trying to simplify a complex situation! Many people are being killed in this war, but it very much reminds me of the conflict between Pakistan and India, which was brought to a successful halt,” Trump said.
Trump also indicated he would not move forward on trade deals with either nation until fighting has stopped.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said 13 people were now confirmed killed in the fighting, including eight civilians and five soldiers, with 71 people wounded.
In Thailand, the army said five soldiers were killed on Friday, taking the toll there to 20 — 14 civilians and six military.
The death toll across the two countries is now higher than the 28 killed in the last major round of fighting between 2008 and 2011.
Both sides reported a clash around 5am (3am PKT), with Cambodia accusing Thai forces of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into locations in Pursat province, which borders Thailand’s Trat province.
 
 

The fighting has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, with more than 35,000 driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After the closed meeting of the UNSC in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted a ceasefire.
“Cambodia asked for an immediate ceasefire — unconditionally — and we also call for the peaceful solution of the dispute,” he told reporters.
Border row
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said on Friday, before the UN meeting was held, that Bangkok was open to talks, possibly aided by Malaysia.
“We are ready, if Cambodia would like to settle this matter via diplomatic channels, bilaterally, or even through Malaysia, we are ready to do that. But so far we have not had any response,” Nikorndej told AFP.
Malaysia currently holds the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, of which Thailand and Cambodia are both members.
Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has warned that if the situation escalates, “it could develop into war”.
Both sides blamed each other for firing first, while Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket.
Cambodia has accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions.
At the UN, Cambodia’s envoy questioned Thailand’s assertion that his country, which is smaller and less militarily developed than its neighbour, had initiated the conflict.
“[The Security Council] called for both parties to [show] maximum restraint and resort to a diplomatic solution. That is what we are calling for as well,” said Chhea Keo.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours — both popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists — over their shared 800-kilometre border.
Dozens of kilometres in several areas are contested and fighting broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.
A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the matter for over a decade, but the current crisis erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a new clash.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615924-taken-out-of-context-dar-issues-clarification-on-remarks-about-aafia-siddiqui' target='_blank'><strong>'Taken out of context': Dar issues clarification on remarks about Aafia Siddiqui</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir met Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.
“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.
The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.
“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.
 






According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.
The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.
“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.
It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”
Pakistan’s role in regional peace was lauded by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.

Separately, the government conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) award upon Army General Michael Kurilla, Commander of United States Central Command (Centcom), “in recognition of his exemplary service and pivotal role in advancing enduring military cooperation between Pakistan and the United States”, the ISPR announced in a statement.
In a formal ceremony held at the Presidency, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred the decoration upon Gen Kurilla, acknowledging his contributions to regional security and his efforts in bolstering strategic defence ties between Islamabad and Washington. Upon his arrival, the Centcom chief was presented with a guard of honour.
“General Kurilla’s visionary leadership has been instrumental in fostering mutual understanding, enhancing defence collaboration, and deepening counterterrorism cooperation between the Pakistan Armed Forces and Centcom,” the statement read.
“His consistent engagement reflects a profound respect for Pakistan’s central role in promoting peace and stability across the region.”

According to the ISPR, conferring the award represented the “deep appreciation for Gen Kurilla’s unwavering support” and affirmed the depth of Pakistan and the US’ strategic ties.
The statement added that Gen Kurilla held detailed meetings with senior Pakistani civil and military leadership, including the president and COAS. Regional security, military-to-military engagement and joint efforts to combat terrorism were among the topics discussed.
“This high-level recognition underscores the enduring strategic relationship between Pakistan and the United States and reaffirms their shared commitment to regional peace, security and long-term defence cooperation,” the ISPR stated.

In a post on X, he said: “I am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.”
 






Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.
 






Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.
The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman’s confirmation came after the tournament was already expected to be hosted in the UAE.
The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.
The decision followed the ACC’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), held in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially threatening to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.
 
 

The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month.
In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.
During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.
Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.
With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other’s soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.
The UAE, having previously hosted the tournament in similar circumstances, emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615884-pakistan-fully-committed-to-building-secure-prosperous-regional-environment-vows-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment: COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>
