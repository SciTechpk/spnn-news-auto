EVERY year of my journalistic career of nearly half a century, I have known only a free and independent press in the United States.
My professional start was in the 1970s. Those were years when Americans could see clearly how the press served democracy.
With the publication of the Pentagon Papers, first by The New York Times, the American public learned of the failures its government had covered up during a long war in Vietnam that cost so many lives.
Then there was Watergate, an investigation spearheaded by The Washington Post. US citizens learned how their president had weaponised the government against his political adversaries, abusing his powers and sabotaging the Constitution.
In the decades since those revelations, I took for granted that my country would always enjoy press freedom — and that the First Amendment of our Constitution would guarantee it.

We now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between ‘true’ and ‘false’; we cannot even agree on how to determine ‘a fact’

I no longer take any of that for granted. I no longer assume that the constitutional order will hold in the United States. Or that the rule of law will prevail. Or that free expression — not just for the press, but for all Americans – will endure.
That is because we have a president who has demonstrated disdain for traditional restraints on his power. Because a majority in Congress remains servile. Because a majority on the Supreme Court has handed this president extraordinary authority and immunity. Because the president appears determined to lay siege to institutional pillars of democracy, with the press as a high-priority target. And it is because those institutions are proving to be more fragile and faint-hearted than I imagined possible.
And perhaps most concerning to me is that we now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between what is true and what is false. It is only natural — and, in a democracy, expected — that we will disagree about which policies are best. Yet today we cannot agree on how to determine a fact. All of the elements we have historically relied upon to establish facts — education, expertise, experience and, above all, evidence — have been denigrated, dismissed and denied.
How can democracy flourish, or even survive, when we can’t determine the most basic facts. If democracy is in danger, a free press is, too. An independent press cannot survive without a democracy. And there is a corollary to that. A democracy cannot survive without a free press. There has never been a democracy without a media that is free and independent.
The playbook of aspiring authoritarians is well-established. High on their to-do list is crushing the press, an institution that can shed light on what political leaders are up to and that might hold them to account. Their repressive practices extend well beyond the press, however: They seek to abolish free expression altogether: The right of musicians, authors, artists, playwrights and screenwriters to express themselves as they wish. The right of the public to listen to, see and read what they feel they should. The right of business executives, academics, activists and political leaders to advocate for the policies they believe in. The right of every one of us to speak freely with family, friends, neighbors and colleagues without fear of surveillance and reprisal.
The rights that the press strives to safeguard are no different from the rights most people want for themselves — the freedom to inquire into facts, to share what they’ve learned, to communicate what they believe.
Much more is at risk than the freedom to express opinions. The real target of autocrats is truth itself. They aim to extinguish all independent arbiters of fact, whether they happen to be judges, scholars, scientists, statisticians or journalists. In nations tilting toward authoritarianism, heads of state claim sole ownership of the truth. And they rig, suppress or erase data to advance their lies.
 
 

That is what is happening now in the United States. Facts are under attack while government demands that its fictions be unquestioningly repeated.
For decades, the United States was a bastion of free expression of all types, with constitutional protections seemingly secured. That is no longer the case. We were a model for citizens in other nations who yearned for similar liberty. We no longer are. We were a forceful champion for these freedoms elsewhere. Civil rights activists, democracy advocates and independent journalists worldwide often counted on our support when faced with repression. They no longer can expect it.
In a famous 1941speech about four essential human freedoms, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt listed “freedom of speech and expression” as the very first. And he pointedly added the words: “everywhere in the world.”
Today, with an aspiring autocrat as president, the United States is failing to embrace the freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt considered indispensable for a better world. Independent media was already in peril globally, a casualty of diminished confidence in democracy and the rise of a new generation of authoritarians. Our president has placed the press worldwide — and freedom of expression generally — in even greater jeopardy.
What President Donald Trump and his allies contemptuously disregard is why the founders of the United States drafted the First Amendment to the Constitution. James Madison was the principal author. And in describing the role of the press and of free expression, he spoke of the “right of freely examining public characters and measures.”
The word “examining” deserves special attention. Here is how the dictionary defines its meaning: “To inspect closely,” “to inquire into carefully/investigate,” “to test by questioning in order to determine progress, fitness, or knowledge.”
Apply that to journalists, and it means we are not stenographers. Nor should we be. We go behind the curtain and beneath the surface – to learn who did what and why, who will be affected and how, who influenced those decisions and with what intent.
The purpose of journalism, in my view, is to provide the public with the information it needs and deserves to know so that people might govern themselves. Embedded within that mission is a particularly high calling: Holding powerful individuals and institutions to account.
Those with power have the capacity to do enormous good. When they do, and when ordinary individuals do, we in the press should make that known. Praiseworthy efforts to improve society should be shared with others.
At the same time, some wrongs can be committed at extraordinary scale. Often the fault lies with those who possess disproportionate power, including the means to cover up their misdeeds. Immoral or unlawful conduct can go undetected for years, or decades. Ordinary people can suffer severe harm. Victims are often ignored or muzzled.
 
 

So, the public has much at stake in the struggle for free expression and an independent press. People must have a right to voice their grievances. The media should be prepared to listen and investigate.
When there is grave wrongdoing, often no one but journalists will explore the facts. When there are no journalists to report on corruption, inevitably there is more of it, with ordinary citizens paying the greatest price. When no independent media exists to draw attention, those who possess immense power seize the opportunity to acquire more. Their interests are served, the public’s needs are not.
As the US government abandons the cause of freedom worldwide, my hope is that citizens in other countries now will become a model for Americans who took their own freedoms for granted. They can show us how best to struggle against a repressive government. And in the difficult fight to uphold the fundamental democratic principles of free expression and an independent press, they can provide inspiration.

Speaking at the inauguration of the 26th ITCN Asia expo in Karachi, she assured that 5G was on track but dismissed current disruptions as a “technical issue” caused by damage to two submarine cables in the Red Sea near Jeddah.
She said her ministry was taking steps to expand submarine cable capacity and strengthen fibre networks to ensure more reliable internet services.
The minister said IT was also a central pillar of the recently signed Pakis­tan-Saudi Arabia agreem­ent, and the sector would play a key role in economic stability and growth.
She claimed that Pakis­tan’s macro-economic situation had improved, inflation had come down, and international institutions were praising the country’s resilience. Karachi, she said, remained the backbone of national economic development.
Ms Khawaja said the government was pushing ahead with the Digital Pakistan initiative, aiming to expand digitalisation, promote a cashless economy and meet IT ex­­port targets. She said the Special Investment Fa­­cilitation Council (SIFC) was set up to improve the ease of doing business and attract investment.
The minister also highlighted the federal cabinet’s approval of the national Artificial Intelligence policy, stressing that work was underway on its implementation.

But she can belt out Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are a-Changin’” any time she likes, and no-one would guess it comes from a 15-year-old refugee in hiding.
“In the kitchen, the sound is very good,” she told AFP alongside her sister and fellow young bandmates.
By now, Shayma should have been testing the acoustics of her new home in New York.
But before her family’s scheduled February flight, US President Donald Trump indefinitely suspended refugee admissions, stranding around 15,000 Afghans already prepared to fly out from Islamabad.
Thousands more are waiting in the city for relocation to other Western nations, but shifting global sentiment towards refugees has diminished their chances and put them at risk of a renewed deportation drive by Pakistan, where they have long exhausted their welcome.
For girls and women, the prospect is particularly devastating: a return to the only country in the world that has banned them from most education and jobs.
“We will do whatever it takes to hide ourselves,” said Shayma’s 19-year-old bandmate, Zahra.
“For girls like us, there is no future in Afghanistan.”
Not a transit camp
After the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans travelled to Pakistan to register refugee and asylum applications with Western embassies, often on the advice of officials.
Many had worked for the US-led Nato forces or Western NGOs, while others were activists, musicians or journalists.
Four years on, thousands are still waiting, mostly in the capital Islamabad or its outskirts, desperately hoping that one of the embassies will budge and offer them safe haven.
Hundreds have been arrested and deported in recent weeks, and AFP gave interviewees pseudonyms for their protection.
“This is not an indefinite transit camp,” a Pakistan government official disclosed on condition of anonymity. He said Pakistan would allow Afghans with pending cases to stay if Western nations assured the government that they would resettle them.
“Multiple deadlines were agreed but they were not honoured,” he added.
Love for music
Overcoming social taboos, Shayma and her sister Laylama attended the after-school lessons run by an American former arena rocker but had to move to Pakistan after Taliban returned to power.
 
 

One of 10 siblings, Laylama sold sunflower seeds to help support the family. She had cherished a stringless plastic guitar, until she encountered the real thing.
But fearing retribution from the Taliban government, which considers music anti-Islamic, Laylama’s father burned her guitar. “I cried all night,” the 16-year-old said.
Since they were smuggled into Pakistan in April 2022 to apply for refugee status with the United States, Shayma and her bandmates have had to move four times, driven deeper into hiding.
At the start of Pakistan’s crackdown in 2023, the US embassy provided the government with a list of Afghans in its pipeline that should be spared, according to a former staffer with the State Department’s Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts. That office, and the protections it offered, have been dismantled by the Trump administration.
“Leaving these refugees in limbo is not just arbitrary, it’s cruel,” said Jessica Bradley Rushing of the advocacy coalition AfghanEvac.

The WHO said evidence of a link remained inconsistent and urged caution in drawing conclusions.
Trump had linked autism to childhood vaccine use and the taking of Tylenol by women when pregnant.
The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that there was no new evidence that would require changes to the region’s current recommendations for the use of paracetamol, known as Tylenol in the United States, during pregnancy.
“Available evidence has found no link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism,” the EMA said, adding paracetamol could be used during pregnancy when needed, though at the lowest effective dose and frequency. Earlier, Britain’s health regulator said it was safe to use.
“The evidence remains inconsistent,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jaarevi told a Geneva press briefing when asked about a possible link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism. He cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link, but said this was not confirmed by subsequent research. “This lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions,” he said.

• Naushahro Feroze tops the list with 89pc coverage
• 33pc girls immunised in Karachi division; district Keamari ranks last with 12pc coverage
KARACHI: As the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination campaign enters its final stages, data collected by the Sindh Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) shows that Karachi has seen the lowest coverage so far in the province, much to the surprise and disappointment of health department officials and experts.
Launched last week, on Sept 15, the first-ever initiative in the province to protect girls, aged nine to 14, from cervical cancer concludes on 27.
The drive targets 4.1 million girls, aiming to cover 1,190 union councils across 30 districts of the province.
According to the data, 57 per cent girls have been vaccinated in seven days across the province with Naushahro Feroze seeing the highest coverage (89pc) followed by Qambar (88pc), Badin and Sujawal (85pc each), Ghotki (84pc), Sanghar (82pc), Tharparkar (81pc), Sukkur (80pc), Kashmore (79pc), Dadu (74pc), Umerkot (73pc), Khairpur and Tando Muhammad Khan (72pc each), Larkana and Matiari (71pc each), Thatta (70pc), Jamshoro (66), Shaheed Benazirabad (64pc), Shikarpur (59pc), Mirpurkhas (51pc), Tando Allahyar (50pc), Hyderabad (49pc) and Jacobabad (46pc).
Karachi division has seen an overall 33pc vaccination coverage. Of the target 887,692, a total of 288,477 girls have been vaccinated so far.
The highest coverage was recorded in District West (65pc) followed by Korangi (38pc), District South (34pc), District Malir (32pc), Central (27pc), East (22pc) and Keamari (12pc).
“There has been persistent false propaganda against the HPV vaccine by some social media influencers from day one that greatly harmed the campaign in Karachi where they have large following. These people have no medical background. Opposition from certain religious circles came in at a later stage,” Dr Khalid Shafi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association said, while explaining the poor public response to the vaccination campaign in Karachi.
A significant population (affected by the misleading information), he pointed out, decided to wait and see the drive’s outcomes. “Hopefully, the families would re-think their decision. Having said that, our vaccination rates are generally around 70 percent, even without people spreading false information.”
EPI Project Director Dr Raj Kumar described Karachi’s response as “surprising”.
“Towns with low literacy levels have performed better. I think area MPAs and political leaders played a key role in encouraging families (in rest of Sindh) to get their daughters vaccinated,” he said, adding that there wouldn’t be any major change in the strategy at this moment.
“However, we have increased sessions of parental counselling in schools in Karachi where we aren’t seeing encouraging responses. Having said that, the province of Sindh and Karachi have performed better than the rest of Pakistan. For instance, the HPV vaccination coverage in Islamabad is 18percent so far.”
According to officials, Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It’s already being used in Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Indonesia.
Cervical cancer is the second deadliest cancer for women worldwide and a major health threat in Pakistan, with a mortality rate exceeding 65 per cent. The HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine is the first-ever cancer prevention vaccine.
The vaccine, experts say, is safe and effective, providing 100 per cent protection from cervical cancer.

The measures taken for the safety of people will affect tens of millions of people and see multiple factories shut across China’s manufacturing heartland.
Chinese tech hub Shenzhen has ordered the evacuation of 400,000 people, with the city’s emergency management authorities warning of “severe wind, rain, waves and floods”.
“Except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people’s livelihood, please do not go out casually,” the authorities said in a statement, adding that work and market closures will begin in the afternoon.

Other cities in Guangdong province that are implementing the suspension measures include Cha­o­zhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Foshan.
“The strong winds and heavy rainfall that the typhoon will bring will severely impact our city, posing a critical defence situation,” Foshan’s emergency headquarters said in a statement.
Ragasa was generating maximum sustained winds of 230 kilometres (140 miles) per hour at its centre while churning across the South China Sea, according to Hong Kong’s weather service, having earlier hit parts of the Philippines.
Hong Kong shuts down
Hong Kong shut down ahead of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Tuesday, with authorities urging people to stay at home, while most passenger flights were due to be suspended until Thursday.
People piled into supermarkets, leaving little on the shelves, as panic buying set in and residents stocked up on necessities for fear that shops could be closed for two days.
Windows in homes and businesses across the city were taped up, with residents hoping it could help reduce the impact of any shattered glass.

Guangdong authorities evacuated over 770,000 people, state broadcaster CCTV said, adding that more than one million people are expected to be relocated across the province on Tuesday.
Hong Kong issued the typhoon signal 8, its third highest at 2.20pm, which urges most businesses and transport services to shut down. More than 700 flights have been disrupted, including in the neighbouring gambling hub of Macau and in Taiwan.
The weather is expected to deteriorate rapidly.

Palestinian and Jordanian authorities had said earlier on Tuesday that Israel would close the border the following day.
The crossing serves as the main gateway for many Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to travel abroad and is used to transport commercial goods between Jordan and their territory.
The move comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday the government would give its “response” to other countries recognising a Palestinian state once he returns from a visit to the United States.

Allenby Crossing serves as main gateway for Palestinians in the occupied territory to travel abroad

France, Britain, Canada and Australia are among several countries who have or will recognise Palestine this week, in what they hope will revive momentum for the two-state solution.
Some of Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition allies have said that the government should annex the occupied West Bank in response.
Israel fully reopened the Allenby crossing on Monday, four days after alleging that a Jordanian truck driver had shot dead two of its soldiers. The crossing was closed following the shooting.
A spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the Allenby crossing  said it would be closed from Wednesday morning “at the direction of the  political leadership”.
Rally in occupied West Bank
Crowds of people rallied in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, waving flags and holding posters of President Mahmud Abbas to celebrate the wave of recognition by Western powers of a Palestinian state.
Nationalist slogans blared from loudspeakers across the central square in Ramallah, where a crowd of more than 100 clutched Palestinian and European flags alongside signs reading “stop the genocide”.
High-ranking officials from Abbas’s political movement, Fatah, and the Palestinian Authority — which exerts limited control in the occupied territory — shook hands and smiled.
“This recognition is a first step in a process that we hope will continue,” Jibril Rajoub, secretary general of Fatah’s central committee, said.
“It is the result of more than a century of resistance and determination by our people.”
Rajoub said he had felt moved listening to the speeches made at the UN General Assembly in New York the night before.
“We must learn from the past and unite the people,” he said.
Maysoon Mahmud, 39, who is also a Fatah member, said:  “We came here today to thank the countries that have recognised Palestine, but also to ask them to continue to support us in stopping the war.
“It is time for the world to take responsibility.”
Further north in Tulkarem, dozens more gathered, holding the flags of countries that now recognise a Palestinian state.
But many Palestinians expressed ambivalence at the move due to the bitter reality on the ground.
Roula Ghaneb, an academic from Tulkarem, stood impassively in the middle of the Ramallah rally, holding a photo of her 20-year-old son, Yazan.
“He was arrested at our home eight months ago,” she said, adding that he was being held in poor conditions.
Ghaneb said she wanted an end to all violence, insisting: “We don’t want words, we want action.”

• Want case to be heard by full court
ISLAMABAD: Against the backdrop of growing calls for an early hearing, an eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court will resume on Oct 7 proceedings on a set of petitions challenging the 26th Constitution Amendment.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the bench also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
On Aug 20, senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar had written a joint letter following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31, 2024 committee’s minutes that called for a full court meeting to determine the vires of the 26th Amendment.
Two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website on Aug 14, explaining why he had disregarded the committee’s decision. The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past.
In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”
The last hearing on the challenges was held on Jan 27, when the Constitutional Bench had asked different petitioners to consider the existing eight-judge bench as the full court. At that hearing, Justice Mazhar noted: “This is not the domain of the CB to constitute the Full Court or refer the matter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan after Article 191A of the Constitution.” He explained that a Full Court cannot be formed merely on the wishes of lawyers.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, however, issued notices to the respondents on points raised by counsel regarding reference of the matter to the Full Court, the amendment’s impact on judicial independence, and arrangements for live streaming of proceedings.
The Supreme Court is currently seized with multiple petitions filed by the PTI, individuals and various high court bar associations, urging the constitution of a Full Court to hear the matter rather than the Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment.
The petitions had argued that the process through which the amendment was passed contravened Articles 63A, 238 and 239 of the Constitution, pointing to the absence of a fully constituted parliament, the inclusion of defecting members’ votes and other procedural irregularities that allegedly rendered its passage unconstitutional and of no legal effect.
The petitioners also sought to have Sections 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 21 and 27 of the 26th Amendment declared unconstitutional, ultra vires and in direct conflict with the Constitution’s salient features and, therefore, void ab initio.
 
 

They pleaded that any appointments made by individuals or bodies pursuant to the 26th Amendment and its consequential legislation were unlawful and without authority, and should be set aside.
The petitions also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

He has threatened the Afghan Taliban rulers with “bad things” if they do not hand over the former US airbase. He might not have specifically talked about using military force, but has not ruled out the option either. “You’re going to find out what I’m going to do,” he told a reporter when asked whether he would consider sending troops. How seriously should the world take Trump’s latest threat of acquiring a foreign territory?
It’s not the first time the maverick leader has brandished such a wild threat. Previously, he had threatened to take over the Panama Canal and Greenland. He is now focused on regaining control of the former US airbase, as he reiterated at a press conference alongside the British prime minister in London recently.
Although Trump has been discussing renewed American control of Bagram since his return to the White House, his statement at the press conference was more specific. The American president spoke about a possible diplomatic approach in order to reach an agreement with the Taliban administration. “We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us,” he was quoted as saying.

Trump’s threats of reoccupying Bagram intensified after Kabul’s rejection of any deal.

Trump repeatedly cited the base’s proximity to China’s nuclear facilities as a reason to control the key airfield. “It’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” Trump said in his comments during the press conference. Trump has also said that China has established a presence at the base, located 40 kilometres north of Kabul.
Bagram was built by the former USSR in the 1950s but was later vastly improved and expanded by the US military. For decades, the base symbolised not only the struggle for Afghanistan but also the wider contest for influence in one of the world’s most volatile crossroads — where South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East converge.
 
 

It once served as the headquarters of the US occupation forces and their allies. The airbase, which accommodated 10,000 troops at a time, was vacated after the chaotic American exit from Afghanistan in 2021 that also ended the two-decade war. It was the worst humiliation suffered by the world’s most powerful military as the Taliban returned to power.
Interestingly, the withdrawal of American forces from Bagram and the rest of Afghanistan came following the Doha Agreement, which was signed in February 2020 under Trump’s first presidency. But he has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for abandoning the airbase. His threats of reoccupying the base, potentially renewing the American presence in Afghanistan, became more pronounced after a strong rejection by the Kabul administration of any possible deal ceding control of Afghan territory.
An Afghan Taliban official denied that any negotiations were going on with Washington on the issue. The statement said it had been “consistently communicated to the United States in all bilateral negotiations that, for the Islamic Emirate, Afghanistan’s independence and territorial integrity are of the utmost importance”. The statement also reminded stakeholders that, under the Doha Agreement, the US had pledged that “it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs”. It advised Washington to abide by its commitment.
Apparently, the strongly worded statement by the Kabul regime was too much for Trump’s ego. Not surprisingly, his tone has become more threatening towards the Kabul regime. It remains to be seen what option the Trump administration will deploy after the Taliban’s firm rejection of any deal on Bagram. Any use of force would certainly end up in another invasion of Afghanistan, which would have serious consequences not only for the region but also for global peace. It would draw in all the regional powers, especially China.
Responding to Trump’s comments, a Chinese foreign affairs ministry official said that China respects Afghanistan’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. “Afghanistan’s future should be decided by its own people,” the official said, adding: “Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won’t be popular.”
Although China has not formally recognised the Taliban regime, it is among the five countries that have upgraded their diplomatic ties with the interim administration to full ambassadorial status. Beijing is also the largest investor in Afghanistan, primarily in the mining and infrastructure sectors. There are negotiations going on to extend CPEC to Afghanistan. Any military misadventure by the Trump administration in Afghanistan could also pull Russia into the conflict. Russia is the only country that has formally recognised the Taliban regime.
 
 

Pakistan would be directly affected by any American military intervention in Afghanistan, with which it has a 2,500-kilometre-long border. As a front-line state in two previous wars in Afghanistan involving superpowers, which had cost this country massively, it’s still reeling from the effects. Pakistan needs to be extremely cautious of any possible American misadventure.
Over the last few months, we have seen Trump re-embracing Pakistan, showing interest not only in investing in mining but also in strengthening security cooperation with Islamabad. One cannot be sure about Trump’s next move, given his unpredictability and the absence of any institutional policymaking process. One is not sure what kind of expectations he has from Pakistan. These are valid concerns.
It’s true that Pakistan has serious problems with the Taliban regime’s refusal to take action against the militant groups operating from their sanctuaries in Afghanistan. These groups are also believed to have active support from some Afghan commanders, and Pakistan faces a serious security challenge. But any outside military intervention in Afghanistan would also threaten Pakistan’s national security.
Trump must also learn some lessons from America’s military failure in Afghanistan. One can only hope that Trump’s latest threat of retaking Bagram airbase is as hollow as the one to take over the Panama Canal and Greenland.

In particular, residents in the vulnerable area should be taken on board to minimise the chances of collateral damage.
Much confusion surrounds the incident, which occurred in the early hours of Monday. At least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in the blasts, which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses. Sources quoted in the media say that TTP militants had forcibly occupied the dwellings and used them to store explosives. They said that several militants also perished in the blasts.
However, residents of the area and provincial lawmakers dispute these claims, asserting that the valley came under aerial bombardment. A statement attributed to the KP chief minister quotes him as saying that the “martyrdom of civilians” due to “operations against terrorists is unacceptable”.
The civilian deaths have resulted in protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the HRCP, calling for an inquiry into the matter. It is the state’s responsibility to clear the confusion and shed light on the facts. Experience has shown that ‘collateral damage’ can result in increased restiveness in the areas affected by terrorism, and when there is radio silence from the state in situations where civilian lives are lost, hostile narratives and conspiracy theories begin to dominate. That is why the facts must be told.
Having said that, it is unwise for the PTI-led provincial government to politicise the incident. Such sensitive issues should not be used to get back at political opponents, and both the centre and provincial government need to work together to uncover the facts behind the Tirah deaths, and prevent further loss of innocent lives during CT operations.
The unfortunate truth is that KP, particularly its tribal districts, has been in the grip of terrorism for over two decades. That is why along with thorough probes into incidents like the one in Tirah, SOPs need to be developed that can ensure minimum or no collateral damage during CT operations.
 
 

There can be little argument with the fact that all areas need to be cleared of terrorists. Yet these kinetic actions must be undertaken with the buy-in and support of local tribes.
When there is lack of credible information from the state, especially if civilians are caught in the crossfire, anger and resentment in local communities will only grow. Therefore, along with transparency, the residents of the affected areas must be on board in the battle against militancy. With a cooperative approach terrorism can be defeated, and the people of the tribal districts can live in peace.

It said the exercise was likely to be held in Madhya Pradesh.
The drill aimed at assessing the effectiveness and shortcomings of the current air defence capabilities. Confirming the development, a senior official was quoted as saying the exercise would focus on evaluating operational readiness against evolving aerial threats.
The Cold Start doctrine was developed by the Indian armed forces involving rapid, integrated offensive operations by combined arms units. It would thus bypass traditional slow troop mobilisation to achieve conventional objectives within a limited timeframe.

Drill aimed at assessing shortcomings of current air defence capabilities

The doctrine was developed after Operation Parakram exposed India’s slow response to the 2001 Parliament attack, the doctrine aims to provide a swift, decisive, and limited military response to terrorism without triggering a full-scale war. Analysts, however, say it carries a significant risk of escalating conflict to the nuclear level given Pakistan’s possession of tactical nuclear weapons.
 
 

Industry partners, research and development agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, too, will participate in the ‘Cold Start’ exercise.
Speaking at a conference on “Counter UAVs & Air Defence Systems — The Future of Modern Warfare” in Delhi, India’s Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit making a pointed reference to Pakistan said, “They too are working to ‘become like India’, so we must always stay a step ahead.
“Our counter-drone and GPS jamming systems performed effectively during Operation Sindoor, ensuring no damage from adversary drones. But the adversary has also learned our capabilities. Next time, we have to be ahead and much better,” The Hindu quoted him as saying.
He said the vision for the future involves an integrated defence system, inspired by the Sudarshan Chakra concept, to counter drones, UAVs, hypersonic weapons, and other threats. There is a need for systems usable in both peace and wartime, taking into consideration anti-social elements acquiring drone technology, necessitating widespread counter-drone capabilities.

• Boasts of stopping ‘seven wars’; questions the need for a global watchdog
• Criticises European immigration policies, offers his own crackdown on immigrants as a model to follow
• Jokingly complains about malfunctioning escalators, teleprompters
UNITED NATIONS: In a combative, wide-ranging speech before UN General Assembly on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump railed against climate change, and told world leaders their countries were “going to hell” because of their immigration policies.
The 56-minute speech was a rebuke to the world body and a return to form for Trump, who routinely bashed the UN during his first term as president.
Trump, who has cast himself as a peacemaker in a bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize, complained that the United Nations did not support his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
 


“I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help,” he said.
“What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential … but it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential. All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action,” he said.
However, in a meeting with the UN chief after his speech, Trump struck a softer note, saying: “Our country is behind the United Nations 100pc… I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it”.
In a moment of levity, Trump jokingly complained that a UN escalator had abruptly stopped as he and First Lady Melania Trump were halfway up and then the teleprompter in the General Assembly did not work.
“I can only say that whoever’s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said. These are the two things I got from the United Nations a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.” a UN official said the White House operated the teleprompter.
After Trump finished speaking, UNGA President Annalena Baer­bock said: “The UN telep­r­o­mpters are working perfectly.”
‘Pet’ topics
But much of his speech was dominated by two of his biggest grievances: climate change and immigration.
President Trump called climate change a “con job” and urged a return to a greater reliance on fossil fuels as he mocked renewables as a “joke”.
The “carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they’re heading down a path of total destruction,” he insisted.
“We’re getting rid of the falsely named renewables, by the way, they’re a joke, they don’t work, they’re too expensive,” he said at another point, calling wind technology “so pathetic, so bad,” and boasted that he had instead “unleashed” massive efforts to drill for new oil, gas and coal reserves. “Immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,” he said. Trump also offered his US immigration crackdown as a case study for what other world leaders should do to curb mass migration he says is altering the fabric of nations.
He also mocked Nato allies for not shutting down purchases of Russian oil.
“They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. Scientists and world leaders reacted sharply to the US president’s barbs.
“President Trump and his administration continue to spew lies and disinformation about climate science and the overwhelming benefits of clean energy, a grave disservice to the American people,” said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Conc­erned Scientists.
“Climate change is here, it’s costly, and people need real solutions, not propaganda designed to boost the profits of fossil fuel polluters,” she argued.

LAHORE / DADU: The Punjab government on Tuesday announced a relief package for people affected by recent floods, but stopped short of giving a date for its distribution.
“A sum of Rs1 million will be given to the owner of a destroyed house and Rs500,000 for partially damaged houses,” Punjab Inform­ation Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference.
She said that farmers whose land had been submerged would receive Rs20,000 per acre, while compensation of Rs500,000 would be provided for each cow or buffalo lost.
“All these payments are being made from the Punjab government’s own resources without seeking external aid,” she said, taking a jibe at the PPP that has been pressing the federal government to appeal to the international community for help.
Ms Bokhari said that “relief cards” would be introduced so that the flood victims could receive aid without standing in long queues.
She said 10,000 employees had been deployed to conduct surveys in flood-affected areas, but no timeframe had been set for compensation payments.
The minister said that more than 4.7 million people and 2.1 million livestock had been affected across 27 districts and 4,794 villages, including areas along three rivers. “For relief and rescue operations, 2,213 teams are still working in the field,” she added.
Ms Bokhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had visited every flood-hit area and claimed the provincial government had set an example in relief and rescue operations, while criticising opposition parties for politicising the issue.
Breaches in Sutlej embankment
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding triggered by three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the river Sutlej has inundated vast swathes of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, leaving thousands homeless and critical infrastructure severely damaged.
The embankment gave way at three locations — Noraja Bhutta union council in Jalalpur Pirwala, Bahadurpur and Jhangra. One breach widened to 400 feet, while two others stretched 30 to 40 feet.
The breaches diverted the Sutlej’s flow into nearby villages, submerging dozens of settlements, including Jhan­gra, Bahadurpur, Noraja Bhu­tta, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Bash­arat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur and Khairpur Dha.
The floodwaters also damaged the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, creating a lake between the two roads. Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water towards the Chenab River.
A senior irrigation official said 70,000 to 80,000 cusecs of water was still flowing in the Sutlej and could reach the area within a day or two. He said efforts were underway around the clock to plug the breaches, which could take up to 12 days to seal completely.
He said that the authorities were also diverting the water to the canals at Sulemanki and Islam headworks and 20,000 to 25,000 cusecs of water in the Sutlej would further decrease near Noraja Bhutta, which would take the usual course to enter the Chenab River.
Meanwhile, the residents of these union councils were forced to live on Gilani Road and other embankments under the open sky, many without tents or food.
Shakir Kanu of Basti Kanu told Dawn that water would not recede in their areas until the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta dyke were plugged.
He said that most houses in his locality were destroyed or collapsed, while some were under threat due to the continuously rising water.
 
 

“The government is making efforts to save the motorway and bringing heavy stones, but no effort is being made to save our areas,” he lamented.
Mr Kanu further said that the people and cattle heads were not getting proper food and they were also facing medical issues.
On CM Maryam Nawaz’s instructions, 44 additional machines were dispatched to the breach site in Lodhran, with senior ministers overseeing the operation.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.7 million people had been affected across 27 districts, with 271 relief camps and 300 medical camps set up, while over 2.6m people and 2.1m animals had been moved to safety.
According to Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Dire­ctor General Irfan Ali Kathia, the overall water flow in Punjab’s rivers is normal and water levels in flood-affected areas are significantly receding, where rehabilitation measures are ongoing.
Dadu villages submerged
In Sindh, as a medium flood passes through the Kotri Barrage, several parts of Jamshoro district have been submerged.
These include parts of Sehwan, Laki Shah Sadar, Amri, Sun, Manjhand, Lakha, Indpur, Budhapur, Aliabad, Khanot, Petaro, Kotri, Khanpur, and Karokho, among others.
Homes , infrastructure and agricultural land in these regions has suffered extensive damage. In Sehwan, 10 more villages have come under floodwater. The flood has crossed the bridge on Indus Highway and reached the historic Lal Bagh area. Water has also entered the graveyard near Lal Bagh and inundated nearby homes.
Electricity supply has been completely suspended in the riverine areas, leaving residents in a lurch, while road links have been severed as connecting thoroughfares remain under water.
In addition, several parts of Manjhand are under water. Villagers from Goth Detha, located near the shrine of Shah Owais Qarani, are stranded after their road link was severed by rising floodwaters.
The area’s plight was depicted in a video shared on social media, showing a funeral procession trudging though three to four feet of water.

• Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order
• Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse
RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case.
During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court.
On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order.
The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests.
Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership.
According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing.
He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards.
The court adjourned the case till Sept 27.
Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024.
Conjugal rights
Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison.
Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter.
The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing.
During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need.
He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.

• US president calls for immediate end to war, tells Muslim leaders ‘this is the group that can do it’
• Opposes recognition of Palestine statehood in UNGA speech; Rubio says permanent solution only possible through ‘negotiated settlement’
NEW YORK: After an antagonistic speech at the UN General Assembly, where he opposed a growing global push towards the recognition of a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.
The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.”
“We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders.
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back.
“We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said.
‘Stop the war immediately’
Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas.
He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza.
Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead.
“We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said.
Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”.
He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.”
 
 

The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM.
When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.”
The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press.
Plan for peace
According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave.
Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines.
 
 

It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled.
Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported.
Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”.
Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.”
In separate remarks to CBS News, he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.

According to railway officials, six bogies of the train coming from Peshawar derailed after the blast and one overturned, injuring the passengers in that carriage.
It was the second blast in the same area within 10 hours. Earlier in the morning, an explosion had occurred near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country, just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta Railway Station. The train was briefly halted but allowed to continue after security clearance, as the track was not damaged.
Police officials said an explosive device plan­ted on the track was detonated when the Quetta-bound train was passing through the Spizend area.
“Six bogies of the Jaffar Express derailed after the blast and one of them over­t­urned,” a senior Pakistan Railways official told Dawn, adding that five pa­s­s­engers sustained injuries.
 
 

Security forces and pol­ice rushed to the site soon after the blast and shif­ted the injured to a nearby health facility.
The railway officials confirmed 270 passengers were on board at the time of the blast. They said the damaged part of the track would be repaired after security clearance on Wednesday, during which train service would remain suspended.

Nowshera Police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah earlier told Dawn.com that the “Counter-Terrorism Department has been given the task to make efforts and get the abducted people released.”
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at the CTD Mardan Circle Police Station a day ago on the complaint of the engineer’s father under Pakistan Penal Code Section 365A (kidnapping or abducting for extorting property) and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti Terrorism Act.
A statement issued today from the KP Police said officials of the Nizampur Police Station were alerted about the incident.
It added that Nowshera District Police Officer Ahmad Shah assigned the task to Nizampur Station House Officer Altaf Hussain and Sub-Inspector Waqas Yousuf Wittim to safely rescue the abducted men.
“The team rescued the three kidnapped people safely with the cooperation and efforts of local elders,” the statement said.
The complainant had said in the FIR: “My son … is an engineer with a telecom company and he was recently called for the installation of optical fibre cable to Nizampur.“
He said that his contact with his son was disrupted and he constantly tried, but his son’s phone was switched off.
The father added that his son was accompanied by a labourer from Karak and a driver from Parhoti Mardan, who were also taken away along with his son. The FIR noted that on the evening of the incident on Sunday, another son of the complainant received a photo on his WhatsApp of his brother and the two other abducted men with the kidnappers demanding Rs5 million for their release.</p><small>2025-09-23 20:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625218-unga-trump-engages-muslim-leaders-including-pm-shehbaz-on-gaza-and-israel-withdrawal' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, other Muslim leaders discuss end to Gaza war in meeting with Trump</strong></a><br><p>

FM Dar is part of a delegation being led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at a high-level segment of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) from today, drawing the attention of the international community towards the “grave crisis” in Gaza and calling for “decisive action” to end the suffering of Palestinians, according to a statement by the government.
World leaders gather in New York every September for several days of speeches at the annual UNGA session.
Addressing a UNSC session on the Middle East, FM Dar said: “Gaza has become a graveyard for humanity and the global conscience. We call upon the Security Council and the broader international community to act decisively, to uphold human dignity, to ensure accountability and deliver justice.
“The time for words has passed, the time for action is now.”
Reiterating the damage and devastation in Gaza, along with the numerous people killed and the plight of those still surviving, he said the humanitarian situation had reached “catastrophic proportions” with the people starving and famine gripping the territory.
He said Pakistan welcomed France’s summit on the two-state solution, co-sponsored with Saudi Arabia, and commended the recent recognition of the Palestinian state by more UN members, saying it “reflects adherence to justice and the principle of international law”.
 






FM Dar also addressed the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Committee of Six on Palestine, reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.
Stressing that this was a “defining moment” for the Muslim world, he called on the OIC to press urgently for a permanent ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access, an end to illegal settlements, accountability for war crimes, reconstruction of Gaza under the Arab-OIC plan, and the protection of Palestinian lives.
 






The prime minister earlier attended the opening of the general debate of the UNGA’s 80th session with FM Dar.
 






Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar are also accompanying the premier.
 






 






In his address to the General Assembly this year, PM Shehbaz will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, the government statement posted on X said. It added that the PM will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.
PM Shehbaz’s “participation in this biggest annual gathering of global leaders will showcase Pakistan’s strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations and to highlight Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” the statement read.
 






On the sidelines of the meeting, the premier met with Austria’s Federal Chancellor Christian Stocker.
 






He also met Kuwait’s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Khalid.
 






The prime minister had reached New York late Monday night after departing from London.
On the sidelines of the UNGA session, he will also hold meetings with World Bank President Ajay Banga and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
According to the government statement, the PM will exchange views on issues of mutual interest during his bilateral meetings with world leaders and senior UN officials.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN Member States to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council.”
Moreover, he will attend several high-level events, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level meeting of the Global Development Initiative on the theme “Recommit to our Original Aspirations, United to Build a Brighter Future of Global Development” and a special high-level event on climate action, the government statement said.
Trump’s meeting with Arab, Muslim leaders
In New York, PM Shehbaz will also attend a special summit of Arab and Muslim countries, co-hosted by the United States and Qatar, in which US President Donald Trump will also participate.
The prime minister has been specially invited to participate in the summit.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump will hold a multilateral meeting with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan.
A person familiar with the matter said Gaza will be discussed, according to Reuters.
Axios reported that Trump will present the group with a proposal for peace and post-war governance in Gaza.
In addition to freeing hostages and ending the war, Trump is expected to discuss US plans around an Israeli withdrawal and post-war governance in Gaza, without Hamas involvement, according to Axios.
Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported.
Dar in New York
Ahead of the start of the UNGA session today, France and Monaco extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine at a high-level conference in New York on Monday.
FM Dar, who represented Pakistan at the conference, was not among the speakers — which inc­luded heads of state and government from countries such as Turkiye, Australia, Brazil and Canada, among others.
However, he welcomed ann­ouncements regarding the recognition of Palestine by several countries on X.
 






According to state-run PTV News, Dar met Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand today on the sidelines of the UNGA session. “They acknowledged the positive trajectory of Pakistan–Canada relations, agreed to further strengthen economic and trade ties and recognised the vital role of the Pakistani diaspora in Canada,” PTV News reported.
 






Dar also posted a picture of himself with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on X. In his post, he said he had “reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Syrian people”, in his meeting with the Syrian president. “And we shared the resolve to further deepen historic Pakistan–Syria friendship through cooperation across diverse domains, including trade, human capital and development.”
 






State broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported that the foreign minister also met Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretary General Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi.
Dar underscored during the meeting the importance Pakistan attaches to its ties with the GCC and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation with the Council member states, the report said, adding that both sides discussed ways to enhance collaboration across various sectors and to expand institutional linkages between Pakistan and the GCC.
According to the FO, the foreign minister also met his Hungarian counterpart today.
“The two sides expressed their resolve for the early finalisation of the agreement for the protection of mutual investments, agreement on cooperation in the area of civil aviation and commencement of direct flight operations between the two countries, as well as finalisation of visa abolition agreement for diplomatic and official passport holders,” the FO statement said.
 






Yesterday, he took part in the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting at UN Head­quarters. He also participated in consultations hosted by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Other participants included the deputy prime ministers of Jordan and UAE, and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye. He also met with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand.

With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Balochistan Health Department and Quetta Civil Hospital spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig told Dawn.com: “Three people were injured in the blast and have been shifted to the Civil Hospital Trauma Centre, while an injured child has been taken to Combined Military Hospital.”
Muhammad Kashif, Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division public relations officer, told Dawn.com that a railway track was blown up with explosives in the town of Spezand, derailing six bogies.
“The train was coming from Peshawar to Quetta and there were 270 passengers on board,” he said, adding that a relief train was dispatched from Quetta after the explosion, while a team of officers, rescue trucks and private cranes was also rushed to the spot for relief operations.
He said the work of repairing the railway track and removing the bogies would begin in daylight tomorrow, while an investigation into the incident was launched.
Kashif said security forces had cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.
A similar incident occurred last month when six bogies were derailed near the same location.
That incident had come just three days after a Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.
In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail.
A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause.
In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident.
In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.
Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p><small>2025-09-23 19:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24000214562d619.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944158/govt-to-sign-financing-facility-agreement-today-for-reducing-power-sectors-circular-debt' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to sign financing facility agreement today for reducing power sector’s circular debt</strong></a><br><p>The government is set to hold a signing ceremony today for a financing facility agreement to reduce the circular debt in the power sector, according to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
A letter from the Central Power Purchasing Agency to all banks and power sector entities invited their chief executive officers and heads to attend the event.
It said the event will be held at the PMO and PM Shehbaz Sharif will also virtually address the event as he is currently in New York for the UN General Assembly session.
Pakistan’s debt burden has become the defining constraint of its fiscal and economic future. According to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan, the total government debt (excluding the International Monetary Fund) increased from Rs69 trillion in June 2024 to Rs78tr by June 2025.
The public debt (including the IMF debt) increased to Rs80.5tr from Rs71.2tr in June 2024. Both the numbers understate the full level of the government’s indebtedness.
 
 

Developments suggest that the government is negotiating with banks to borrow Rs1.2tr to settle the power sector’s circular debt.
It was planned to borrow Rs1.275tr from banks as the government is willing to settle a portion of the circular debt, which has surged to Rs2.3tr.
What is strange is that this loan will be repaid over six years through a Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) included in the electricity bills.
Initially, the banks were hesitant to meet the government’s request to lend money at a lower rate than the policy rate, but eventually, 18 commercial banks agreed to do so. The loan will be repaid over a six-year period.
“The government has been borrowing less than the maturity amount of treasury bills during FY25, which has substantially increased the outstanding amount. This new borrowing could address this accumulation,” said a banker.</p><small>2025-09-23 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625195-pm-shehbaz-joins-global-leaders-at-unga-opening-session' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz joins global leaders at UNGA opening session</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing a press conference at the Directorate General Public Relations, the provincial minister emphasised that disaster relief should not be politicised.
“The relief cards will ensure that help reaches the right people without making them suffer further. We are focused on serving, not politicising,” she said.
“Should we take advice from those who have turned Sindh into archaeological ruins?” she added, taking a jibe at the Sindh government.
The provincial minister criticised those who she claimed were using the crisis to “advance their political agendas”.
 






“Our focus is on relief and rehabilitation. Not everything should be turned into politics,” she said. “These relief buses and programmes are for the people, not for headlines.”
The Punjab government has announced a compensation package including Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
“All of these funds are from the Punjab government’s own resources. We haven’t asked anyone for financial aid,” Bokhari emphasised.
 






“The [Punjab] chief minister and her team are continuously on the ground, working tirelessly in flood-affected areas. You haven’t seen such governance before.”
Despite the disaster, development work in the province has not stalled, the minister claimed. Under the Apni Chhat, Apna Ghar housing scheme, 80,000 houses are under construction, with the number expected to reach 100,000 by December, she added.
Bokhari highlighted that several federal leaders, including PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani — both belonging to the ruling party in Sindh — have acknowledged the Punjab government’s efficient handling of the flood situation.
“Of course, questions can be raised about why preparations weren’t made during previous floods. But this time, we are fully ready on every front,” she said.</p><small>2025-09-23 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625194-court-hands-14-year-sentence-to-two-for-rape-of-hearing-impaired-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Court hands 14-year sentence to two for rape of hearing impaired girl</strong></a><br><p>

The new process, if finalised, would give heavier weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said.
The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers, it said.
President Donald Trump launched a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January, including a push for mass deportations and trying to block citizenship for children of immigrants in the United States illegally.
In recent days, his administration intensified its focus on the H-1B programme, popular with tech and outsourcing companies for hiring skilled foreign workers. The Trump administration said on Friday it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas.
Some big tech companies warned visa holders to stay in the US or quickly return, sparking a chaotic scramble to get back to the US. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new visas.
The planned regulation, posted on Tuesday, would change an existing lottery process to obtain the visas if demand surpasses supply in a given year, creating wage tiers where higher-paying jobs would have a better chance of being selected.
The process to finalise a regulation can take months or even years. The notice suggested that the new rules could be in place for the 2026 lottery, meaning before a March registration period.
Trump, a Republican, sought to reshape the H-1B process during his 2017-2021 presidency, but was stymied by federal courts and limited time at the end of his presidency.
A similar regulation that aimed to shift the lottery process toward higher-paid applicants was delayed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, before it could go into effect in March 2021. It was then blocked by a federal judge in September 2021 and withdrawn by the Biden administration three months later.
The total wages paid to H-1B workers would increase to $502 million in fiscal year 2026, which begins on October 1, the notice said, citing US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates.
Wages would increase by $1 billion in fiscal 2027, $1.5bn in fiscal 2028 and $2bn in fiscal 2029-2035, it said.
An estimated 5,200 small businesses that currently receive H-1B visas would suffer a significant economic impact due to the loss of labour, DHS said.
US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which issued the proposal, will give the public 30 days to comment beginning on Wednesday, the notice said.
The visa allows American firms to hire skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping them competitive. The programme’s supporters include Elon Musk, a naturalised US citizen born in South Africa, who has himself held an H-1B visa.
Critics argue that the programme allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs.
India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of the approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.</p><small>2025-09-23 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23165730321b3c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944117/former-umpire-harold-dickie-bird-dies-aged-92' target='_blank'><strong>Former umpire Harold ‘Dickie’ Bird dies aged 92</strong></a><br><p>Former Test umpire Harold “Dickie” Bird has died at the age of 92, Yorkshire County Cricket Club announced on Tuesday.
Bird was one of the best-known and most respected officials in the game, standing in 66 Tests and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals.
Yorkshire issued a statement on their website saying Bird, “one of cricket’s most beloved figures”, had died peacefully at home.
“Dickie Bird enjoyed an illustrious career as an international umpire, writing his name into history as the most famous and popular official in the game’s history,” the club said.
“He is synonymous with Yorkshire Cricket, where he has been one of the most loyal supporters. In 2014, he was named president of The Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a role he held with pride and distinction.”
 


Bird played for English counties Yorkshire and Leicestershire but made his name as an international umpire.
“Over a distinguished career, he officiated in 66 Test matches and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals — earning the admiration of players and fans alike for his integrity, humour, and unmistakable style,” Yorkshire’s statement said.
He was given a guard of honour at Lord’s by England and India players before his final Test.
Geoffrey Boycott, the Yorkshire and England batting great, had an enduring friendship with Bird from their days playing for Barnsley Cricket Club in the 1950s.
The 84-year-old summed up Bird’s quirky nature when he recalled how his friend used to insist on calling him Gerald, despite his protestations.
“I would say, ‘My name’s not Gerald, it’s Geoffrey’,” Boycott wrote in the Telegraph. “It made no difference telling him because he would then say, ‘OK, put the gloves on for me Gerald’.
“Dickie was a character and he was always fun. He was respected, admired and loved. He will be given a fond farewell.”
Former England captain David Gower hailed Bird as “one of the best umpires ever to take the field”.
“He certainly set himself high standards as an umpire, but that smile on his face at all times, whether he’s giving you out or not out, whatever he was doing out in the middle, you just knew that Dickie was in the place that he loved best,” Gower told the BBC.
“He was just a very, very good umpire. He had a sense of humour. He had the ability in his own very quirky and slightly barmy way of being able to get on with everyone.”
Graham Gooch, another former England captain, fondly recalled Bird’s habit of becoming embroiled in unusual incidents during matches.
“At Headingley once they had a leaking pipe, right where Dickie was standing,” said Gooch. “Coming up like a sprinkler. It could only happen to him.”
Colin Graves, chairman of Yorkshire, told TalkSport: “It’s a sad day.
“He was a brilliant guy who loved being part of the Yorkshire set-up and everything we do here. He will be sadly missed at Headingley.”
ESPNcricinfo also posted about Bird on X.
 






“[Marylebone Cricket Club] is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Harold “Dickie” Bird,” Lord’s Cricket Ground posted on X.
“An Honorary Life Member of the Club, Dickie enjoyed an illustrious career as an umpire and was one of the most popular officials in the history of the game.”

According to a handout by Malir traffic police, a dumper truck crashed into a motorcycle coming from the opposite direction in Dur Muhammad Goth around 7.30am. “As a result, one of the men on the motorcycle died on the spot, while the other was injured,” the handout said.
The injured was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, it said, adding that the accident was caused by the dumper truck driver’s negligence and reckless driving.
“The driver was arrested on the spot and taken to Memon Goth police station,” the handout said.
It added that both vehicles involved in the accident were also taken to the police station for legal procedure.
Police said further investigation of the incident was underway.
Meanwhile, a young man was injured in a traffic accident in Karachi’s Nazimabad area.
Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre reported that the man was injured while one-wheeling. He died during treatment at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
In another fatal speeding accident near the fire brigade office in Nazimabad, two boys riding a motorcycle lost their lives in a collision with a parked vehicle.
According to a report by the accident branch of Karachi traffic police said the two victims were injured and sent to the hospital via ambulance.
“Both the motorcycle riders died during treatment,” it added.
Separately, a handout by the central traffic police said a motorcycle rammed into a stationary car in Nazimabad around 6.35am. As a result, both people on the motorcycle were injured and taken to the hospital.
Both of them died during treatment at the hospital.
According to the police, the cause of the accident was speeding.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
At least seven members of a family lost their lives earlier this month when a truck crashed into their car on a national highway near Moro.
Last month, three people were killed and one was injured after a car hit a motorcycle at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass.</p><small>2025-09-23 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23180339f8c9caa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944124/ihcs-justice-jahangiri-moves-sc-for-early-hearing-of-plea-against-bar-on-judicial-work' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Jahangiri moves SC for early hearing of plea against bar on judicial work</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri has approached the Supreme Court for an early hearing of his plea challenging the September 16 restraining order that barred him from performing judicial functions after a divisional IHC bench raised serious questions about the validity of his law degree from Karachi University (KU), it emerged on Tuesday.
A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council last year in July while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from KU’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
In an extraordinary development last week, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri challenged the decision in the SC last Friday in person, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The judge subsequently filed an application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, for an early hearing a day ago through Advocate Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah.
The application said the judge was restrained from performing his judicial functions and could not dispense justice, despite the “settled position” in law that such a restraining order could not be passed to stop a high court judge from performing his functions.
“The case concerns the important questions of law relating to the functioning of a judge of the high court and the independence of the judiciary, which are of grave concern to any jurisdiction. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required.
“The impugned order opens the floodgates to litigation where any pending reference/complaint/petition, against any judge, can permit a high court to prevent him from performing his function. Hence, urgent intervention of this court is required to correct course and prevent such actions from straitjacketing the performance of judges of the high court,” the application said.
It argued that the impugned order was passed without considering Dawood’s bona fide, adding that the petition was not maintainable in the absence of such bona fide.
“Hence, this determination must be made at the onset to close the door to any such mala fide litigation initiated against constitutional functionaries. The crucial decision to restrain a judge from performing his function was made without even hearing the counterposition. The petitioner was never heard. Hence, it is imperative that the objections to maintainability to the petition filed against the petitioner be considered at the very onset, to prevent the litigation from unnecessarily precluding the petitioner from dispensing justice in the high court that he serves in.
“The petitioner can only serve as a judge of the high court till a particular age, and time lost due to the operation of the impugned order cannot be regained by him. Hence, this court must urgently intervene in the matter so that the petitioner can be restored and can continue to dispense justice in the high court that he serves in,” the application said.
The judge requested that his petition be fixed for a hearing this week.
The matter is only one of the controversies plaguing the IHC since five judges — namely Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Jahangiri, Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan — had submitted separate petitions at the apex court together on Friday against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.</p><small>2025-09-23 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/231733233e7ea68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944122/saudi-arabias-grand-mufti-sheikh-abdul-aziz-bin-abdullah-al-sheikh-passes-away-royal-court' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh passes away: Royal Court</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia on Tuesday announced the death of Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
“The Royal Court announced today the passing of Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh, who also served as the head of the Council of Senior Scholars, the General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Ifta, and the Supreme Council of the Muslim World League,” SPA reported, adding that the funeral prayers would be him at Riyadh’s Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque today.
The report said King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud also ordered that funeral prayers in absentia also be performed at Makkah’s Grand Mosque, Madina’s Masjid-i-Nabvi and in all mosques across the kingdom.
 






The Saudi Gazette said in a post on X that he was 82.
 






“The Royal Court stated that with his passing, the kingdom and the Islamic world have lost a distinguished scholar who made significant contributions to the service of Islam and Muslims,” SPA said.
It added that King Salman and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also extended their condolences to the grand mufti’s family, the Saudi nation and the Muslim world.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the death, calling it a great loss for the Muslim world.
The president said that Sheikh Abdulaziz’s religious services and scholarly guidance would always be remembered.
 






PM Shehbaz said the deceased was a great religious scholar who spent his entire life in religious activities and forwarding the cause of Islam.
 


“His efforts and scholarly insight for the unity of the Muslim ummah will always be remembered. The Pakistani people and government share equally in the grief of the people of the brotherly country of Saudi Arabia and the Saudi leadership,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that the grand mufti’s services were a “bright chapter in the religious and scholarly tradition”, adding that future generations would continue to receive guidance from his scholarly legacy.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also extended his condolences to the Saudi leadership and people over the grand mufti’s death, paying tribute to his lifelong services and contributions.
He noted that Sheikh Abdulaziz’s scholarly, jurisprudential and religious legacy would remain a “guiding light” for the Muslim world.
“Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah Al-Sheikh held the distinguished honour of delivering the Haj sermon more times than any other scholar, a testament to his profound influence and revered standing in the Islamic world.”

An ATC in Rawalpindi was hearing a case against Imran pertaining to an attack on the army’s General Headquarters GHQ) on May 9, 2023, when the PTI founder’s arrest had sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were torched and vandalised.
During today’s hearing, Imran was included via a WhatsApp call, following the court’s dismissal of a plea for his in-person appearance last week.
His lawyers, Salman Akram Raja and Faisal Malik, sought Judge Amjad Ali Shah’s permission to talk to the ex-premier. But during the call, Imran’s voice was disrupted and his face appeared blurred on screen, leading his lawyers to boycott the court proceedings.
They stated that such a trial was “unfair”.
The court, however, recorded the statements of eight witnesses, including the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority additional director, the Federal Investigation Agency’s technical assistant and the Pakistan Information Department deputy director.
For their part, the PTI lawyers said they “rejected” the recording of witnesses’ statements in this manner.
The court then adjourned the hearing, summoning more witnesses on September 27.
Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.
PTI files plea
After boycotting the court proceedings, Raja also expressed his grievances during his interaction with the media.
“A mobile phone was placed before Khan sahib in jail, on which a video call was made. On this side, the judge received the call on a phone he had,” he said. He added that during the call Imran could not hear what was being said in the court and those present in the courtroom could not hear him.
“Then obviously, Khan sahib is unaware of the testimonies being recorded,” he said.
 






He also shared that they had requested the judge to let them talk to Imran, but they were unable to do so. “The judge said that [we] were unable to talk [to Imran] because the link was very weak.”
He also highlighted that they had the right to talk to Imran alone. “But this right, too, was denied,” he added.
Raja said they had prepared an application, which Malik would be submitting to the court.
“And we have conveyed to the court that it is not possible for us to remain a part of this process … There should be an open trial and the accused should be given the chance to talk to his lawyers,” he continued.
Raja said that they had also filed a plea “against this process” with the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench.</p><small>2025-09-23 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23151313334ba53.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944111/new-wb-report-highlights-rise-in-national-poverty-rate-calls-for-people-centred-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>New WB report highlights rise in national poverty rate, calls for people-centred reforms</strong></a><br><p>A new report published by the World Bank (WB) on Tuesday called attention to the rising national poverty rate in Pakistan, highlighting the need for sustained and people-centred reforms to protect vulnerable populations.
The report, titled “Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan’s Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment”, marks the first comprehensive evaluation of poverty and welfare trends in the country since the early 2000s, according to a WB press release today.
According to the release, the national poverty rate has begun to rise again since 2020, after a steady decline from 64.3 per cent in 2001-02 to 21.9pc in 2018-19.
“This is largely owing to compounding shocks — including COVID-19, inflation, floods, and macroeconomic stress — but also because the consumption-driven growth model that delivered early gains has reached its limits,” it said.
The report explored data from 25 years of household surveys, now casted projections, and geospatial analysis, as well as unique sources of administrative data.
The Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) informed the WB’s official poverty estimates. Beyond the latest available survey round in 2018-19, it used microsimulation models to project estimates, saying that new poverty estimates and trends would be produced after the release of the recently collected HIES 2024-25 data.
 
 

The WB found that the reduction of poverty was primarily a result of rising income from non-agricultural labour, with more households moving from farm work to service jobs.
“However, slow and uneven structural transformation has hindered diversification, job creation, and inclusive growth,” it said, adding that this resulted in low productivity across sectors that constrained income growth. It also pointed out that over 85pc of jobs remained informal and women and youth remained “largely excluded” from the labour force.
Other observations included that nearly 40pc of children were stunted and that a quarter of primary-school-aged children were out of school, while 75pc of those attending primary school had very limited reading comprehension skills.
Additionally, the report found a widespread deficit in public services, with only half of all households having safely managed access to drinking water in 2018 and 31pc lacking safe sanitation.
“The report underscores systematic, complex, and persistent spatial disparities in welfare across Pakistan,” the press release said. “Rural poverty remains more than twice as high as urban poverty, and many districts that lagged behind decades ago continue to do so today. Furthermore, unplanned urbanisation has led to ‘sterile agglomeration’ — crowded settlements with low living standards.”
The WB report called for “sustained and people-centred reforms” to protect vulnerable families, improve livelihood opportunities, and expand access to basic services to alleviate these concerns.
One of the lead authors of the report, Senior Economist Christina Wieser, said, “Reforms that expand access to quality services, protect households from shocks, and create better jobs — especially for the bottom 40pc — are essential to break cycles of poverty and deliver durable, inclusive growth.”
The report outlined four pathways to restoring progress in the fight against poverty. It highlighted the need for investment in people, places and public services, accompanied by strengthening local governance, and advocated for responsive and inclusive safety nets to increase household shock resilience.
It also stressed the importance of progressive fiscal measures, including improving municipal finance and targeting investment in the poorest of the country, and recommended investing in timely data systems to support efficient decision-making processes and track progress.
“It will be critical to protect Pakistan’s hard-won poverty gains while accelerating reforms that expand jobs and opportunities — especially for women and young people,” said Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
“By focusing on results — investing in people, places, and access to opportunities; building resilience against shocks; prioritising fiscal management; and developing better data systems for decision-making — Pakistan can put poverty reduction back on track.”
In January, the World Bank pledged to provide $20bn to Pakistan under a 10-year country partnership framework (CPF) to support inclusive and sustainable development within the country.</p><small>2025-09-23 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625090-afghans-in-pakistan-hoping-for-western-refuge-face-fading-chances' target='_blank'><strong>Afghans in Pakistan hoping for Western refuge face fading chances</strong></a><br><p>

The police had registered a case against Mazari, her spouse, Zainab Janjua and several PTI-linked lawyers, including Naeem Panjhuta and Fateullah Barkiunder, under anti-terror laws after the IHCBA alleged that the bar leadership was “assaulted” by the lawyers, the suspects had also raised slogans against state institutions.
Mazari and the other booked lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
The hearing was presided over by PHC judge Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, who granted a protective bail to the couple and asked them to appear before a relevant court by October 9.
Mazari and her spouse appeared in the court today along with their lawyers
Ataullah Kundi, Jahanzeb Mehsud, and Tariq Afghan.
Meanwhile, Additional Attorney General Sanaullah appeared on behalf of the IGCBA.
 
 

Advocate Ataullah Kundi told Justice Shah that “a case was registered against the two petitioners in Islamabad,” to which he asked whether both of the petitioners were lawyers.
Kundi responded: “Yes, both of them are lawyers and would like to appear in the court.”
Addressing the petitioners, Justice Shah asked if this was their first time in Peshawar, to which Mazari replied in the affirmative, prompting Justice Shah to remark, “At least you came to Peshawar on the pretext of the FIR.”
“You people never come to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa anyway,” he added.
Advocate Kundi argued in front of Justice Shah that “Imaan Mazari is the voice of the people of KP and Balochistan,” adding that she was also a social worker in Islamabad.
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also approached inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
This followed her altercation with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his subsequent remarks over the exchange, which she described as “sexist”.
Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media.</p><small>2025-09-23 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625078-unknown-assailants-maim-buffalo-in-gujrat' target='_blank'><strong>Unidentified men maim buffalo in Gujrat in yet another shocking case of animal abuse</strong></a><br><p>
