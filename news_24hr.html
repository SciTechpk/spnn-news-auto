In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza.







These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip.
Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains, and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave.
Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions.
In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said.
It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.”
“Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.”
The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances.
They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.
“Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said.
The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year. They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. 
They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions.
The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.”
The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.</p><small>2026-01-02 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642843-man-arrested-for-filming-women-in-rawalpindi-hospital-washroom' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for 'filming' women in Rawalpindi hospital washroom</strong></a><br><p>

The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest.
Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia.
The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws.
According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station.
Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station.
The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences.
They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC.
Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC.
They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences.
In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders.
The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentenced handed out to them were to run concurrently.
“The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said.
The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”.
During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused.
Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court.
A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences.
The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023.
The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest.
Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023.
Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases.
“At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”.
“The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-02 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642803-bangladeshs-national-airline-receives-pakistans-nod-for-karachi-dhaka-direct-flights' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh's national airline 'receives' Pakistan's nod for Karachi–Dhaka direct flights</strong></a><br><p>

“We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he said in a Truth Social post.
This follows the deaths of several people as Iran’s biggest protests in three years over economic hardship turned violent across multiple provinces.
The clashes between protesters and security forces mark a significant escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protesting on Sunday over the government’s handling of a sharp currency slide and rapidly rising prices.
Iran’s economy has struggled for years since the US reimposed sanctions in 2018, after Trump withdrew from an international nuclear agreement during his first term.
Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Larijani, said that US interference in Iranian protests would lead to chaos across the region.</p><small>2026-01-02 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02150510d30d45d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964663/female-biker-killed-after-being-hit-by-trailer-in-karachis-landhi-driver-flees' target='_blank'><strong>Female biker killed after being hit by trailer in Karachi’s Landhi; driver flees</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Heavy vehicles’ reign of terror continued in the metropolis on Thursday as a female motorcyclist was killed after being hit by a trailer.
In recent months, the city has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
Quaidabad’s Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammad Ali Shah told Dawn that the driver of a 10-wheeler hit the 20-year-old female motorcyclist on the main Mehran Highway near MN Textile in Landhi.
“She suffered critical injuries and died on the spot,” Shah said.
“The driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the police,” he said.
The body was moved to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities.

 

Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said that a 60-year-old man was killed when a trailer truck hit him in Defence Phase 1 near the Akhtar Colony signal on Thursday night.
The statement added that since January 1, three people had been killed in accidents, while 70 others, including 10 children and 20 women, had been injured.
Friday’s development comes as a ban on the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi has been extended till Feb 22.
On Saturday, four people, including two brothers, were killed in three different accidents on the Super Highway, officials said.
The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2026-01-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642834-federal-cabinet-approves-postponement-of-islamabads-local-govt-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Federal cabinet 'approves postponement' of Islamabad's local govt polls</strong></a><br><p>

The statement from FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi came in response to media queries seeking Pakistan’s response to “developments in the Taiwan Strait”.
“Pakistan and China are iron-clad friends and all-weather strategic cooperative partners. We reiterate our consistent support to China on all matters of its core interests, including Taiwan,“ he said.
“We will continue to adhere to the One-China principle and regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China,” he said.







The FO spokesperson had made similar remarks during yesterday’s weekly press briefing in response to a question regarding the sale of arms to Taiwan by the United States.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan rejects China’s claims.
Although the statement released by the FO on Friday did not make a specific mention of the exact developments it was referring to, it comes after China completed military drills around Taiwan that included live-fire exercises aimed at simulating a blockade of key ports and assaults on maritime targets.
The US State Department on Thursday said the Chinese war games around Taiwan “unnecessarily” spiked tensions in the region, calling on Beijing to “cease its military pressure”.
“China’s military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan and others in the region increase tensions unnecessarily. We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p><small>2026-01-02 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642806-multiple-life-sentences-awarded-to-adil-raja-haider-mehdi-others-over-digital-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Adil Raja, Haider Mehdi, others sentenced to two life terms over 'digital terrorism'</strong></a><br><p>

It is not yet clear what set off the blaze at Le Constellation, killing around 40 people and injuring about 115 others, many seriously.
Bystanders described scenes of panic and chaos as people tried to break the windows to escape and others, covered in burns, poured into the street.
Swiss police warned it could take days or even weeks to identify everyone who perished, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.
“We’ve tried to reach our friends. We took loads of photos and posted them on Instagram, Facebook, all possible social networks to try to find them,” said Eleonore, 17. “But there’s nothing. No response.”
“Even the parents don’t know,” she added.
The exact number of people who were at the bar when it went up in flames remains unclear, and police have not specified how many are still missing.
Le Constellation had a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website.
Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who took over on Thursday, called the fire “a calamity of unprecedented, terrifying proportions”, and announced that flags would be flown at half-mast for five days.
Local police commander Frederic Gisler said authorities were “in close contact with the victims’ families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved”.
“Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,” he told reporters.
The canton’s chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said significant resources have been deployed “to identify the victims and return their bodies to the families as quickly as possible”.
‘The apocalypse’
The fire broke out around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) Thursday at Le Constellation, a bar popular with young tourists.
“We thought it was just a small fire — but when we got there, it was war,” Mathys, from neighbouring Chermignon-d’en-Bas, told AFP. “That’s the only word I can use to describe it: the apocalypse. It was terrible.”
Authorities have declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy, saying only that it was not an attack.
Several witness accounts, broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media, meanwhile, pointed to sparklers that were apparently mounted on champagne bottles held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular “show” for patrons who made special orders to their tables.
There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire”, Axel, a witness present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team.
Pilloud said the investigation would look into whether the bar met safety standards and had the required number of exits.
Red and white caution tape, flowers and candles adorned the street where the tragedy occurred, while police shielded the site with white screens.
After the emergency units at the local hospitals filled up, many of the injured were transported across Switzerland and to neighbouring countries.
The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance, while French President Emmanuel Macron said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian broadcaster Rete 4 that around 15 Italians had been injured in the fire, and a similar number remained missing.
The French foreign ministry said nine French citizens figured among the injured, and eight others remained unaccounted for.
Multiple sources told AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe, but have been unreachable since the tragedy.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02120805447c59c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964655/hrcp-expresses-concern-at-roughing-up-of-youtuber-rajab-butt-during-court-appearance-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern at roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during court appearance in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week.
On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them.
A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him.
“The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X.







“Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said.
The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt.
Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.
On Tuesday, a group of lawyers had stormed the City Courts police station, manhandled a station house officer (SHO) and then staged a protest sit-in on M.A. Jinnah Road demanding an FIR against Mr Butt.
A day later, police had registered a criminal case against several lawyers, including Solangi, for allegedly assaulting the City Courts SHO after he lodged an FIR against them for assaulting Butt.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar.
It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02121222e58e180.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964653/ex-imran-aide-shahzad-akbar-says-uk-residence-subjected-to-deliberate-targeted-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-Imran aide Shahzad Akbar says UK residence subjected to ‘deliberate, targeted’ attack</strong></a><br><p>Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home.
In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”.







Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”.
He held that the incidents were not isolated.
“I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled.
He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”.
“The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said.
Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, said last week that an unk­nown assailant dressed in “construction or waste-collection attire” attacked him in Cambridge.
“The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me,” Akbar posted on X. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.”







The former accountability adviser termed the assault “cowardly” and urged the British government to ensure the safety of dissidents.
“Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out,” he wrote, vowing to continue exposing “corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan”.
This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”.
Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021158133d39520.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964652/australias-usman-khawaja-to-retire-after-ashes-finale-slams-racial-stereotyping' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Usman Khawaja to retire after Ashes finale, slams ‘racial stereotyping’</strong></a><br><p>Usman Khawaja said on Friday he will retire from international cricket after the fifth and final Ashes clash against England, leaving a legacy as Australia’s first Muslim Test cricketer while lashing out at perceived “racial stereotyping” during his 15-year career.
The 39-year-old will pad up for the last time, should he be selected, when the Test gets under way in Sydney on Sunday, ending months of speculation about his future.
It would be an 88th Test for the classy left-hander, culminating a career where it began after making his debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2011, also against England.
“The number one emotion is contentment. I’m very lucky to have played so many games for Australia the way I have,” Khawaja said.
“I hope I have inspired people along the way.

“I’m a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now, and you can do the same.”

Khawaja immigrated to Australia from Islamabad as a child, battling the odds to become the country’s first Pakistan-born, and first Muslim, national player.
At one point, he was the only Asian first-class player in Australia and is credited as a role model who opened doors for others.
“Usman has made a huge contribution to Australian cricket both through his outstanding achievements as one of our most stylish and resilient batters since his Test debut 15 years ago, and off field, particularly through the Usman Khawaja Foundation,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg.
“On behalf of Australian cricket I would like to thank and congratulate Usman for all he has achieved.”
Khawaja’s foundation helps youths from refugee, immigrant, Indigenous, and poor socioeconomic backgrounds through introductory cricket programs and educational support.
‘Attacked me’
Khawaja, a qualified pilot, has plundered 6,206 runs in Test cricket with 16 centuries, averaging 43.39.
He smashed a career-high 232 against Sri Lanka a year ago, but has not made three figures since.
The current Ashes series has been a rollercoaster ride, with the veteran batsman coming under scrutiny.
He injured his back in the first Test in Perth and was replaced as opener in the second innings by Travis Head who blasted a match-winning century.
Khawaja did not feature in the next match at Brisbane and was omitted from the team for the third Test in Adelaide, only to get a lifeline when Steve Smith dropped out ill just before the toss.

         View this post on Instagram            

He came in at number four and hit 82 and 40 before making 29 and 0 in the fourth Test at Melbourne.
“I’m glad I get to leave on amy own terms, with a little bit of dignity, and go out at the SCG where I love,” he said, while expressing frustration at how he was treated.
“When I did my back (in Perth), I hurt my back and had back spasms and it was something I couldn’t control.
“The way the media and past players came out and attacked me. I could have copped it for a couple of days but it went on for five days.
“The way everyone came out at me about my preparation, ‘he’s not committed to the team. Only worried about himself. Playing a golf competition. He’s selfish, he didn’t train hard enough. He’s lazy’.
“These are the same racial stereotypes (I thought we had moved past).
“But obviously we haven’t fully moved past that. I haven’t seen anyone treated like that in the Australian cricket team before.”
He nevertheless admitted the writing was on the wall during the current Ashes series.
“Going into Adelaide and then not being picked initially for that game was probably a sign for me to say ‘all right, it’s time to move on’,” he said.

M. A. Jinnah was 36 years old; his interrogator was Murray Hammick of the Royal Commission on Public Services (and a future governor of Madras).
Jinnah was arguing that a native might make as good a judge as any white man. For us poor stragglers in 2025, one exchange stands out:
Hammick: How do you propose to recruit this higher judicial branch, which you say should be recruited from the bar?
Jinnah: I should say by nomination only … [which] must be in the hands of an independent board.
Hammick: What board would you have?
Jinnah: I should like to have a board consisting of the judges of the High Court, and some of the leading members of the bar, because those are the only people who would be really competent to judge.
Well over a century ago, Jinnah’s instinct was the correct one: that the rule of law is best guarded by judges appointing judges. Not the executive (read: the generals); not ruling party parliamentarians; and not — as one laughably effete suggestion has it — academics, commentators, social scientists, and Charlie’s aunt.
To the Quaid, it would be judges and some of the bar. Sadly, this formula took a century to find its closest expression: in the judicial commission of the 18th and 19th amendments. While infiltrated by two of the executive’s men — the attorney general and the law minister — and saddled with a mostly defunct parliamentary committee, the judges nonetheless held sway.
It was an arrangement far from perfect, but much better than the alternative: judges appointed by shahi firman. We know this because Pakistan’s history has proven Jinnah right and right again: as we’ve written in these pages, coups came gift-wrapped as early as 1954; ex-chief justices became Ayub and Yahya’s law ministers; Bhutto extended pliant judges, and Zia purged defiant ones.
In fact, whenever the judiciary snatched back some degree of independence — whether in the Al-Jehad case in 1996, or through a new commission in 2010 — it was in direct response to executive excesses: Benazir packing the court, or Musharraf placing judges under house arrest.
The rise and rise of the suo motu, doubtless abused, was again a correction to Musharraf’s henchmen yanking a serving chief justice by the hair; the Lawyers’ Movement exploded into the streets soon after.
All of which makes much of this year’s commentary around the judiciary so absurd: it’s almost as if activist judges were born in a vacuum, in a country that never saw four martial laws, far more PCOs, the physical storming of the Supreme Court, or the May 12 massacre in Karachi.
And almost as if 2025 — the year of the 26th’s amendment’s consequences and the 27th’s birth — wasn’t the exact opposite of the founder’s vision.
The ‘Constitutional Bench’ upends the Constitution
The year began with the Pakistan that Qazi Faez Isa had left behind: judicial appointments stripped of their independence; a regime installed via a stolen election that the Isa court had shut its eyes to; and a ‘Constitutional Bench’ far, far away from public confidence.
Never did a judicial successor have such a low bar to overcome. It is to the Yahya court’s distinction that the contest is now a close one.
That is, if it can still be called a Yahya court at all, which didn’t author a single decision of enduring legal worth this year. It focused its energies instead on inventorying its broom closet — 6,344 cases have been “e-filed”, sings the Court’s website, and 8,735 judgments boast QR codes in the manner of ketchup bottles.
At other times, it amused itself with painful bureaucratese: like permissions for foreign travel, or new codes of conduct demanding a near-monastic withdrawal from public affairs — both benefit mediocrities with nothing to contribute intellectually in the first place.
If there was a new centre, it was the Constitutional Bench’s Justices Mazhar and Aminuddin, whose verdicts were at par with the executive’s wildest dreams. By the time the year closed, lawyer-columnists had dubbed the Constitutional Bench the treasury bench.
Courts-martial of civilians return
For starters, consider military trials of civilians: it took the combined might of the bogus practice and procedure law, the 26th amendment, and a second bench formed by Justice Isa to reverse the Court’s striking down such trials from two years ago.
‘Fair trial,’ held Justice Aminuddin in the appeal, ‘does not mandate that every forum must be identical in structure to regular courts.’
To support this remarkable statement, the Constitutional Bench reached for F. B. Ali’s case from half a century ago – all the better to try civilians today.

 

But F. B. Ali centred on a coup-happy brigadier, a law from the era of Ayub’s long-dead 1962 constitution, and a decision at the height of Bhutto’s emergency – when fundamental rights were suspended. No matter: the bench just pretended the last fifty years hadn’t happened.
In yet another throwback to the grim past, Justice Mazhar’s concurrence even brought out the Latin maxim salus populi suprema lex esto (the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law), an old favourite of Sharifuddin Pirzada’s for invoking necessity.
So it was that military trials of civilians returned to the books. Yet even after so much engineering, the final tally still stood at 7-5 against military trials of civilians, both benches taken together.
If the appellate verdict now holds, it is only as a result of the crudest gerrymandering – that too within the same Supreme Court.
Reserved seats go to the losers
As the summer hit, the Constitutional Bench also thought to undo the verdict of the voter: in one of the most controversial decisions of our legal history, it was held that reserved seats should go to the losing parties.
Armed mainly with a single technicality — that the Sunni Ittehad was before the Court and not the PTI — the review bench reversed a decision that was superior in reasoning, broader in scope, and far truer to the spirit of the law.
That a 12-member bench thought itself competent to review the decision of a 13-member original bench was unprecedented. No reasons were given.
Equally unprecedented was that a review bench would include as its head the author of the dissent in the original verdict, Justice Aminuddin, but drop the eight-member majority’s author, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah. No reasons were given.

 

Then there was also the astounding fact of Justices Mazhar and Rizvi setting aside the original verdict of Justices Mazhar and Rizvi, when not a single novel argument was advanced before the review bench that they hadn’t heard previously. Again, no reasons were given.
Oddly enough, the same Justice Mazhar spent four whole pages on the importance of precedent and how judges should ‘honour the decision of prior cases’ in the military trials appeal. Come reserved seats, however, and all precedent was tossed aside, including his own. (His Lordship also held in that same concurrence that judicial review merited a larger bench. The reserved seats review was, it bears repeating, one judge smaller.)
Whether the Constitutional Bench was wrong in Shuhada Forum or wrong in Sunni Ittehad, we never found out.
If anyone was wrong, it was the voter – for voting. ‘When a voter casts his vote for an independent candidate,’ held Justice Aminuddin, ‘he knows that his election will not result in having any impact on the elections to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.’
Perhaps. But the voter likely didn’t know that Justice Isa would effectively disenfranchise him with the  bat symbol verdict, that the election commission would pretend the party he had most voted for – the PTI – had been dissolved, or that the Constitutional Bench would shanghai his votes and hand them over to the parties he expressly voted against.
Hopefully, the voter will know more, and vote better, the next time. Until then, the reserved seats review has handed the unity regime a two-thirds majority it never won – and thus the very wrecking ball it would soon swing at the judicature.
Dogar Court II
With the Supreme Court fast sinking into irrelevance, it was thought to neutralise the last holdout of the post-restoration judiciary: the Islamabad High Court.
It started almost as soon as the year began, when Justice Sarfraz Dogar was parachuted in from the Lahore High Court and, as the judges would later point out in a future petition, elevated to acting chief justice not two weeks later. Permanency followed.
This extraordinary transfer was approved by Chief Justice Yahya and validated by Justice Mazhar: in his eventual judgment, the latter quoted the former, ‘The thoughtful consideration behind the proposal illustrated resolve in providing an equitable share to linguistic diversity of our country and fair chance of representation to all the federating units in the High Court of the common capital of the Federation.’
Linguistic diversity or no, Justice Dogar’s language soon became noteworthy instead for his widely condemned remarks addressing lawyers Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha; these were censured by the Karachi Bar Association, while the Lahore High Court Bar Association called for his removal. (The judge later said his statement, reported verbatim, was taken ‘out of context’.)
Perhaps it was also out of context that blameless lawyers – some of them Islamabad’s most capable – were hit with anti-terrorism FIRs for no other reason than peacefully protesting the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri.
Which brings us to the other timeline for this story, one that kicked off in the summer before last: when Islamabad’s election tribunal, headed by Justice Jahangiri, was looking into allegations of widespread vote rigging.
On 21 May 2024, Justice Jahangiri ordered that NA-47’s returning officers appear or else face arrest. Some days later, he provided a last opportunity to PML-N MNA Tariq Fazl Chaudhry for submitting his Form-45 to the court.
On 23 May 2024, 48 hours after Justice Jahangiri’s order, the University of Karachi received an application seeking the verification of his law degree. This sordid drama would climax just a few days ago, when Justice Dogar ordered that Justice Jahangiri be denotified as judge.
In fact, if the cost of courage versus compliance has to be measured, one needn’t look further than the contrasting fortunes of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Islamabad High Court to know which is which.
Islamabad’s Justice Babar Sattar, for example – whose bravery and brilliance sequentially upset the PTI, the PDM, and the establishment – passed landmark decisions on the right to privacy and against illegal surveillance; on asylum, on rape victim testimony, on child marriage, and on competition regulation. His jurisprudence both clarified the law as well as actively upheld citizens’ rights.
Yet for Justice Sattar as well as the courageous Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq, tax references are in the offing instead, while Justice Kayani continues to be precluded from the chief justiceship that should have been his a year ago.
Or, as the five Islamabad judges summed up themselves in their case before the Supreme Court, ‘The demolition of the IHC and its independence that is being witnessed today is only because the petitioner judges dared to object to the executive’s interference in their judicial work and uphold their oath as judges of the IHC.’
But under the unity regime, such oaths weigh heavy.
Jokes are illegal
Meanwhile, the ‘unity’ parliament, fractured and compromised, also chose to immunise itself from the naughty words of the public. In February, it took just fifteen minutes to pass the Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act, 2025; a law advertised as a cure for ‘fake news’ and administered, with far greater efficiency, as a remedy for dissent.
This has been a part of the law’s DNA for long: since its enactment in 2016, Peca has done less to protect women or counter terrorism than to hammer journalists and dissidents, a record that human rights groups continue documenting with weary consistency.
But the 2025 amendments cross into full Orwell territory: undefined offences of ‘fake’ or ‘false’ information, and a ban on ‘aspersions’ against the state, are now the new normal. That means everything from satire to memes has turned into prosecutable risks.
And why not? In a land where laughter is fast becoming the last refuge, few phrases disturb the centre more than ‘Form-45’; the safer course is to suppress the utterance itself. Enforcement has followed: between summary trials and frozen accounts, the state alone determines the nature of truth.
Statistics bear this out. From January to July, 99 cases were filed against journalists under the amended law for alleged ‘anti-state’ acitivities.
In this, Peca joins a venerable tradition: to the British master, sedition charges were thought the best medicine for sharp tongues.
So it carries on.
The 27th’s mindless talking points
As if the 26th weren’t enough, the latter half of 2025 was consumed by calls for the judiciary’s further immolation in the form of a Federal Constitutional Court.
The cons and cons of such a trainwreck have been written at length, and can be read here. Three judges of the superior courts have since resigned out of principle, and the quality of justice is much poorer for it. Of course, such principle could have changed entire outcomes, at least in the Supreme Court, had it been deployed as early as the bogus practice and procedure decision, or when bizarre dissents arrested the holding of elections in 90 days.
Equally bizarre  is the dishonesty with which such an amendment continues to be sold.
Electoral losers that somehow find themselves in parliament, boomer cultural critics, even some lawyers writing in Dawn, have shrugged off the destruction of the judiciary by arguing how awful it was anyway: the soaring pendency, the bottoming out in global indices, and pharaohs for chief justices.

 

They also point to political leaders – in the main, premiers Bhutto, Gilani, and Sharif – paying with their life or their ministries at the hands of the judicature.
Too often excluded from such criticism is what the judges should actually be most reviled for: like constantly ushering the jackboot into the palace, from Dosso to Zafar Ali Shah. (Then again, it would be silly to overtly criticise that which is being implicitly defended.)
Besides the Sharif-Bhuttos’ attacks, there’s also a fair bit of conservative rage over other verdicts: the establishment’s over Pervez Musharraf’s treason sentence, as well as the PTI’s for the midnight reversal of Imran Khan dissolving his assembly, which ended with the fall of his government in earnest.
Let’s presume all those decisions were wrong.
Let’s presume that, besides the obvious fact of his sham trial, Mr. Bhutto wasn’t actively trying to murder Ahmad Raza Qasuri and that all seven Supreme Court judges (including the three dissenters) were in error for sentencing his FSF hitmen to die.
Let’s presume – letter sent or unsent – Asif Zardari wasn’t convicted for corruption by a Swiss court, and that the Sharifs actually did establish the documentary genesis of their London flats in the run-up to all that goofy iqama business.
Let’s also presume General Musharraf was within the law for declaring emergency just to kidnap judges, and that Imran Khan could shut down and then erase the parliament he was directly answerable to, just to get around the no-confidence vote.
That the judges got it backwards each one of those times.
Is the solution to past injustice ensuring that justice can’t ever be done in the future, for anyone? Put another way, was a single prominent decision of the now-redundant Constitutional Bench actually constitutional?
A more honest reason is revenge: that it was high time the third branch was put in its place. But those exulting that the judges deserve it seem to be yelling into the abyss: one that saw the quiet retirements of Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar eons ago, and a decline in suo motu ever since.
Because, in the ultimate analysis, the judiciary was chained not for what it got wrong, but what it got right. The bogus practice and procedure law came on the heels of the Court ordering elections in 90 days.
The 26th amendment was rushed through the assembly to counteract sensible verdicts in the reserved seats and military trial cases.
The Islamabad High Court was torpedoed after six of its judges protested interference; Justice Jahangiri’s persecution began as soon as he tried shedding light on last year’s polls.
Finally, the 27th amendment’s FCC — a civil law mutant in a common law country — was thought the permanent fix to what has now passed into history as the post-restoration judiciary (2009–2023). As both its admirers and enemies agree, what began with Iftikhar Chaudhry’s return concluded with Umar Ata Bandial’s retirement.
In the time since, two successive chief justices lowered the drawbridge from within, and then showered the invasion with roses.
And if said invasion was the state’s revenge, then only the citizen suffered in 2025. It is prayed the new year free us of such wanton experiments, and be kinder to Pakistan and its now-buried justice system.
As for those that cheered this destruction on, it is sincerely hoped they can remain as cheerful when facing, inevitably, the new kind of courts they have installed.
That might speed up the realisation that worse judges are, in fact, worse for everyone.</p><small>2026-01-02 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021117432bf7e94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964651/canada-asks-air-india-to-probe-incident-of-pilot-reporting-for-duty-under-influence-of-alcohol-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Canada asks Air India to probe incident of pilot reporting for duty under influence of alcohol, source says</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s transport regulator has asked Air India to investigate an incident of a pilot reporting for duty under the influence of alcohol and failing two breathalyser tests, a person familiar with the matter said.
The tests were conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport, after the pilot was asked to leave the aircraft, the person said.
The incident was labelled as a “serious matter” by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India, and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added.
The person requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Transport Canada did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular working hours.
In a statement, Air India confirmed the flight from Vancouver to Delhi on December 23 experienced a last-minute delay due to the incident, adding that an alternate pilot was brought in to operate the flight.
“The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said.
“Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.”
The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said.
India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022.

 

Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny.
This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making.
The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters.
The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.</p><small>2026-01-02 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/012106481bbe77f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964466/karachis-deadly-roads-and-the-limits-of-enforcement' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s deadly roads and the limits of enforcement</strong></a><br><p>A few months ago, traffic on Karachi’s busy Rashid Minhas Road was moving with its usual chaos when a routine commute turned fatal. On the Askari Flyover, a 22-year-old woman riding a motorcycle hit a pothole while travelling in the fast lane. She lost her balance and fell onto the road.
Within seconds, a water tanker approaching from behind ran her over and killed her on the spot.
The incident barely stood out in a city accustomed to daily road fatalities, yet it captured the lethal mix that defines Karachi’s traffic crisis. Reckless driving, excessive speed, crumbling infrastructure, and weak enforcement of traffic laws have become the hallmarks of the city’s roads.
A pressing issue
In 2025, while Karachi grappled with a series of troubling developments, fatal road accidents emerged as more than just routine headlines in the national media, as they evolved into a significant political issue as well. At one point, the situation became so volatile that fears resurfaced of ethnic tensions spilling over, a spectre that has historically undermined the city’s peace and stability.

 

A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year.
In its annual road accident report, the department recorded a noticeable decline in both fatalities and injuries, attributing the improvement to stricter enforcement, data-driven interventions, and closer coordination with transport stakeholders. According to official figures, 477 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the first six months of the year, compared to 326 fatalities in the second half.

A similar trend was observed in the number of injured persons. While 886 people were injured in road accidents between January and June, the figure fell to 642 during the next six months of the year, reflecting a decrease of 244 injuries, or about 40 fewer injuries each month.

The police link this progress to the formation of the Karachi Road Accident Analysis Team, which was tasked with identifying accident-prone locations, analysing underlying causes, and monitoring emerging patterns. Recommendations made by the team led to targeted preventive and corrective measures across the city, which authorities say produced tangible results.
During this period, traffic police officials also engaged transporters and other stakeholders through a series of meetings, resulting in measures such as the mandatory installation of tracking systems in commercial vehicles and stricter compliance with traffic regulations. Awareness sessions focusing on road safety, monitoring mechanisms, and legal responsibilities were also conducted to improve discipline among drivers.

The department said it will continue coordinating closely with the transport sector while strengthening enforcement, emphasising that evidence-based policymaking and sustained oversight remain central to its efforts to reduce road traffic accidents and protect lives.
‘Enforcement-led gains not enough’
While the official figures point to measurable progress, urban planning and road safety experts caution that enforcement-led gains alone cannot address Karachi’s deeper mobility crisis. They argue that the city’s road fatalities are rooted in structural flaws from car-centric planning and fragmented transport governance to unsafe infrastructure for pedestrians and motorcyclists.
Without a comprehensive mobility reform plan that prioritises public transport, road design standards, and institutional coordination, experts warn that recent improvements risk remaining temporary rather than transformative. Urban planning and population dynamics, they believe, play a crucial role in shaping Karachi’s traffic patterns and road safety challenges, which is a perspective that highlights why enforcement alone cannot resolve the city’s mobility crisis.

“Karachi has experienced sprawl and population growth in a complex manner,” says academic, researcher and urban planner Dr Noman Ahmed, who also serves as the Pro-Vice Chancellor of NED University of Engineering and Technology.
“The magnets of employment and enterprise show a pattern of corresponding residential developments around them. For example, the fruits and vegetable market is a source of daily-wage employment for hundreds of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers. One finds informal housing hubs evolving around it.
“Similar patterns are also observed around truck and bus stands, transit terminals and extension of existing informal settlements in the west and south of the city. This population requires internal streets, neighbourhood roads and arterial roads to enable proper connectivity. As a consequence, existing roads are intensively used.”
He emphasises that commuting choices, rapid motorbike adoption, and risky driving behaviours compounded by poor infrastructure are driving Karachi’s rising road accident rates, which require targeted interventions and systemic reforms.
“The commuting choices impact the traffic management and road safety concerns,” he says. “A rapid growth in motorbikes is an example. With very limited options of public transport, a sizable number of teenagers and working men, now also women, are adopting motorbikes as an option. With limited training, inadequate safety arrangements on roads, and poor quality of road infrastructure, road traffic accidents are on a dangerous rise.”
Can stricter enforcement alone reverse Karachi’s deadly road safety trend? Traffic authorities believe it can, at least to a certain extent, arguing that deterrence remains the most immediate tool available to curb reckless driving and restore discipline on the city’s roads.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Traffic, Karachi, Peer Muhammad Shah, maintains that the introduction of the e-challan system, enhanced surveillance and stricter enforcement has begun to deliver measurable results.
“Change is impossible without deterrence,” he says, adding that traffic disorder and undisciplined driving habits have become deeply embedded over the years. According to DIG Shah, before the introduction of digital enforcement mechanisms, Karachi recorded an average of three road accident deaths per day.
“With the e-challan system in place, this figure has dropped to two fatalities per day,” he says, calling it an “encouraging” sign.
He acknowledges that heavy vehicles, particularly dumpers and water tankers, continue to pose serious challenges. To address this, traffic police are establishing four new fitness centres in Karachi where the fitness and licensing of dumpers will be checked on a priority basis.
“No dumper will be allowed on the roads without an approved tracking system,” he adds.
Need for addressing deeper structural problems
While traffic police credit enforcement with reducing fatalities, urban planners caution that such gains may prove short-lived unless deeper structural problems are addressed.
According to experts, fines and surveillance can correct behaviour, but they cannot compensate for flawed road design, inadequate public transport and unsafe infrastructure.
“Karachi’s roads were designed to accommodate usual vehicle loads based on earlier land-use patterns,” says Dr Ahmed. “Over time, the origins and destinations of traffic have changed, but the roads have not evolved accordingly.”

He points to the University Road as a prominent example, where the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for the Red Line has reduced available road space despite the artery serving numerous educational institutions and rapidly densifying neighbourhoods.
“While the BRT will carry a limited number of passengers along its corridor, the reduction of vehicular lanes will act as a perpetual bottleneck, especially during peak hours,” he says.
Beyond capacity issues, Dr Ahmed highlights basic design failures that continue to expose road users to danger, including the absence of road markings, encroached or missing footpaths, lack of directional signage, inadequate street lighting and deteriorating pedestrian bridges. These deficiencies, he says, disproportionately affect pedestrians and motorcyclists who are the most vulnerable groups on Karachi’s roads.
Dearth of public transport options
Experts also link the rising accident toll to the city’s chronic public transport deficit. With few reliable and affordable options available, residents increasingly rely on motorcycles and private cars, a trend that urban planners describe as fundamentally unsustainable.
“The exponential rise in motorbikes and motor cars cannot be controlled through enforcement alone,” Dr Ahmed says. “Only cheap, accessible and reliable public transport can reverse this trajectory.”
He argues that shifting more than two-thirds of work-related trips to public transport would significantly reduce congestion, optimise road space and lower accident risks. This, he believes, requires a fleet of 100- and 70-seater buses connecting major neighbourhoods and acting as feeders to BRT corridors, supported by safe footpaths, pedestrian crossings and a unified fare system such as a single transport card.
‘Collective criminalisation of dump trucks is unjust’
Meanwhile, transporters argue that enforcement drives have unfairly singled them out. Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, Liaquat Mehsud, says that while accountability is necessary, collective criminalisation of dumpers and their operators is unjust.
“If a dumper causes an accident, then take action against that driver and vehicle,” he says.
“Conduct an investigation, seize the vehicle and punish the offender if the crime is proven. We stand with the law. But it is unfair to label everyone associated with this profession a criminal without due process.”

In the interview defending his health, the US leader also changed his previous statement about receiving an MRI scan in October, saying it was instead a quicker CT scan.
Trump, who at 79 is the oldest person to assume the US presidency, told the Journal “my health is perfect” and expressed frustration with scrutiny of his well-being.
Trump has based much of his political image on projecting vigour whether through his frequent interactions with journalists, constant social media posting, or AI memes depicting him as a superhero.
However, the first year of his second term in office has raised growing questions.
His right hand shows persistent bruising, often covered with thick makeup and at times a bandage, and his ankles have appeared swollen.
On occasion, Trump has clearly struggled to keep his eyes open, including during a televised Oval Office meeting with health representatives in November, a politically sensitive issue for someone who constantly frames his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as “sleepy”.
Bruising and ‘blinking’
The Republican explained the bruising on his hand as the result of aspirin that he takes daily to thin his blood. “I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” he told the Journal.
He said he applies makeup or bandages when his hand is “whacked”. One cut, he said, was caused when his attorney general Pam Bondi hit the back of his hand with her ring while giving him a high-five.
Explanations of his health issues have been inconsistent.
Trump himself told reporters that he underwent an MRI scan in October, but said at the time he had “no idea what they analysed”.
To the Journal, Trump said it was not an MRI, “it was less than that. It was a scan”.
Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, confirmed to the newspaper that a CT scan a procedure that takes far less time than an MRI was done “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues”.

TAXILA: Archaeologists excavating the ancient Bhir Mound have unearthed decorative stones dating to the 6th century BC and rare coins from the 2nd century AD, a discovery officials are hailing as the most significant at the site in a decade.
The finds were made during ongoing excavations at the Unesco-listed site, which is regarded as the earliest urban settlement of the extensive Taxila civilisation.
Experts uncovered fragments of metamorphic decorative stone identified as lapis lazuli, alongside the rare bronze coins attributed to the Kushan dynasty, dramatically pushing forward the material narrative of ancient Gandhara.
Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Arch­aeology who serves as head of the excavation team, confirmed the preliminary analysis of the artefacts.
“The decorative stones are lapis lazuli, a prized semi-precious stone, while the coins belong to the Kushan period,” Mr Dogar said.
The excavation team relied on specialised forensic assistance to date the metal artefacts. Mr Dogar noted that detailed numismatic analysis conducted by specialists from the University of Peshawar confirmed that the coins bear the image of Emperor Vasudeva. Vasudeva is recognized by historians as the last of the ‘great Kushan rulers’ who presided over the region.
According to Mr Dogar, the obverse of the recovered coinage depicts Vasudeva, while the reverse features a female religious deity.
Mr Dogar described this specific imagery as a distinct hallmark of Kushan-era religious pluralism, which often blended various theological traditions.
The artefacts were discovered on the northern side of the archaeological remains, specifically within the B-2 trench — one of 16 distinct trenches currently excavated at the site. Dogar said the surrounding archaeological evidence reveals that these specific remains constituted a residential area.
These latest discoveries affirm that Taxila reached the zenith of its political, cultural, and economic influence under Kushan rule, particularly bet­ween the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.
“Under emperors such as Kanishka the Great, Taxila emerged as a major administrative, commercial, and intellectual centre,” Mr Dogar said.
Mr Dogar added that widespread Kushan patronage of Buddhism during this era led to the construction of stupas, monasteries, and vast religious complexes.
The period also marked the rise of Gandharan art, a distinctive synthesis of Greek, Roman, Persian, and Indian traditions, with Taxila serving as its core hub.
Malik Tahir Suleman, a renowned numismatist, told Dawn that Kushan coins serve as some of the most critical historical sources for understanding ancient South and Central Asia.
“Issued between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, Kushan coins evolved from Indo-Greek imitations into a sophisticated imperial currency system,” Mr Suleman said.
“Struck mainly in gold, copper, and bronze, they reflect the empire’s economic strength and vast trade networks, including links with Roman markets.”
Mr Suleman said Kushan coinage is distinguished by its rich iconography and multilingual inscriptions.
He explained that they often depict rulers in Central Asian attire on one side and a remarkable range of deities — from Helios and Mithra to Shiva, Nana, and the Buddha — on the other.
Beyond the coins, the discovery of the deep-blue lapis lazuli fragments provides vital clues regarding anci­­ent supply chains. Mr Dogar noted that the stone has been valued for mil­­lennia across ancient civilisations.
“Its presence at Taxila points to long-distance trade links, particularly with Badakhshan in present-day Afghanistan, a historic source of lapis lazuli,” Mr Dogar said.

TEHRAN: Protesters and security forces clashed in western Iran on Thursday, leaving six people dead in the first fatal violence since cost-of-living demonstrations erupted earlier this week.
The unrest, triggered by soaring inflation and a collapsing currency, has spread from the capital to other major cities.
The semi-official Fars news agency reported that two civilians were killed in Lordegan, following confrontations with security services. Meanwhile, state media confirmed that a member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed overnight in the city of Kouhdasht.
The violence marks a significant escalation in the demonstrations that began on Sunday, when shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike to protest economic stagnation and high prices.
By Tuesday, students from at least 10 universities had joined the movement, which has since expanded to include closing major bazaars across the country.
“Some protesters began throwing stones at the city’s administrative buildings, including the provincial governor’s office, the mosque, the Martyrs’ Foundation, the town hall and banks,” Fars reported regarding the situation in Lordegan.
The agency stated that police responded with tear gas after the buildings were “severely damaged” and arrested several people described as “ringleaders”.
In Kouhdasht, state television cited Said Pourali, the deputy governor of Lorestan Province, reporting the death of a 21-year-old member of the Basij. The channel said the man was killed “by rioters while defending public order”.
Mr Pourali noted that “during the demonstrations in Kouhdasht, 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing”.
However, accounts of the violence vary. The rights group Hengaw repo­r­ted that security forces killed and wounded several people in Lordegan.
Regarding the death in Kouh­dasht, the Revolutionary Guards accused demonstrators of taking advantage of the protests.
Contrarily, Hengaw identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard and alleged he was a protester killed by security forces.
Hengaw also reported that a protester was shot dead on Wednesday in Isfahan province in central Iran. Reuters could not immediately verify these reports.
Protests also took place on Thursday in Marvdasht in the southern Fars province, the activist news site HRANA reported.
Hengsaw said Wednesday’s events included demonstrations and detentions across Kermanshah, Khuzestan, and Hamedan.
The unrest comes at a critical moment for Iran’s clerical rulers.
The economy has been hammered by Western sanctions and a currency that has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year.
Inflation reached 52 per cent year-over-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran.
The country is also recovering from regional tensions that led to a 12-day air war in June, during which Israeli and US airstrikes targeted the country’s nuclear infrastructure and military leadership.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sought to calm tensions on Thursday, acknowledging the protesters’ “legitimate demands” and calling on the government to improve the economic situation.
“From an Islamic perspective … if we do not resolve the issue of people’s livelihoods, we will end up in hell,” Pezeshkian said at an event broadcast on state television.
Despite the conciliatory tone, authorities promised to take a “firm” stance against disorder. Iran’s prosecutor general warned on Wednesday that while peaceful economic protests were legitimate, any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a “decisive response”.
“Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,” the prosecutor said.
Government spokesperson Fate­meh Mohajerani announced on Thur­sday that authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trade unions and merchants, though she did not provide further details.
The current demonstrations remain smaller than the nationwide uprising in 2022, which was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code. That wave of anger left several hundred people dead.
Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday evening the arrest of seven people allegedly affiliated with “groups hostile to the Islamic Republic based in the United States and Europe”, claiming they were “tasked with turning the demonstrations into violence”.
Local media coverage has been mixed, with some outlets highlighting economic hardships while others focus on incidents caused by “troublemakers”.

Official data show SBP’s reserves stood at $11.7bn on Jan 3, 2025, rising to $15.915bn by the end of December — an increase of $4.2bn. However, reserves grew by only $1.4bn in the second half of the year, from $14.5bn on June 30 to $15.9bn at year-end.
While the overall increase has strengthened external buffers and supported the exchange rate, a significant portion of the reserves comprises loans from friendly countries.
The central bank aims to raise reserves beyond $18bn by the end of FY26, but the slower accumulation in recent months has raised concerns. Despite record remittance inflows providing space for dollar purchases from the interbank market, reserve growth remained modest.

 

During January-September 2025, the SBP purchased $4.2bn from the market, reflecting a lower level of buying compared to last year. Over the previous 16 months, the central bank had purchased $9.7bn, which helped rebuild reserves.

Gains slow in second half as pace of accumulation slows down

The higher reserves contributed to exchange rate stability, enabling the economy to remain relatively steady despite weak economic growth and rising poverty.
Analysts warn that the second half of FY26 (January-June) could prove challenging, with the country facing large loan rollovers, the need to curb the trade deficit, boost GDP growth and create jobs for millions of skilled and unskilled workers.
In its weekly statement, the SBP reported that its reserves rose by $13 million to $15.915bn in the week ended Dec 26, 2025.
Total liquid foreign reserves held by the country stood at $21.012bn, including $5.097bn with commercial banks.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan said 2025 was relatively more stable than 2024, noting that the rupee remained firm against the US dollar. Since the IMF’s earlier agreements, volatility in the dollar had been contained, he added.
Despite historically low investment levels, Mr Bostan said investor confidence had improved, though he cautioned that stagnant export growth remained a key concern.
Economists and analysts also point out that despite higher reserves and a stable exchange rate, the country has yet to attract sufficient domestic and foreign investment to revive economic activity and achieve higher growth.

ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.
These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday.
Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows.

 

The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives.
Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan.
In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured.
The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations.
Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance.
Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year.
These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others.

The premier emphasised that looking into domestic energy resources was critical for national economic stability.
He also ordered the digitisation of the entire supply chain for the import and domestic utilisation of oil and gas on a priority basis.
“With the digitisation of the oil and gas supply chain, smuggling of these products will be effectively curbed, which will ultimately benefit the national exchequer,” the prime minister noted.
The meeting was info­rmed that the Oil and Gas Development Comp­any Limited (OGDCL) had discovered significant new oil and gas reservoirs in the Nashpa Block area of Kohat district.
The newly discovered re­s­e­rves are expected to yield around 4,100 barrels of oil per day.
The meeting was also informed that domestic con­sumers experienced improved gas pressure during the current winter season against last year.
Officials said work on RLNG connections had been stepped up, with a target of providing 350,000 new connections by June 2026.
The meeting was further told that pipelines for the Sheva and Batani gas fields had been commissioned, while work on the pipeline from the Kot Palak gas field was underway.
Chairing a separate mee­ting on economic reforms, the PM highlighted that implementation of the government’s economic governance policies was inevitable. He sou­ght proposals from all relevant ministries sugges­ting practical measures and a comprehensive strategy invo­lving minimal duration.

ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners.
The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy.
“We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said.
Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported.
Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day.
Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council.
At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”.
“So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said.
Exchange of lists
Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown.
Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.”
He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added.
India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani.
The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
“Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said.
Dulhasti power project
The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.

 

Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations.
“No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.”
The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart.
Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.”
He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday.
He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough.
Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down.
“The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties.
He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”.
In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.
“If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to.
‘Outright rejected negotiations’
Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations.
“We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government.
“The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said.
In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.”
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020722450d022a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964638/new-york-mayor-mamdani-vows-to-enact-democratic-socialist-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>New York Mayor Mamdani vows to enact democratic socialist agenda</strong></a><br><p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s mayor on Thursday, vowing during a public swearing-in ceremony on the steps of City Hall to enact an aggressive agenda aimed at making the nation’s largest city more affordable for working people.
Mamdani, a member of his party’s left-wing democratic socialist faction, was elected last November in a prominent victory that could influence this year’s midterm elections that will determine control of the US Congress. Some Democrats have embraced his style while Republicans portray him as a foil on the national political stage.
The 34-year-old campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues and was sharply critical of Republican US President Donald Trump, whose approval rating has fallen over the past year amid economic concerns.
Many of New York’s 8 million residents — some with hope, some with trepidation — expect him to be a disruptive political force.
In a speech following his public swearing-in, Mamdani promoted core campaign promises of universal childcare, affordable rents and free bus service.
“We will answer to all New Yorkers, not to any billionaire or oligarch who thinks they can buy our democracy,” he said. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist.”







‘Tax the rich’
The programme for Mamdani’s inauguration included remarks by US Senator Bernie Sanders and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fellow democratic socialists at the vanguard of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.
Sanders, whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, defended Mamdani’s agenda.
“Making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical,” Sanders said. “It is the right and decent thing to do.”
The crowd of several thousand cheered loudly when Sanders called on America’s millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes, breaking into a chant of “tax the rich”.
Even with temperatures well below freezing, the city set up a viewing area along Broadway to allow thousands more to watch a livestream of the ceremony, which included musical performances.

 

Mae Hardman-Hill, 27, volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign and said it felt like his political momentum was growing.
“I’m a native New Yorker. I’ve watched the city like you just become less and less affordable, less and less livable,” Hardman-Hill said. “I’m really excited for … regular people to get some power back again.”
Prior to the public ceremony, Mamdani was privately sworn in as New York City’s mayor in the first minutes of the New Year on Thursday at the historic City Hall subway station, which was decommissioned decades ago and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.
Reflecting his Muslim faith, he used the Holy Quran for his swearing-in, a first for a New York City mayor.
Republicans blast Mamdani
Hours after Mamdani took office, the lead group tasked with electing Republicans to the US House of Representatives sought to portray him as a “radical socialist”.
“Every time Mamdani opens his mouth or swipes his pen, he tattoos the Democratic Party’s failures onto every House Democrat facing voters in 2026,” spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement that signaled the sizable role Mamdani is likely to play on the national campaign stage.
Mamdani, a former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for the Democratic Party around the country ahead of November midterm elections.
Dean Fuleihan, the incoming deputy mayor, told the Financial Times that Mamdani will move ahead with plans to increase taxes on millionaires to pay for his campaign promises and balance New York’s budget.
He added that he doesn’t expect rich people to leave the city as a result of potentially higher taxes.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul has said she opposes raising personal income taxes but is considering raising corporate taxes to pay for a potential budget shortfall amid federal cuts.
In one early reversal, Mamdani said on Wednesday that he would no longer seek to end mayoral control of New York City’s public school system, the largest in the US, naming veteran educator Kamar Samuels as chancellor.
Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 per cent of the vote in November, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.
Inauguration of a new era
The Uganda-born Mamdani has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.
Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg’s first term in 2001.
As mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilisation programme, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan’s upscale Upper East Side.
Bankers and others in New York, the nation’s financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election many have explored how to work with him.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020725203fe1f0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964543/traders-question-inflation-figures-despite-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Traders question inflation figures despite relief</strong></a><br><p>• Vegetable price slump offsets costlier staples• Tomato glut eases prices, hurts growers• Flour, milk and meat rates climb
KARACHI: Traders appear dissatisfied with the official inflation numbers, despite the fact that prices of many items have declined compared to rising trend in other items.
Consumers have found some relief in vegetable prices, with tomatoes leading the decline. Tomato prices have dropped to as low as Rs30 per kg in various cities, although this relief for consumers has hit growers hard.
In Karachi, several pushcart vendors are seen offering 2.5kg to 3kg tomatoes for Rs100, owing to heavy arrivals from producing areas.
According to the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the last week of December 2025, the national average price of tomatoes ranged between Rs30 and Rs130 per kg across different cities.
Consumers are also benefiting from improved onion supplies from producing areas, thus dropping the national average price to Rs60-140 per kg from Rs110-180 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
The national average price of new potatoes has also plunged to Rs30-100 per kg, compared to Rs80-150 per kg a year ago, in various cities.

 

During October 2025, in contrast, consumers had paid Rs600-700 per kg for tomatoes in various parts of the country, while onion prices had reached Rs220 per kg.
Pulses prices have largely remained stable. The national average price of gram pulse decreased to Rs220-350
per kg from Rs330-450 per kg over the past year.
The average prices of moong, masoor and mash stood at Rs340-470, Rs240-330 and Rs360-530 per kg, respectively, compared to Rs350-470, Rs260-370 and Rs440-590 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
Fresh milk prices in the country edged up to Rs170-260 per litre from Rs150-240 a year back.
The price of a 20kg wheat flour bag jumped to Rs1,810-2,650 from Rs1,580-2,200 after an increase in wheat rates whose 10kg bag price soared to Rs1,052 from Rs806 over the past year. The average price of fine flour rose to Rs132 per kg from Rs111.
The national average price of 1kg ghee pouch, 2.5kg ghee pack and five-litre cooking oil also increased to Rs560-590, Rs1,400-1,588 and Rs2,850-3,110, respectively, from Rs545-585, Rs1,370-1,500 and Rs2,695-2,945 a year earlier.
The price of beef with bones and mutton (average quality), which were Rs700-1,300 and Rs1,550-2,400 a year ago, has soared to Rs900-1,450 and Rs1,700-2,550 per kg, respectively.
Prices of Basmati broken rice have slightly surged to Rs140-300 per kg from Rs130-280, while prices of Irri 6/9 rice
in Sindh and Punjab remained unchanged at Rs110-200 per kg during the last one year.
Zaid Bin Haris at Sherman Securities said the food index rose 3.2pcYoY, due to increase in prices of wheat (up 20.8pcYoY), chicken (up 16.11pcYoY) and meat (up 13.56pcYoY).
Mr Haris attributed the rise in wheat prices to higher retail rates, prices, supported by a new government wheat policy raising its minimum support price (MSP) to assist flood-affected farmers. He added that chicken and meat prices increased YoY due to higher feed costs and weak enforcement of price controls, keeping market prices above official rates.
‘Highly disappointing year’
Separately, All Karachi Tajir Itehad Chairman Atiq Mir termed 2025 as a “highly disappointing year” in which trading and business activities shrank by 60pc, alongside rising food prices, unemployment and declining business confidence and investment.
In a statement, he further said no new industrial units were set up during the year, which led to increased capital flight amid an uncertain business environment.
While painting a bleak outlook for 2026, Mr Mir said the government appeared non-serious in providing a business-friendly environment, citing rising prices of power, gas, LPG, petrol and diesel, along with a number of taxes and duties.

Police sources said tickets for the musical night were sold at Rs5,000 for families and Rs2,000 for individuals. However, tickets were allegedly sold beyond the venue’s capacity and adequate arrangements for spectators were not made.
As a result, the area reserved for spectators became overcrowded. A large number of ticket-holders also gathered outside the venue in an attempt to gain entry.
Security guards of the housing society stopped the gathering and did not allow them to enter the concert venue, prompting protests by the ticket-holders.
It has yet to be established how the protest turned violent and which side took the first step in disrupting law and order. A police contingent was deployed at the venue for security and crowd control, but it reportedly remained a silent spectator until the situation worsened.
During the protest, a physical confrontation broke out between the ticket-holders who were denied entry and the security guards. Both sides pelted stones at each other, while the guards also used batons to disperse the crowd.
The use of force further angered the gathering, which then began damaging property.
Police intervened when the situation went out of control and used force along with anti-riot gear to disperse the protesters. During the police action, a couple of protesters were picked up and taken to police installations.
Videos that went viral on social media showed some youngsters throwing stones at the guards and damaging property. In the clips, guards can also be seen chasing and manhandling some of the youths.
The housing society management had arranged the musical concert and sold tickets in different categories. Some participants alleged that despite purchasing tickets, they were not allowed entry, which became the initial cause of the disturbance.
Sources said the society management was planning to register an FIR, but no official complaint had been lodged so far. 
According to sources, the management told the police that they would come to lodge a complaint, but it remains unclear when this will happen.

The strike had been called in protest against the alleged victimisation of the Karachi Bar Association’s former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. During the strike, judicial proceedings were strictly prohibited within the city courts’ premises.
According to an order issued by PbBC Executive Committee’s Chairman Zabiullah Nagra, the action was taken after receiving a letter from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association.
The letter drew the council’s attention to a “video circulating on social media in which Advocate Ashfaq was seen appearing before the Karachi City Courts while representing TikToker Rajab Butt during an ongoing lawyers’ strike,” said Nagra.
“It further observed that the advocate appeared before the courts despite the strike, allegedly accompanied by private guards or individuals in clear violation of the strike restrictions and the established canons of the legal profession,” the order stated.
It further noted that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”.
“These remarks reportedly caused divisions within the legal fraternity, leading to confrontation and discord among lawyers,” it added.
As per the order, Advocate Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.
Examining his professional record, the order said that Advocate Ashfaq was registered as an advocate with the PbBC in 2010 and the high court in 2012.
“As a practising lawyer,” the council asserted that Advocate Ashfaq was “duty bound to uphold the dignity and high standing of the legal profession at all times”.
“The executive committee unanimously decided to suspend Advocate Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect,” it said.
The committee also referred the matter to the disciplinary committee of the council for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation of the licence in accordance with law.
Talking to Dawn, Nagra said the PbBC, as a statutory regulatory body, was not required to issue a prior notice before suspending a lawyer’s licence in cases involving professional misconduct.
“Every enrolled advocate is presumed to have full knowledge of the code of conduct prescribed under the Bar Council rules and is duty-bound to comply with it,” he said.
Council’s executive committee chairman added that the lawyer concerned had been found involved in activities “unbecoming of a member of the legal profession” for quite some time.
On Monday, YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
The hearing, during which the Youtuber was represented by Ashfaq, was marred by violence and chaos.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-01 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642686-27th-amendment-pti-seeks-disqualification-of-senator-saifullah-abro-for-defection' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: PTI seeks disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for defection</strong></a><br><p>
