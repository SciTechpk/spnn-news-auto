Nashra isn’t known for her batting, and Rana keeps it tight to her. Just three runs coming off that one.

Over 40 — Pakistan 150/8

She loses shape while trying to hit out Gaud who gets a wicket first ball after her return into the attack. Captain Fatima is the next batter in — she’s a bit of a maverick with the bat and Pakistan need a crucial contribution from her today.

Pakistan have opted to bowl first, with Sadiq Iqbal opening for the Green Shirts as they face India in the cricket field yet again on Sunday, this time in the Women’s World Cup 2025.
While India is hosting this year’s tournament, Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model decided in November after India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.
 






Fatima Sana is leading the Green Team, while Harmanpreet Kaur is captaining the Women in Blue. The game will begin at 2:30pm PKT at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
As of 2pm (Sri Lanka time), ESPNcricinfo reported that the weather was “dry, although there are dark clouds hovering over the stadium”.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) had said “fans have free entry to all” the World Cup matches being played in Colombo.
 
 

As the rivals meet for a fourth consecutive Sunday on the cricket field, tensions from the recent men’s Asia Cup may spill into the ongoing event as well.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in Asia Cup, Sana made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
Earlier this week, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said there was “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players would shake hands during their fixtures.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05213043ad591f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946750/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-malaysia-for-comprehensive-talks-on-economic-engagement' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Malaysia for ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has arrived in Malaysia for a two-day official visit, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
The broadcaster reported in a post on X that he arrived at Kuala Lumpur’s Banga Raya International Airport, being welcomed by the Malaysian information and communications minister and the Pakistani high commissioner to Malaysia.
PM Shehbaz was then escorted with a royal protocol to his accommodation, where he was welcomed by his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim.
 






“I am extremely delighted to be in Malaysia; I express my gratitude to the prime minister of Malaysia for the warm reception,” PTV News quoted him as saying. “This visit will further strengthen Pakistan-Malaysia bilateral relations.”
 






Upon his departure, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.
Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-05 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627112-50-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-quetta-and-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>5.0-magnitude earthquake jolts Quetta, adjoining areas</strong></a><br><p>

A Credit Default Swap-implied probability estimates the likelihood that a borrower — such as a company or a country — will fail to repay its debt. This probability is derived from the market price of its CDS, which is a type of financial insurance investors buy to protect themselves against the risk of default, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
If the cost of a CDS drops, it means investors see the borrower as less risky. So, when Pakistan’s CDS-implied probability falls sharply, it indicates that global investors believe the country’s chances of defaulting on its debt have significantly decreased.
“As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg, Pakistan stands out globally as the 2nd most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied default probability globally,” Schehzad wrote in a post on X.
 






He added that the country stood second only to Turkiye in the global emerging market (EM) rankings in default risk reduction, as the country has recorded one of the sharpest drops in sovereign default risk globally over the last 15 months (from June 2024 to September 2025).
“Notably, Pakistan is the only country in the EM sample showing consistent quarterly improvement across the past year,” he wrote, adding that the country’s default probability has decreased by 2,200 basis points.
“This marks the sharpest decline among major EMs, ahead of South Africa (3 per cent), EI Salvador (2pc). In contrast, countries like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and others have seen their default risks rise.”
Schehzad further said the sharp decline in the country’s risk signalled “strengthening investor confidence, underpinned by macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, timely debt servicing, and staying the course with the International Monetary Fund.”
He also cited the recent positive ratings movements from global credit rating agencies like S&P Global, Fitch, and Moody’s as a factor.
In a message to investors, Schehzad said. “Pakistan is steadily rebuilding market credibility, standing out as one of the most improved sovereign credit stories in the emerging market universe.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the IMF released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators.</p><small>2025-10-05 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05200914c3fd294.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946797/islamabad-residents-urge-authorities-to-intensify-action-against-surge-in-stray-dog-population' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad residents urge authorities to intensify action against surge in stray dog population</strong></a><br><p>Residents of various sectors of Islamabad have demanded that authorities intensify efforts to tackle the rising number of stray dogs in the city.
Pakistan faces a worsening stray dog crisis marked by rising dog bites and rabies cases. The problem stems from unchecked breeding, poor waste management, and inadequate vaccination or sterilisation efforts. Authorities’ reliance on culling has drawn criticism from animal rights groups, which call for humane, coordinated strategies focused on vaccination, sterilisation, and awareness.
According to a report by the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), citizens have reported that several areas — including sectors G-6, G-10, I-8, F-11, and surrounding localities — have been witnessing increased activity of stray dogs, often moving in aggressive packs.
It added that multiple dog bite cases have been reported, with children and elderly residents being the most vulnerable.
“This is not just a matter of nuisance — it’s a public safety emergency. Authorities must act swiftly to implement humane and effective population control measures, ensure vaccination of stray animals, and protect residents from further harm,” said Dr Riaz Naru, a resident of G-6/4, who was bitten by a stray dog near Qutub Shaheed Masjid on Street 55.
Residents have urged the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (IMC), and district health authorities to take immediate and coordinated action.
They emphasised that mass sterilisation, vaccination drives, and the creation of designated shelters were essential to address the issue in line with public health priorities and animal welfare standards.
 
 

Meanwhile, a CDA official said that the Municipal Corporation Islamabad (MCI) and CDA had “intensified efforts” to address and prevent the rising number of complaints regarding stray dogs in the federal capital.
Last week, Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi had directed the MCI and CDA to take urgent remedial measures amid a growing number of complaints from citizens.
 
 

Joint teams from CDA and MCI sprang into action, actively conducting operations, and the registration and resolution process for public complaints has been expedited. Per the report, citizens can register complaints through the 24/7 operational helpline 1334, which caters to both urban and rural areas of Islamabad.
Improved arrangements have also been made at the Stray Dog Centre located in Tarmri, where the trap, neuter, vaccinate, and release (TNVR) method is being implemented. Under this method, stray dogs are captured, neutered, vaccinated, and relocated to safe areas.
According to CDA records, between July and September 2025, action was taken on hundreds of reported cases from various markets, residential sectors, and rural localities. Areas covered include sectors G-14, D-12, F-6, F-7, I-9, I-10, G-10, F-11, and neighbourhoods such as Saidpur, Margalla Town, Bhara Kahu, and the Red Zone.
 
 

During this period, over 550 stray dogs were relocated to the Stray Dog Centre.
The MCI administration stated that all complaints are being addressed promptly and that the Stray Dog Centre is fully operational.
Citizens can lodge complaints through the 1334 helpline or the DC Office Portal for immediate action regarding stray dogs, the report added.</p><small>2025-10-05 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05191419c43927a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946799/mercedess-russell-wins-singapore-gp-and-mclaren-seal-second-consecutive-constructors-title' target='_blank'><strong>Mercedes’s Russell wins Singapore GP and McLaren seal second consecutive constructors’ title</strong></a><br><p>Mercedes’s George Russell won the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday ahead of Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, as McLaren clinched the Formula One constructors’ championship.
Oscar Piastri was fourth, which meant his lead over his McLaren teammate Norris in the drivers’ standings was cut to 22 points. The 27 points scored by Piastri and Norris were more than enough for McLaren to equal the record set by Red Bull in 2023 by winning the team title with six races to spare.
It was McLaren’s second title in a row and the 10th in the team’s history.
Kimi Antonelli crossed the line fifth in a Mercedes, followed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Fernando Alonso, Oliver Bearman and Carlos Sainz rounded out the top 10.
Russell’s Mercedes was on pole and got away cleanly from Verstappen’s Red Bull at the start, but the drama all happened behind.
Norris, from fifth on the grid, darted past Antonelli and dived up the inside of Piastri, who started third, at turn one. Norris was flying and clipped the back of Verstappen on the way to barging his way into third place in a wheel-to-wheel clash with teammate Piastri.

The championship leader was not impressed. “So are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way there? What’s the go there?” Piastri complained on team radio.
His anger was not appeased by the team saying they would discuss the incident after the race and not order Norris to swap places.
“That’s not fair. I’m sorry, that’s not fair,” Piastri said.
After pitting for hard tyres, the leading four emerged in the same order, though Verstappen was reporting downshift problems with his gearbox that felt “like a handbrake”.
By lap 41 of the 62, Norris had the ailing Verstappen in his sights but found it impossible to get close enough to pass on a Marina Bay Circuit where overtaking is notoriously tricky.
The night race in tropical Singapore was declared the first official Formula One “Heat Hazard”, meaning that all drivers had to have liquid-cooled vests available, though wearing them was not mandatory.
However, with the air temperature around 28°C for the night race, rather than the expected 31°C, some opted not to use the new equipment, including Verstappen.</p><small>2025-10-05 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05195308e29acc0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946798/50-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-balochistans-quetta-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>5.0-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of Balochistan’s Quetta: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>A 5.0-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Quetta on Sunday evening, the government of Balochistan’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said.
According to PDMA, the earthquake was recorded at 06:29pm, approximately 65 kilometres west of Quetta at the geographical coordinates of Latitude 30.19°N and Longitude 66.33°E, with a focal depth of 25 kilometres.
The monitoring data were analysed through automatic seismic mode. Tremors of mild to moderate intensity were reportedly felt in Quetta and adjoining areas, it said in a statement.
It said that the authority was in coordination with the district disaster management authorities to assess the situation. “As of now, no immediate reports of losses or damages have been received from any district.
“The PEOC (Provincial Emergency Operations Centre) [of] PDMA Balochistan is in coordination with DDMAs (District Disaster Management Authorities) to assess the situation,” the authority said in a statement. “As of now, no immediate reports of losses or damages have been received from any district.”
In June this year, two separate earthquakes were reported within the province.
On June 30, a moderate 5.5 magnitude quake struck the Musakhail district, injuring five people and damaging dozens of mud houses. The PMD said that the first tremor struck Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri and surrounding areas at 3:24am with a magnitude of 5.5 and a depth of 28km, while the second tremor, measuring 4.8, was recorded at 7:30am.
On June 15, an earthquake hit Pasni, with tremors felt as far as Karachi. According to the PMD, the first tremor struck at 9:53am and measured 3.2 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was recorded 12 kilometres north of Karachi’s Malir, at a depth of 35km.</p><small>2025-10-05 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/051909104296445.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946790/kp-cabinet-approves-withdrawal-of-false-may-9-cases-filed-by-caretaker-provincial-govt' target='_blank'><strong>KP cabinet approves withdrawal of ‘false’ May 9 cases filed by caretaker provincial govt</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet has recommended the withdrawal of several “false cases” related to the May 9, 2023 riots against supporters of the PTI, which rules the province, it emerged on Sunday.
At the time of the May 9 riots, a caretaker government with Mohammad Azam Khan as the chief minister was in power in KP, after the PTI had dissolved the provincial assembly as rifts with the Centre grew.
“For the public’s information, I want to inform that 29 false cases were registered on May 9, 2023 in anti-terrorism courts that were based on political victimisation, lack of evidence and misuse of authority,” said KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel in a video statement seen by Dawn.com.
Uthmankhel said KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur took notice of the matter as “courts had already acquitted all suspects in most of the cases”, while some suspects were discharged and some cases were sent to ordinary civil courts.
It could not be confirmed whether the cabinet had recommended withdrawing all 29 cases mentioned by the advocate general or some of them.
“This proves that all the anti-terrorism cases were illegal, unconstitutional and based on political victimisation,” he said, adding that the KP cabinet decided that the home department will withdraw the cases.

Recalling that the cabinet appointed KP Additional Advocate General (AAG) Muhammad Inam Yousafzai as the special prosecutor for the cases, Uthmankhel said Yousafzai appeared in the court and submitted an application for withdrawing the cases.
“The court examined the documents thoroughly and fixed October 15 as the next date for hearing arguments on the withdrawal.”
Uthmankhel further asserted that the cases forwarded to ordinary courts had “no testimonies either so, God willing, they will soon be ended”.
The video clip also included screenshots of letters sent by the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department to the advocate general’s office. They included a recommendation of withdrawal for a case filed in Mardan on May 9, 2023 at the City police station.
 
 

A letter dated October 3 showed that the KP cabinet wrote to its home department, saying that the matter of withdrawal was placed before the cabinet on an “urgent basis” after Uthmankhel wrote to CM Gandapur, who approved taking up the matter.
The KP cabinet also sought an implementation report on its decision on a “top priority basis”.

A response letter written by the KP home department to Uthmankhel on October 3, seen by Dawn.com, conveyed the cabinet’s approval of his recommendation to withdraw the cases.
It stated that the “KP additional chief secretary (home)/ home secretary was permitted to withdraw from the prosecution of FIR No. 833” under Section 7c (additional powers of district public prosecutor) of the KP Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions, and Powers) Act 2005, read with Section 494 (effect of withdrawal from prosecution) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The cabinet also approved the appointment of AAG Yousafzai as special prosecutor in the Mardan case.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.</p><small>2025-10-05 14:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0515024898076c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946775/landslides-and-floods-kill-64-in-nepal-india' target='_blank'><strong>Landslides and floods kill 64 in Nepal, India</strong></a><br><p>Landslides and floods triggered by heavy downpours in Nepal and neighbouring India have killed more than 60 people, officials said on Sunday, as rescue workers raced to reach cut-off communities in remote mountainous terrain.
Torrential downpours have lashed Nepal since Friday, leaving rivers in spate and many areas in the Himalayan nation inundated.
At least 44 people have died in rain-triggered disasters and five are missing, Shanti Mahat, spokeswoman for Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, told AFP.
At least 37 were killed by landslides in the worst-affected eastern district of Ilam.
“Heavy rains overnight caused the landslides,” said local district official Sunita Nepal.
“With roads blocked, some areas are difficult to reach. Rescue workers are heading there on foot.”
 


Rivers in the capital Kathmandu have also swelled, inundating settlements along their banks.
Security personnel were deployed to assist rescue efforts with helicopters and motorboats.
“There is some damage, but thanks to the authorities’ prior flood alert, we were able to move some belongings to a safe place,” said vegetable seller Rajan Khadga, 38.
Landslides have blocked several highways and disrupted flights, leaving hundreds of travellers, many returning after celebrating the Hindu festival of Dashain, stranded.
Prime Minister Sushila Karki said government agencies were “fully prepared for rescue and relief”.
“Your safety is our utmost concern. Do not hesitate to seek necessary assistance,” she said in an address, adding that the government has declared Sunday and Monday public holidays and urged people not to travel unless necessary.
Across the border in India, at least 20 people were killed in the tea-growing hill district of Darjeeling in West Bengal state after heavy overnight rain unleashed flash floods and landslides that destroyed homes and infrastructure.
“In the wake of last night’s heavy cyclone in the Darjeeling hills, over 20 people have lost their lives,” said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a lawmaker in India’s upper house.
Footage on Indian television news showed rescue workers using cables to access cut-off regions as raging waters smashed into bridges and caved in roads.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “pained by the loss of lives”.
“The situation in Darjeeling and surrounding areas is being closely monitored in the wake of heavy rains and landslides,” he said in a statement on social media.
 






India’s weather department on Sunday issued a red alert for “extremely heavy rainfall” in sub-Himalayan areas, including Darjeeling, until Monday.
Relentless downpours also swelled rivers in neighbouring Bhutan, prompting the Indian army to join rescue efforts.
Military helicopters were deployed to evacuate several civilians stranded in the border town of Phuentsholing, the army said in a statement.
Monsoon rains, usually from June to September, bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the number of fatal floods and landslides has increased in recent years.
Experts say climate change has worsened their schedule, frequency and intensity.
The Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development warned in June that communities faced heightened disaster risks this monsoon season.
“Rising temperatures and more extreme rain raise the risk of water-induced disasters such as floods, landslides, and debris flows,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-05 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05185125497a323.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946784/pension-not-charity-but-a-constitutional-right-says-justice-mansoor-ali-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Pension not charity but a constitutional right, says Justice Mansoor Ali Shah</strong></a><br><p>Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of the Supreme Court (SC) has observed in a recent judgement that an employee’s pension is not a matter of bounty, charity, or benevolence but a right protected under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution.
Article 9 entails that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with the law, while Article 14 protects the dignity of a person.
He made the remarks while hearing a petition filed by Shakeel Ahmed Kayani challenging an Islamabad High Court judgment (IHC) dated February 2, 2022, which had dismissed his plea seeking entitlement to an additional pension.
The SC heard the case on Sept 17, 2025, while the order of the judgement was released this week.
“[Pension] is inseparably linked with the right to life, dignity and livelihood, for without sustenance in old age, these rights ring hollow,” Justice Shah observed in his judgement.
According to the order, a copy of which was made available to Dawn.com today, the petitioner joined the erstwhile Oil and Gas Development Corporation established under the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Ordinance, 1961, as accounts assistant (BPS-14) on Feb 2, 1995, after earlier serving with the Pakistan Military Accounts Department Office, Wah Cantt.
During his service, the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (Reorganisation) Ordinance, 2001, was promulgated, converting the Corporation into the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited. The petitioner, by operation of law, became an employee of the company and retired as a senior accountant (E-04) on June 17, 2021, after rendering a total service of 40 years and 10 months.
The petitioner’s lawyer had argued that his client was entitled to an additional pension under Regulation 15(1A) since, as a former OGDC employee, his service terms were protected by the 2001 Ordinance. He maintained that federal government directives, such as the 2001 Finance Division memorandum discontinuing additional pensions, cannot override this statutory protection. Citing company letters from 2005 and 2010, he added that OGDC staff were not civil servants but employees of an autonomous body governed by its own regulations.
The company rejected the petitioner’s claim through an office memorandum issued on August 20, 2021. The petitioner then challenged this decision in the IHC, which dismissed the case on February 2, 2022, leading to the filing of the present petition.
In his judgement, Justice Shah added that pensions should be taken more seriously for those public servants for whom it was “a crystallised return on years of faithful service, a form of deferred wages earned through the sweat, labour, and loyalty of an employee.”
He went on to say that the concept of pension embodied the principle that those who serve must not be cast aside in their twilight years.
“To deny or withhold pension is to strip a person of the security they have justly earned, leaving them exposed to indignity, vulnerability, and want. Therefore, this right must be protected in the shape of a grant of pension that is not only adequate but also predictable.”
He further said that an element of respect and empathy is to be maintained while granting pension, which would “be in consonance with the values that Pakistan’s Constitution espouses with dignity as the highest constitutional value”.
Concluding the judgement, the judge stated in the order: “For the above reasons, we set aside the impugned judgement and declare that the petitioner is entitled to Additional Pension under Section 5 of the Ordinance, 2001 read with Regulation 15(1A) of the Pension Regulations with the direction to the Company to pay the Additional Pension to the petitioner in accordance with the Pension Regulations within 30 days from the receipt of this judgement and submit a compliance report to the Registrar of this Court.
“In case the compliance report is not received by the first week of November 2025, the case will be put up on the judicial side for necessary orders.”</p><small>2025-10-05 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05134854a270b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946766/taking-our-cover-to-settle-own-issues-with-pm-sharjeel-accuses-punjab-govt-of-conspiring-against-centre' target='_blank'><strong>‘Taking our cover to settle own issues with PM’: Sharjeel accuses Punjab govt of conspiring against Centre</strong></a><br><p>The latest accusation in the ongoing rift between the PPP and PML-N came from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday when he alleged that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Memon’s PPP and the PML-N, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
As the row continues between the two sides, Memon alleged while addressing a press conference in Karachi that on the face of it, the Punjab government was “indirectly targeting” the PPP, but their “actual target is the federal government”.
“They are taking our cover to settle their own issues with the prime minister or the federal government. Or they are trying to create an environment to [compel] us not to support the federal government, which would create problems for the federal government,” he claimed.
 






Clarifying that the PPP was supporting the federal government on specific issues and to keep the country’s “political system running”, he asserted that the circumstances that the Punjab government tried to create spoke of their intentions of creating a rift between the allies in the Centre.
“But we will not let this conspiracy of the Punjab government against the federal government succeed,” Memon asserted.
“I do not know why they have these jealousy factors,” he quipped, highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief’s recent “successful” visits to Saudi Arabia and the United States. “A person thinks that ‘maybe this should have come in my share, why is it going to the prime minister’.”
The PPP leader further said that while the chief ministers of Sindh and Balochistan usually receive the premier whenever he visits the provinces, “his own Punjab administration neither receives him nor gives him any protocol”.
“If you have any issues with the prime minister, please keep them among yourselves. Do not bring the PPP into it,” Memon said.
Regardless, the Sindh minister said, the focus at the moment should be on providing relief to the flood-hit people. “Even if you had blacked out the news from some places, but if you look on the ground […] especially in southern Punjab, the condition of the people is very bad.”
 






Memon further said: “You say we are doing politics [on the issue]. We are not doing politics. We are genuinely worried for our brothers and sisters in Punjab. Instead, those people who are even putting their pictures on boxes of biscuits are doing politics.”
He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asked the Centre to issue an appeal for international assistance and that his party had demanded that immediate flood relief be provided through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The minister pointed out that the appeal was towards the federal government but it was the Punjab government that was reacting negatively to them, despite the Centre giving the PPP “reassurances”.
South Punjab way better than any rural Sindh area: Bokhari responds
Responding to Memon in a statement, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said she accepted the Sindh minister’s challenge for a debate, with “time and venue of your choice”.
Bokhari alleged that as a foreign minister, Bilawal was “weakening the roots of the federal government, including his party, and the prime minister”. “The house where a father and son do not agree are now trying to hide their sins by making futile taunts against our house.”
She further said that the PPP was “conspiring” against both the Centre and the Punjab government. “You start playing the ‘province card’ when your own performance is questioned,” the information minister said.
 
 

Bokhari asserted that south Punjab was still “way better and developed than any area of rural Sindh”. “Who are you to order Punjab?” she asked.
The minister also took exception to the PPP highlighting water right issues “day and night but telling us that Punjab will use water as per your (Sindh’s) wishes”.
Assailing the PPP for “delayed” work, Bokhari said: “You are still selling the 2002 floods, [while] cheques have started being distributed in areas where surveys have been completed.”
In a post on X, Bokhari said Memon was “more worried about interfering into Punjab’s political and administrative issues because they have decided not to do any work in Sindh”.
“Saying things is easy. Do work if there is. See your conditions; our south Punjab is better than them in every way. Is there any shame?” Bokhari added.
 






Both parties have been engaged in a social media contest today, with the PPP sharing complaints from purported flood-affected people from Punjab and the PML-N countering those by sharing interviews lauding its provincial government.
 






Memon assails Punjab-backed campaign to support vlogger’s anti-Sindh remarks
Memon also indirectly referred to the remarks made last month by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, whose content aired on national electronic media was decried as hate speech against the Sindhi community and led to a war of words between the coalition partners.
 
 

While a Senate committee had grilled Razi for making the derogatory remarks and the PTV had terminated his services, CM Maryam openly came out in support of the vlogger, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
During his media briefing, Memon alleged that the Punjab government “staged another drama to divert from this entire matter (of floods), which is extremely unfortunate, damaging, and I think it was handled in a very childish manner”.
Detailing the sequence of events without naming Razi, the PPP leader said the Senate panel’s proceedings were still ongoing when a “campaign strongly in his favour” was launched from the social media accounts of the Punjab government and some of its top ministers.
 


Recalling that Maryam had “urged that the person be forgiven as he had apologised”, Memon questioned how the country’s anti-hate speech and electronic media laws would be implemented if people were to be let go in this manner.
“If you are giving these examples, then release all the people that are sitting in your  jails across Punjab,” he said.
“However, I would say that she is not at fault. Her scriptwriter is leading her onto the wrong path […] and advises her to run campaigns […] Remember a ‘Vote Ko Izzat Do’ campaign was run once, and very good respect was also given,” Memon quipped.
The PPP minister affirmed that whether it was a Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashtun or from any other community, “all live like brothers and respect each other”.

On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon.
Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years.
 
 

“The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said.
The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added.
“They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read.
According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”.
They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects.
“The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said.
From Gaza invasion to Trump’s plan
Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
After multiple attempts to mediate a truce between Palestine’s Hamas and  Israeli, a significant development came last month when Trump engaged eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to end the onslaught in Gaza.
Merely days later, the White House revealed the US president’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Simultaneously, Trump held a meeting with the Israeli prime minister and held a press conference alongside him, announcing his agreement to the proposal.
 
 

But, some Muslim countries engaged on the matter have said that Trump’s plan was not the one they originally agreed to.
Meanwhile, US news outlet Axios reported that the deal now before Hamas was significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
 
 

On Monday, Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas following which Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal or meet “a very sad end”.
Later, he gave Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian resistance group would face “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms.
On Friday, Hamas — which had not been included in negotiations about the proposal — said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza invasion, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.
Yesterday, Trump called on Israel to stop bombing Gaza immediately and he believes Hamas was ready for peace. However, reports of bombing in Gaza continue to come.</p><small>2025-10-05 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0517223019c31ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946783/soldier-martyred-another-injured-by-unknown-assailants-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Soldier martyred, another injured by unknown assailants in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>A soldier was martyred and another injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, according to the police.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Spokesperson for Bannu Police Kashif Nawaz told Dawn.com, “A security personnel was killed and another was injured when they were attacked by unknown assailants near the Ayub fuel station on Miranshah road.”
He added that the body and the injured were rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital in Bannu, while a police team was dispatched to the site of the incident to collect information.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
Last month, a police constable was shot dead by unknown assailants in Bannu while he was on his way to work.  On September 2, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in Bannu.
According to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Indian sponsored kharjis (seceders) attempted to breach the perimeter security; however, “their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response of the Pakistani troops.”
In August, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.</p><small>2025-10-05 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0517050113c30dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946786/demolishing-new-yorks-roosevelt-hotel-to-build-skyscraper-an-option-for-pakistan-report' target='_blank'><strong>Demolishing New York’s Roosevelt Hotel to build skyscraper an option for Pakistan: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is considering options for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, including demolishing the building, as part of its efforts to meet commitments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), US outlet Bloomberg reported on Saturday.
Named after former US president Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
As part of its $7 billion IMF loan agreement, the government approved a “transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel” in July, saying it would not conduct an outright sale but decided to adopt a joint venture model to maximise long-term value.
Muhammad Ali, the adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, told Bloomberg that one of the options is to raze the storied landmark and build a skyscraper in its place.
“The government is keen on a joint venture where Pakistan will contribute the land and the partner will bring in the equity,” he told Bloomberg in Islamabad. “The other option is to retain the hotel if it makes economic sense.
“We will have clarity on this in the next few months after finalisation of the JV partner and market sounding,” Ali said.
 
 

The federal government is making an effort to restructure or privatise state-owned enterprises as committed to the IMF under the terms of the $7bn loan agreement, Bloomberg reported.
“The first asset to be sold could be PIA (Pakistan International Airlines), which has been surviving on periodic bailouts that the government can no longer afford,” the outlet added. “The adviser is hopeful that the national carrier will be sold by November.”
Ali also said that the groups interested in buying PIA are among the largest business groups in the country and have the capacity to run it, according to Bloomberg. He estimated that an investment of about half a billion dollars would be needed to turn the airline around.
“Pakistan is in the process of appointing advisers for the hotel transaction, dubbed by some as “the new Ellis Island” for its historical role as a migrant intake point,” the outlet reported.
“The government will finalise a new adviser later this month after bids from seven groups, including Citigroup Inc, CBRE Group Inc, and Savills PLC.”
PIA posted a pre-tax profit in the first half of 2025, which a company source said is its first such for the period in about two decades, ahead of a planned sale of the national carrier later this year.</p><small>2025-10-05 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627068-sharjeel-memon-dares-punjab-ministers-to-debate-says-ppp-being-used-to-target-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Sharjeel Memon dares Punjab ministers to debate, says PPP being used to target Centre</strong></a><br><p>

Officers were called to the incident at the mosque in the south coast town of Peacehaven late on Saturday.
No one was injured, but the blaze caused damage to the mosque’s front entrance and a vehicle parked outside.
According to a statement from Sussex Police, emergency services were called to the fire at the building in Phyllis Avenue at about 9.50pm UK time on Saturday (1:50am PKT, Sunday).
 






“This is a fast-moving investigation, and we are urging anyone with relevant information to report it to us. This includes anyone with CCTV, Ring Doorbell, dashcam, and mobile phone footage in the area at the time,” Sussex Police Detective Superintendent Karrie Bohanna said in the statement.
“We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result.
“There is already an increased police presence at the scene, and there are also additional patrols taking place to provide reassurance at other places of worship across the county.”
Bohanna added that the Sussex Police had a “zero-tolerance approach to hate crime”, adding there was no place for hate across the county.
A volunteer working at the mosque, who chose not to be named, told the BBC that “two people tried to enter through the front door, only to find it locked.”
“They then poured a liquid at the entrance and near a car parked outside, which was set alight. It could have been murder,” the man said.
He added that two people inside the mosque managed to escape, per the report.
Member of the Scottish Parliament and ex-first minister Humza Yousaf said in a post on X that such incidents were taking place because all Muslims were blamed for the actions of a few extremists.
“We warned you. Many politicians & media outlets have put a target on every Muslim’s back by blaming all of us, and Islam, for the horrific Synagogue attack,” he said.
“Thursday’s attack was the actions of one deranged extremist. This is what happens when you blame an entire community.”
 






The fire follows Thursday’s attack on a synagogue in northern Manchester in which two people died and three others were seriously injured.
British police later they accidentally shot a victim, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt.
The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0516141753686ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946763/trump-authorises-troops-to-chicago-as-judge-blocks-portland-deployment' target='_blank'><strong>Trump authorises troops to Chicago as judge blocks Portland deployment</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump authorised the deployment of troops to Chicago after a federal agent shot an allegedly armed motorist there on Saturday. At the same time, a judge blocked the Republican leader’s attempt to send the military into Portland, another Democratic-run city.
The escalating crisis across the country pits Trump’s increasingly militarised anti-crime and migration crackdown against opposition Democrats who accuse him of an authoritarian power grab.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement that “President Trump has authorised 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago. This comes after weeks of Republican threats to send troops to the Midwestern city over the wishes of local leaders.
“President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.”
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin called the move a “shameful chapter in our nation’s history”, adding that the “president is not intent on fighting crime. He is intent on spreading fear.”
 






Chicago and Portland are the latest flashpoints in the Trump administration’s rollout of raids, following the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and Washington.
The raids have seen groups of masked, armed men in unmarked cars and armoured vehicles target residential neighbourhoods and businesses, sparking protests.
Trump has repeatedly called Portland “war-ravaged” and riddled with violent crime, but in Saturday’s court order, US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote “the President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.”
Although the city has seen scattered attacks on federal officers and property, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate “that those episodes of violence were part of an organised attempt to overthrow the government as a whole,” Immergut wrote in granting a temporary restraining order.
Protests in Portland did not pose a “danger of rebellion,” and “regular law enforcement forces” could handle such incidents, Immergut said.
Oregon Senator Ron Wyden applauded the order, saying the “victory supports what Oregonians already know: we don’t need or want Donald Trump to provoke violence by deploying federal troops in our state.”
 






White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on social media that the judge’s order was “legal insurrection” and accused local leaders in Oregon of conducting an “organised terrorist attack on the federal government.”
 






‘Operation Midway Blitz’
Earlier on Saturday, a federal officer in Chicago shot a motorist after law enforcement agents were “boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.
“Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,” she said.
AFP could not independently verify the DHS version of the event.
The agency said the motorist “drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” but Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Merritt told the Sun-Times newspaper that she was found in fair condition and taken to a local hospital.
McLaughlin also accused Chicago police of “leaving the shooting scene” with officers refusing “to assist us in securing the area”.
Chicago police told local broadcaster Fox 32 that officers responded to the scene, but the department “is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting.”
Following the shooting, protesters who had gathered, chanting “ICE go home!” were met with tear gas and pepper balls, temporarily dispersing before returning, the Sun-Times reported.
Protesters left after federal agents vacated the scene.
 


Trump’s “Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in Chicago last month, and Saturday’s shooting is not the first time federal agents have opened fire.
Department of Homeland Security officials said ICE officers shot and killed 38-year-old immigrant Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a traffic stop on September 12, accusing him of allegedly trying to flee the scene and dragging an ICE officer with the vehicle.</p><small>2025-10-05 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627063-kp-govt-withdraws-may-9-cases-against-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt withdraws May 9 vandalism cases against PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>

Leo, the first US pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter’s Square that immigrants should not be treated with “the coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination”.
The pope, who did not single out any country for its treatment of migrants, called on Catholics to “open our arms and hearts to them, welcoming them as brothers and sisters, and being for them a presence of consolation and hope.”
Pope talks of ‘new missionary age’
Leo had criticised the Trump administration’s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church’s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.
On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing “a new missionary age” in which it was tasked with offering “hospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity” to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.
“In the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world’s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,” he said.
Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticised the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.
Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church’s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05140554390a921.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946767/boy-hospitalised-in-thailand-after-attack-by-escaped-lion' target='_blank'><strong>Boy hospitalised in Thailand after attack by escaped lion</strong></a><br><p>A lion kept at a private home in Thailand got loose and attacked a young boy, leaving him in hospital, the wildlife department said Sunday.
The lion attacked the child, who was hospitalised with unspecified injuries, while he was walking on a public road Saturday night in western Kanchanaburi province, about a two-hour drive from the capital Bangkok, the department said in a statement.
Local media said the boy was on his way home from playing with other children when the big cat pounced on him.
Lion ownership is legal in Thailand, where the captive population has exploded in recent years, with nearly 500 registered in zoos, breeding farms, petting cafes and homes.
But experts have warned the trend endangers animals and humans, and likely fuels illicit trade domestically and abroad.
The lion’s owner, who the wildlife department identified only as Parinya, was charged with violating wildlife protection laws and faces up to six months in prison and a 50,000 baht ($1,500) fine if convicted.
The lion was seized by authorities, the department said, adding that a wildlife breeding centre had prepared a new home for it.
Parinya told local TV he was “shocked” when he learned of the attack, saying the female lion got loose after it was removed from its cage while it was being renovated.
“I apologise for what happened, it was an accident,” he said, adding that he will pay compensation and for the boy’s medical treatment.
In its statement, the wildlife department urged people who “keep wild animals to be aware of the potential dangers, as all animals have a ferocious instinct”.
“Any unforeseen incident that affects the life and property of others will be punished and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” it added.
Since 2022, Thai law has required owners to register and microchip lions, and inform authorities before moving them, but there are few enclosure or welfare requirements.
Last month, a zookeeper was mauled to death by several lions at a safari park on the outskirts of Bangkok, raising scrutiny of the facility, which offers lion- and tiger-feeding trips for about $40 per person.</p><small>2025-10-05 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627048-pakistan-mulls-razing-roosevelt-hotel-to-build-skyscraper' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan mulls 'razing Roosevelt Hotel to build skyscraper'</strong></a><br><p>

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
According to an official statement by a Suparco spokesperson, the first supermoon will occur at 8:47pm PKT on Tuesday, rising in the east just after sunset and setting in the west just before dawn.
“This year, the October 7 supermoon will be at a distance of 224,599 miles (about 361,457 kilometres) from Earth, making it 6.6pc larger and 13pc brighter than an average full moon,” the statement said.
This supermoon will appear close to the planet Saturn, which can be spotted west of the Moon on Monday and Tuesday evening.
It added that the brightest supermoon of the year is expected to occur in November, when the moon will be 221,817 miles (about 356,980 km) away.
The phenomenon will be visible not just in Pakistan but across the globe, offering a “breathtaking sight” in the night sky. Following this, two more supermoons will be visible on November 5 and December 5.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.
In August of 2023, a once-in-a-decade “super blue Moon” lit up the sky, with “blue” simply referring to a full moon seen twice in the same month.</p><small>2025-10-05 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627045-four-indian-proxy-terrorists-killed-in-clash-with-locals-in-balochistans-korki-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian proxy terrorists killed in clash with locals in Balochistan's Korki: sources</strong></a><br><p>

However, the differences are starker once a person starts to peel back the surface of the women’s game in both countries.
On one hand, we have players from across the border who have opportunities like the Women’s Premier League available, where compensation reaches upwards of $400,000 for the highest-paid players.
On the other hand, barring a few players in the national side and those who make it to final rosters of a handful of cricket leagues worldwide — Pakistani domestic women cricketers’ monthly retainers were even less than the government-mandated minimum wage this year.
To say that the gulf in resources available to both teams is large would be an understatement of the century.
 






Furthermore, in yet another familiar scenario at the start of an ICC tournament, the Indian team is going into the encounter with a win against co-hosts Sri Lanka, while Pakistan have lost to Bangladesh in their opening encounter — a side they had beaten with ease in the Qualifiers in April.
However, the Pakistan skipper was at her usual jovial best at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, seemingly putting last match’s result behind her.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in men’s Asia Cup encounters from last month, she made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
“Obviously, our main goal is to play, and when we come here, our focus is only on the game … whatever comes in the spirit of the game, we try to maintain that,” Fatima said.
 






She also touched upon moments of camaraderie between the two sides, like the last World Cup encounter in New Zealand, where Indian players had playfully interacted with Bismah Maroof’s newborn baby, Fatima.
The Indian skipper, Kaur, however, could not give her take as the Indian management chose to send the bowling coach Aavishkar Salvi to the pre-match presser.
When asked about the bitterness from the men’s encounters disrupting the relationships of the players here as well, Salvi never got the chance to answer as the question was deemed too political for the presser.
Pakistan’s chances of making it to the next stage might have been further hampered by Saturday’s result in Colombo, where a rained-out fixture meant both Sri Lanka and Australia shared a point each.
 
 

This would make Fatima’s aim of finishing in the top four more difficult, as the extra point that Sri Lanka got in this match could be the difference between making the cut or not.
The square, which has remained under the covers throughout the day with rain pouring down means both sides’ pacers will be rearing to go early in the innings.
Bowlers to look out for would be Pakistan’s Diana Baig, who goes into the encounter with decent bowling rhythm, and Indian off-spinner Sneh Rana who is the second-highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year.
“Everyone knows that she’s one of our best players. She’s a good bowler and also a very good fielder. So it definitely boosts our team as well,” Fatima said of Diana’s encouraging performance in the opening encounter.
Echoing her remarks after the Bangladesh loss, Fatima said the toss or conditions would not be that important as the pitch remained the same for both sides throughout.
“The pitch doesn’t matter much; all we have to do is play good cricket after assessing the conditions.”
With rain predicted for Sunday as well, there is a glimmer of hope for the Green Shirts as a washed-out encounter or one curtailed by the downpour could tip the odds in their favour.
Their record against India across 11 One-day Internationals is an unenviable one — never once winning a tie, but across T20Is, there is still a better record to boast about.
The women’s side have beaten India on three occasions in the format — with their first win in a World Cup coming back in 2012 — nine years before the men’s side achieved that feat.
Speaking about the ODI record, the Pakistani skipper said: “Records are meant to be broken, we won’t go on past histories, but will take the match on the day and try to execute our plans.”
Fatima and co. would have to channel their best in the field to add another win to that tally — and maybe the rain clouds in the Sri Lankan capital might have a silver lining for the Women in Green.

The cryptocurrency reached $125,689, shooting above its previous August record of around $124,500.
Bitcoin has enjoyed a strong upward momentum, with investors cautious about the United States’ government shutdown.
Gains in US shares have also supported bitcoin’s rise, while investors have looked to safe haven assets while US lawmakers negotiate over funding the federal government, Bloomberg News said.
US President Donald Trump and his family have also been big promoters of cryptocurrencies and are involved in various crypto endeavours that have inflated his wealth.
 
 

Trump’s embrace of digital assets has reversed years of US government scepticism towards the crypto industry under his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, with the US House of Representatives passing three landmark cryptocurrency bills in July.
These regulatory changes have seen the value of bitcoin soar.
“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all-time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefiting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05112004525f1ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946752/failed-attempt-at-restoring-lost-reputation-khawaja-asif-reacts-to-indian-military-political-leaderships-statements' target='_blank'><strong>Failed attempt at restoring lost reputation: Khawaja Asif reacts to Indian military, political leadership’s statements</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday reacted to statements made by the Indian military and political leadership, terming them a “failed attempt” to restore their “lost reputation”.
While he did not specify any particular statement that he was reacting to, his remarks follow recent aggressive comments from the Indian side, mentioning terrorism and warning of action. India has long accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, an allegation that Islamabad has repeatedly refuted and termed baseless.
“The statements made by the Indian army and its political leadership are a failed attempt to restore its lost reputation,” Asif said on X.
 






He also referred to a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May, during which Islamabad says it downed at least six Indian jets.
Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the escalation,  and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”.
“The way the public opinion in India turned against the government after the worst defeat in history, and the way [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his group have lost their reputation, it is apparent from their statements that they [are feeling] the pressure,” Asif added.
 
 

“This time, God willing, India will get buried under the rubble of its own jets,” the minister asserted.
‘Cataclysmic devastation’
Asif’s remarks come a day after the military warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Pakistan would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) came in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in case of a fresh round of hostilities.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” the ISPR said.
Indian media outlet NDTV reported on Friday that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
 
 

The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In response, the ISPR said in its statement that the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
May conflict
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
 
 

In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0508060254a336e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946705/14-terrorists-killed-in-khuzdar-operation' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in Khuzdar operation</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday.
The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil.
According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.
“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.
The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.
 
 

They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.
“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.
Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.
On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.
The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.
Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.
FIR registered
Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.
Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.
According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.
 
 

Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.
Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.
“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.
 
 

Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.
The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.
Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.

Those detained by Israel also include former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
“Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health,” the FO statement said.
It added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”
 






The FO said it had previously, too, coordinated the safe return of individuals who disembarked earlier. “In this context, we express our profound gratitude to the brotherly countries that assisted in the repatriation of our citizens.”
It further stated that the government “remains committed to the protection of all its citizens abroad and anticipates the completion of this repatriation process within the coming days”.
Several pro-Palestinian activists, former senator Mushtaq and Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thun­b­erg, were captured by Isra­eli troops that intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla on Wednesday night.
 
 

Detained Pakistanis also included Mazhar Saeed Shah, Wajahat Ahmad, Dr Osama Riaz, Ismail Khan, Syed Aziz Nizami and Fahad Ishtiaq, according to an earlier statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In a telephone conversation with JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman on Friday, PM Shehbaz had assured him that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including the ex-senator.
Flotilla’s interception and detainees ‘mistreated’
The Global Sumud Flotilla had begun its journey last month, with Mushtaq leading the Pakistani delegation on the voyage.
As the fleet moved closer to the territorial waters of Gaza, Israeli forces began intercepting it on the night of October 1, halting over 40 boats part of the flotilla by the next day.
The Israeli troops were filmed boarding and holding activists from several vessels at gunpoint. The flotilla’s organisers had equipped each boat with cameras livestreaming every minute of their voyage as a security measure against just such an occurrence.
After intercepting the flotilla, Israel said it would deport the activists to Europe, without specifying which countries they would be sent to.
The Israeli action drew condemnations from across the globe, with countries whose citizens were detained expressing concern.
According to a report by The Guardian, Thunberg told Swedish officials she was subjected to harsh treatment in Israeli custody after her removal from the Global Sumud Flotilla.
 
 

As per an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by The Guardian, an official who visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.
At least four flotilla activists also said Thunberg was mistreated during her detention, with two members saying she was forced to hold an Israeli flag.</p><small>2025-10-05 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627029-pakistan-seeking-repatriation-of-citizens-detained-by-israel-in-gaza-aid-flotilla-interception-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad seeking repatriation of citizens detained by Israel in Gaza aid flotilla interception: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club.
A joint action committee has been formed that includes all key media associations and various factions of the NPC.
In its first meeting headed by the acting NPC president Ehteshamul Haq, the action committee was given the mandate to prepare a charter of demands.
The chairmanship of the committee was unanimously handed over to NPC President Azhar Jatoi, while Nayar Ali was given the responsibility of its secretary.
 
 

The committee members include President PFUJ Afzal Butt, President RIUJ Tariq Virk, President PFUJ (Dastur) Haji Nawaz Raza, President RIUJ (Dastur) Rana Kausar Ali, President PFUJ (Workers) Sadia Kamal and Javed Malik, Secretary General PFUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Shakeel Ahmed, President RIUJ (Rana Azeem Group) Tariq Usmani, President Azad Group Shakeel Qarar and Mehboobur Rehman Tanoli, President Parliamentary Reporters Association M.B. Soomro and General Secretary Naveed Akbar.
The members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future.
Meanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised.
“The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added.
The leader of Azad Panel Shakeel Qarar said: “We have suggested that a notification be issued to the federal and provincial governments that in future the police or any law enforcement agency will not be allowed to enter any press club even after prior permission.”
He added that an inquiry should be conducted by an officer of interior ministry and people from the ruling and opposition parties.

• MP Iqbal Mohamed defends such marriages as culturally significant, urges genetic screening over bans
LONDON: Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has found itself at the centre of a political and cultural row after a government-backed education programme published — and then quietly removed — online guidance describing the potential benefits of first-cousin marriage.
UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the advice “shocking” and demanded an apology, saying first-cousin marriages are “high-risk and unsafe.” MP Iqbal Mohamed, however, defended such unions as culturally significant for many families.
Speaking in the Commons, he acknowledged health risks but said many families see such unions as positive for building bonds and financial security, urging genetic screening instead of a ban.
 
 

The document, published by NHS England’s Genomics Education Programme last week, stated that consanguineous unions can bring “stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages” even as it acknowledged the increased risk of certain genetic conditions among children of related parents.
Tory MP Richard Holden, who has proposed legislation to ban cousin marriages, condemned the document, calling on the NHS to “stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” Holden also linked cousin marriage to immigration and women’s rights, saying the practice “should be ended for good.”
By Monday September 29, the guidance appeared to have been taken down from the NHS website.
New YouGov research shows that three quarters of Britons (77 per cent) say first cousin marriage should not be legal, with only 9pc thinking the law should remain as it is. Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.
The study
The Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.
The document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.
It noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”
The guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.
It further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.
In February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.
The Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.
Professor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.
He said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”
But the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.
Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.
Prof Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.
BBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.

• India may release over 150,000 cusecs of water into Punjab rivers within 48 hours
• PDMA warns of potential flooding in some regions
• Survey of flood damage in 69 tehsils likely to be complete by 27th
LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre for compensation of crop losses, with the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) warning of potential flooding in some regions amid rain forecast for many districts and expected release of over 150,000 cusecs from India into the Chenab, Sutlej and Ravi rivers within a day or two.
While chairing a meeting in Multan to review the condition of cotton, rice, sugarcane and other standing crops, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said about 2,000 teams were conducting surveys of flood-related damages, though Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had already approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre to compensate for crop losses.
He said a comprehensive action plan had also been prepared to achieve wheat sowing target, noting that measures aimed at boosting cotton production had yielded encouraging results. So far, he said, 2.65 million bales equivalent of seed cotton (phutti) were picked this year as compared to 1.846m bales obtained during the same period last year according to Crop Reporting Service statistics.
 
 

Earlier, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an alert for rains in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan over the next 12 to 24 hours, specifically in the upper catchment areas of Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
On the other hand, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told a presser that the country was bracing for a shift in the weather, with rains expected over the next few days which may worsen the flood situation in Punjab.
Light to heavy rains are expected in various districts of Punjab from Rawalpindi to Lahore over the weekend, followed by showers on Monday in south Punjab. In the upper regions of Punjab, up to 100mm of rainfall was expected, he added.
Rising level of river waters
At Head Marala, Mr Kathia said, the Chenab River is carrying 20,000 cusecs, with an additional 100,000 cusecs expected from India in the next 48 hours. Marala’s current outflow is 23,000 cusecs. Considering that 900,000 cusecs water passed through Head Marala on Aug 26, he said it was not as big a challenge.
Besides, the Sutlej River may receive 50,000 cusecs from India, and 35,000 cusecs of water are expected to enter the Ravi River from the Thein Dam, he said.
On the other hand, Mangla Dam reported high water levels, though Jhelum may not face a massive flood situation.
Survey in 27 districts
The PDMA DG said a survey for flood damage assessment was underway in 27 districts of Punjab, with as many as 11,000 people being engaged in the exercise. A joint survey team includes officers from the Pakistan Army, district administration, and various other departments, he said, adding that a total of 2,213 teams were in the field.
With real-time monitoring through an online dashboard, survey is being conducted by the joint teams in 27 districts, he said. The exercise would be completed in 69 tehsils by Oct 27, he added.
 
 

Mr Kathia said the Bank of Punjab would establish counters in each tehsil to ensure provision of maximum facilities to flood victims. He said that flood survivors could receive Rs50,000 immediately after receiving cards.
Complaint resolution
For complaints related to the survey, he said, the PDMA in collaboration with Punjab’s IT Board had formed a platform, which would resolve complaints within seven days.
The DG recalled that there were over 350,000 flood victims in 2010, 38,196 in 2012, 359,000 in 2014 while a total of Rs14 billion was distributed among them.
Again in 2022, he said, 56,000 people affected by floods were provided a sum of Rs10 billion compensation.
He said that over the past 15 years, Rs51 billion was distributed among flood victims but the damage from the current flood was bigger than all previous floods.
Weather advisory

The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues.
“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues.

Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today

“Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.”
However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters.
The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue).
Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her.
However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues.
As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”.
PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab.
“The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked.
PM’s Malaysia visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added.
A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.
