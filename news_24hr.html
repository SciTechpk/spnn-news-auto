Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from Central, South and Southeast Asia and the Middle East in a show of Global South solidarity.
“We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi told Xi during the meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a video clip posted on the Indian leader’s official X account.
 


The bilateral meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods due to New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. Analysts say Xi and Modi are looking to present a united front against Western pressure.
Modi said an atmosphere of “peace and stability” has been created on their disputed Himalayan border, the site of a prolonged military standoff after deadly troop clashes in 2020, which froze most areas of cooperation between the nuclear-armed strategic rivals.
He added that an agreement had been reached between both nations regarding border management, without giving details.
“We must … not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,” Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported Xi as saying.
China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added.
The bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery.
Security guards positioned themselves around and inside the venue, their eyes scanning reporters and guests carefully, as Chinese diplomats hurried through the halls.
Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic, with a significant police presence deployed around the city.
Official posters promoting the SCO lined the streets, displaying words such as “mutual benefit” and “equality” written in Chinese and Russian.
Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington.
 
 

Direct flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are “being resumed”, Modi added, without providing a timeframe.
China had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilisers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
China opposes Washington’s steep tariffs on India and will “firmly stand with India”, Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month.
For decades, Washington painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi in the hope that it would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing.
In recent months, China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Buddhist sites in Tibet, and both countries have lifted reciprocal tourist visa restrictions.
“Both India and China are engaged in what is likely to be a lengthy and fraught process of defining a new equilibrium in the relationship,” said Manoj Kewalramani, a Sino-Indian relations expert at the Takshashila Institution think tank in Bengaluru.
However, other long-term irritants remain in the relationship.
 
 

China is India’s largest bilateral trade partner, but the long-running trade deficit — a persistent source of frustration for Indian officials — reached a record $99.2 billion this year.
Meanwhile, a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet has sparked fears of mass water diversion that could reduce water flows on the major Brahmaputra River by up to 85pc in the dry season, according to Indian government estimates.
India also hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader whom Beijing views as a dangerous separatist influence. Pakistan, with which India had a brief military conflict in May, also benefits from staunch Chinese economic, diplomatic and military support.
Talks on the sidelines
The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
More than 20 leaders, including Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, are attending the bloc’s largest meeting since its founding in 2001.
Putin is expected to hold talks on Monday with Erdogan and Pezeshkian about the Ukraine conflict and Tehran’s nuclear programme, respectively.
 
 

The Russian president needs “all the benefits of SCO as a player on the world stage and also the support of the second largest economy in the world”, said Lim Tai Wei, a professor and East Asia expert at Japan’s Soka University.
“Russia is also keen to win over India, and India’s trade frictions with the United States presents this opportunity,” Lim told AFP.
Many of the assembled leaders will be in Beijing on Wednesday to witness the military parade, which will also be attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Xi yesterday began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly.
China and Russia have used the SCO — sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated Nato military alliance — to deepen ties with Central Asian states.</p><small>2025-08-31 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3115571405dc4e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938676/explosion-partially-damages-girls-primary-school-in-kps-lakki-marwat-no-casualties-reported' target='_blank'><strong>Explosion partially damages girls’ primary school in KP’s Lakki Marwat; no casualties reported</strong></a><br><p>An explosion at a girls’ primary school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building, though no casualties were reported, police said on Sunday.
District Police Officer (DPO) Nazeer Khan told Dawn.com: “The incident took place late Saturday night when an explosion occurred at a girl’s primary school in the Wanda Zahid Gul area, situated within the jurisdiction of Daddiwala Police Station.”
He said that due to the explosion, carried out through an improvised explosive device (IED), the school’s building was partially damaged.
“Luckily, no casualties were reported,” the DPO said, adding that a heavy contingent of police had been deployed in the area.
DPO Khan further said that there were two IEDs planted in the school.
“One of the IEDs exploded, while the other one was discovered when the police reached the incident site and carried out an inspection,” he said. “It was successfully defused by the bomb disposal squad.”
A search operation was underway in the district to locate the perpetrators, according to the DPO.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.
Earlier this month, terrorists carried out a series of militant attacks across the district, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.
On August 13, police said that terrorists blew up a gas pipeline in Lakki Marwat district, resulting in a suspension of gas supply to Punjab.</p><small>2025-08-31 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/311452382a084ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938669/kps-cabinet-committee-on-legislation-approves-historic-kalash-marriage-bill' target='_blank'><strong>KP’s cabinet committee on legislation approves ‘historic’ Kalash marriage bill</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cabinet Committee on Legislation on Sunday approved the draft of the “historic” Kalash Marriage Bill, clearing its path to be presented before the KP Provincial Assembly for ratification and enactment into law.
The Kalash are a unique, indigenous people living in the remote Chitral valleys of northern Pakistan, known for their distinct ancient Indo-Aryan culture, polytheistic religion (a form of animism), unique language and vibrant festivals.
“After approval from the Cabinet Committee on Legislation, the Kalash Marriage bill is now poised for presentation in the upcoming meeting of the provincial cabinet for tabling in the KP Assembly for voting,” said Qamar Naseem, programme manager at Blue Viens and co-drafter of the legal document.
“This initiative represents a significant step toward acknowledging and safeguarding the rights of Pakistan’s indigenous peoples,” he commented.
Naseem appreciated the government for its commitment and cooperation in moving forward with this historic legislation.
 
 

He also thanked Wazirzada, focal person to the KP chief minister on minority issues; the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR); the Local Government Department; and all those who provided their support in drafting the bill and its passage from different government offices.
He observed that this landmark legislation will provide the Kalash community with indispensable legal protection and a formal registration system for their marriages, respecting their cultural and religious identity.
“It is not only a legal reform but also a recognition of their fundamental rights,” he added.
For generations, the Kalash people have lived in the valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir in Chitral, maintaining their distinct identity through unique religious beliefs, festivals, rituals, and traditions.
 
 

Despite their rich heritage and global recognition, the community has long been deprived of a formal legal framework to protect its social and cultural rights.
Marriage registration has been one of the most pressing gaps, with Kalash couples lacking a system to officially record their unions, resulting in legal and social complications.
The Kalash Marriage Bill addresses this historic omission. It introduces a legal mechanism for the registration of marriages in accordance with Kalash religious values and customary practices, thereby ensuring both cultural preservation and legal recognition.
“The progress of the Kalash Marriage Bill marks a turning point for the Kalash people, setting the stage for their cultural traditions to be formally respected and legally recognised within Pakistan’s legislative framework,” Naseem said.</p><small>2025-08-31 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/31150421a630ed4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938671/indonesia-leader-says-some-protests-leaning-towards-treason-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia leader says some protests ‘leaning towards treason, terrorism’</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday spoke out against protests over economic conditions and inequality, saying some actions in rallies that have spread across the country in recent days amounted to treason and terrorism.
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy was rocked by protests in major cities, including the capital Jakarta, in recent days after footage spread of a motorcycle taxi driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle at an earlier rally against perks for lawmakers.
“The rights to peaceful assembly should be respected and protected. But we cannot deny that there are signs of actions outside the law, even against the law, even leaning towards treason and terrorism,” Prabowo said in a speech in Jakarta.
He said protests should take place peacefully, and if people destroyed public facilities or looted private homes, “the state must step in to protect its citizens”.
 


His comments come after the house of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati was looted overnight, with soldiers guarding her residence, a witness told AFP on Sunday.
Anger has spread to lawmakers, and several have reportedly had their houses ransacked in recent days.
The grievances of protesters are many, but rallies this week focused on the revelation that lawmakers were receiving a housing allowance nearly 10 times higher than the minimum wage in Jakarta.
At least three people were killed after a fire started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar.
Two workers died at the scene, and a third person, a civil servant, died in hospital.
Crowds were seen cheering and clapping as flames engulfed the building, with few security forces in sight.
Major test
Protests have spread to other major cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.
On Saturday, a local council building was burned on the island of Lombok, while a police headquarters in the eastern Javan city of Surabaya was set on fire.
The protests are the biggest and most violent of Prabowo’s presidency, a key test for the ex-general less than a year into his rule.
He pledged an investigation into the killing of motorcycle gig driver Affan Kurniawan and promised to help his family. Seven officers in the tactical van were detained for further investigation.
The crisis has forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China next week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II in order to monitor the situation.
Prabowo has pledged fast, state-driven growth, but has already faced protests against widespread government budget cuts.
In response to the protests, social media app TikTok said on Saturday it had temporarily suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100 million users.</p><small>2025-08-31 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/311517308980061.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938672/at-least-5-killed-in-rain-related-incidents-across-kp-over-last-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>At least 5 killed in rain-related incidents across KP over last 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>Monsoon rains across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have claimed the lives of five people — four of them children — and injured another five over the last 24 hours, according to a KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority’s report.
Heavy rains continue to lash parts of KP as it reels from catastrophic floods that ravaged the province earlier this month, leaving 406 dead in its wake.
On August 30, the provincial capital Peshawar received 41 millimetres of rain, whereas heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in Khyber district also swelled the Budni and other nullahs, submerging low-lying areas along Warsak Road, Safia Town, Regi Model Town and Nasir Bagh, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
As per the KP PDMA report, as a result of the rain, “two were reported dead in Peshawar — both children — including a child who was swept away by a flash flood and another three-month-old infant who died as a result of a roof collapse incident.”
Five people sustained injuries in separate infrastructure collapse incidents.
Meanwhile, heavy rain in upper South Waziristan claimed the lives of three people from the same family after the roof of their house collapsed. The dead include two children and a woman.
According to the PDMA report, a total of six houses have been damaged due to rain and urban flooding, including three that were destroyed completely.
In a statement, the PDMA spokesperson said, “PDMA has directed respective district administrations to intensify relief efforts and ensure timely assistance to victims.”
“PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre is fully functional,” the spokesperson added, urging people to contact PDMA’s helpline at 1700 in case of emergency or weather updates.
According to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.
The latest data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) showed that at least 853 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-31 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621196-president-zardari-gives-assent-to-anti-terrorism-amendment-bill' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari gives assent to anti-terrorism amendment bill</strong></a><br><p>

Currency experts have warned that administrative measures aimed at supporting the rupee may backfire, especially in the face of unforeseen events such as the recent flood devastation across the country.
Despite the growing demand for dollars and a reduction in supply, the rupee has managed to appreciate since the government crackdown and stricter monitoring in July. However, experts believe that the current trend could be unsustainable if demand continues to outstrip supply.
According to currency dealers, many exchange companies are running low on US dollars, raising concerns about potential hoarding or smuggling. “While smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely,” said one currency dealer. This shortage is also a sign of illegal currency operators possibly entering the market, further exacerbating the situation.
Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, warned that “no force can outmuscle the market when the fundamentals are stacked against it”. The rupee has been artificially strengthened by administrative measures, especially in the open market, which has led to a significant slowdown in actual cash transactions. “Exchange companies are hardly ever holding forex cash,” Mamsa noted.

Experts warn administrative measures could backfire

This situation is expected to have a negative impact on remittances in the near future. Mamsa also suggested that it might reignite the use of hawala transactions or cryptocurrency exchanges, which are increasingly used as alternatives for foreign currency dealings.
 
 

Speaking before the National Assembly’s standing committee, Dr Inayat Husain, Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), confirmed that the rupee’s strength since mid-2024 is largely due to higher inflows and administrative controls.
To prevent an “over-correction,” the SBP has purchased $7.8bn from the market, raising reserves to $14.5bn (approximately 2.3 months of import cover). However, officials argue that the rupee is now “fairly valued,” and that interventions are necessary to ensure external stability and counter concerns of an artificial peg.
Meanwhile, exporters are holding back their proceeds, further tightening supply in the market. This has created an uneasy calm — an appearance of strength amid a drying up of supply. Experts warn that if inflows continue to stagnate, the pressure on the rupee could intensify, leading to a sharp correction. “As history shows, markets are always right,” Mamsa added.
On a positive note, Pakistan stands to benefit from a 50pc US tariff on Indian textile exports, which has created a gap in the market worth around $16bn. Additionally, Pakistan enjoys a 19pc tariff on its exports to the US, which is slightly more favourable than Bangladesh and Vietnam, both of which face a 20pc tariff.

The amendments, made to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, were passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate this month amid the opposition’s uproar, as it reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities (LEAs) and the armed forces to detain individuals for up to three months.
“President Asif Ali Zardari has given assent to the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025,” today’s statement by the President’s House said.
“This law strengthens the ability of security agencies to prevent terrorism and protect national security.”
It added that the law included judicial oversight and safeguards to provide recourse against misuse and abuse of power, unlike past arbitrary practices.
“The amendment aims to improve counter-terrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards,” it said. “This is an important step in addressing Pakistan’s ongoing security challenges.”
The bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, read: “The government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case maybe, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.”
This amendment was made to sub-section (1) of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
Any person suspected of activities against national security or safety will be detained, according to the bill, adding that persons involved in target killing, kidnapping for ransom, or extortion can be detained for three months.
The bill also added that it applies “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for [the] purpose of inquiry”.
It stated that the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team, according to the bill.
“The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law-enforcing agencies,” the bill added.
The statement of objects and reasons, presented in the houses during the passage of the bill, said that the current security situation in the country required a “robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework.”
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed, it said.
This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It would facilitate the use of joint interrogation teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence, the statement added.</p><small>2025-08-31 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621180-body-set-up-to-develop-strategies-to-boost-resilience-against-extreme-weather-events' target='_blank'><strong>Body set up to develop strategies to boost resilience against extreme weather events</strong></a><br><p>

Dutchwoman Hassan showed her class to cross the line at the city’s Opera House in two hours, 18 minutes and 22 seconds, well clear of former world record holder Brigid Kosgei of Kenya with last year’s champion Workenesh Edesa third.

In the men’s race, Kiros broke clear of the leading pack with Addisu Gobena at about the 30 kilometre mark and outsprinted his compatriot to win in 2:06:06. Gobena was second while Tebello Ramakongoana of Lesotho was a third.
Kenyan marathon great Eliud Kipchoge, who turned 40 last year, dropped off the leading pack when the two Ethiopians broke away and finished ninth in 2:08:31.
Sydney put on its best face with bright sunshine and cool temperatures as the race joined New York, London, Boston, Chicago, Tokyo and Berlin on the elite majors circuit.
Ramakongoana led the top men across the city’s iconic Harbour Bridge at the head of the field of some 35,000 runners but was soon subsumed into a 25-strong leading pack
Gobena, a 20-year-old running his fourth marathon, made his move as the leaders ran through Centennial Park but Kiros stayed with him and was a comfortable winner in the fastest marathon time ever run on Australian soil.

“The competition was very tough, this was a strong, strong field,” said Kiros, who was fifth at the Berlin Marathon earlier this year.
“But we worked together as partners and now we’re here.”
Hassan said she paid the price for her fast start over the last part of the race but she held on to win her fourth marathon in six starts, including her triumph at last year’s Paris Olympics.
“In the last 10 kilometres I was thinking ‘Oh God, please I don’t want any drama, I just want a normal finish’,” the Ethiopian-born 32-year-old said.
“I pushed too hard at the start and learned my lesson … now I know that it doesn’t work. I’m very happy and very honoured. It’s history, it’s the first major marathon and I’m the first winner.”
It was only the second edition of the 25-year-old marathon run on the current layout.
Hassan’s mark improved Ethiopian Edesa’s winning time from last year of 2:21:41, while Kiros bettered Kenyan Brimin Kipkorir’s 2024 mark of 2:06:18.
Kipchoge, who has won two Olympic and 11 major marathons over his glorious career, said before the race that still competing at 40 was an achievement in itself.
“It was not my day today,” he said. “Above all, I have crossed the finish line to empower the people of Australia. To make Australia a running nation.”</p><small>2025-08-31 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68b238d8798a7.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938296/on-the-trail-of-the-mad-elephant' target='_blank'><strong>ON THE TRAIL OF THE MAD ELEPHANT</strong></a><br><p>I contend that wronged women do not die. They live on as witches, goddesses, spirits, echoes and stories. In the Quran, murdered girls speak in the hereafter too. The book of books says that on the day of judgement a female infant will ask, ‘For which crime did you bury me alive?’
I was working on an index of thematically similar entries across codices when the order was given: keep an account of the imperial hunt. I am no storyteller. Still, a royal command cannot be denied. If the same skills that brought me to sanctuary in the Great Moghul’s Kitabkhana, the largest house of books in the world, now bind me to the page to record the adventures of the hunt, so be it.
To question the Great Moghul is to question why the sun rises in the east, why a lion hunts, why a daughter of Iblis cannot be trusted. I have packed into a leather satchel all the things I need: balms, oils, potions and other concoctions. Nibs like needles, paper thin as a fly’s wings, powder that can be mixed with spit to make ink — implements to fashion miniature texts like this one.
I will set down what I can of the words and deeds of Amar Singh the warrior, Jingu the tracker and Qamaruz Zaman the artist as we travel through the greatest empire in the world, on the trail of the wondrous beasts it contains. Courier pigeons will carry these missives back to the one who sends us, the one I address, the one I hope to please. If he notices this lowly one at all in these pages, may he notice it as one notices the stirring of grain in a sack when a mouse passes.

In 16th century India, a team of four — a warrior, a tracker, an artist and a mysterious
narrator — have been sent by the Great Moghul to record the imperial hunt in his vast
dominions. Their first assignment is to trace a beloved royal court elephant that has
gone rogue. Eos presents, with permission, an excerpt from Ferdowsnama, the latest
novel from Shandana Minhas, recently published by Penguin India…

Maya was the Great Moghul’s most beloved elephant. In times of war, she was tethered close to him, covered in matching metal armour, ready to execute the enemies he sentenced to death. She crushed their heads and removed their limbs with poise and refinement. In times of leisure, she moved with him, dressed in matching finery, from Delhi to Zikri to Nagra to Lahore, and all the minor stars in his dazzling necklace of cities too. She marched behind him in the imperial convoy as it wound through the plains and mountains, valleys and deserts, of the land of many rivers.
The breastplates of the war elephants Maya marched between reflected the gems in her silk and velvet caparisons, her chains of thick gold. Maya’s ears were pierced with sapphire studs, and her iron anklets flashed emeralds. Yak tails brushed smooth hung from the gold filigree net draping her forehead. The net was wrought by the same goldsmiths who served the harem.
Maya’s diet was in line with her status. She ate roots and grasses gathered while dew formed on them and drank from freshly scoured barrels. The fruit offered to her was grown in rosewater. Any bull in the stable who did not please her was sent to a battlefront and not allowed to return; any that pleased her was allowed to please her.
At the time of their union, Maya and her chosen mate were honoured by the presence of the Great Moghul on a lattice-covered platform in the wall of the breeding pen. The Great Moghul was accompanied by a chosen begum clad in a gold filigree face covering and anklets matching Maya’s, with the night’s constellations hennaed on to her skin. Of such pleasure was Maya’s first calf born in Lahore.

A Nath Jogi on the other side of the fire interrupted them. Pulling at his dhoti, he asked if the merchant had heard the Punjabi epic Heer Ranjha. The merchant was sad to say he only knew of the love story so far. He hoped to hear it on this tour and take it back with him too. Did Qamaruz Zaman have knowledge of a translation of it from Punjabi into Persian? Qamaruz Zaman said he was sure the Kitabkhana’s translators were working on it. Surely the merchant knew the Great Moghul had all the stories circulating through his empire recited to him? Then he had the ones worth sharing translated into its many tongues so his subjects could know them too.

Shortly after the birth of her calf, Maya began to move away when the calf tried to nurse. She began rolling up her trunk at delicacies, pacing circles into the elephant ground by the Ravi. She grew restless on walks through Lahore’s gardens. The animal hakim and astrologer spent days poring over Maya’s chart and faeces. They advised a change of scenery as Scorpio moved into Mars.
But the weather was turning. The Great Moghul did not want to leave the warmth and security of his fort and harem or abandon the daily banquets in which alliances were made or renewed or the Thursday symposiums in which Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Jesuits and those wholly without a sense of the Creator debated metaphysics and exchanged opinions on more mundane matters, such as how and when to pray, or when it was acceptable to conceal one’s faith from other people. He ordered that Maya’s chains be unfastened, her enclosure opened, so she and the calf could wander at will.
Mother and calf ambled through the courtyard where elephant fights took place, down the sloping ramps between Lahore Fort’s massive stone walls and out of its gates, past the brick-and-wood houses of the rich, through the thatched mud-brick shanties of the poor clustered around them like ticks, and into the countryside. They meandered through fields, villages, waterways and wilderness with only two mahouts for company.
Messages were dispatched back to Lahore at regular intervals to bring the Great Moghul news of the elephant he cherished more than all the others. The winter winds blew harder, but the only concerning news of Maya was that she would not accept a caparison or let one be thrown over her calf. Then, some weeks after they left Lahore, a message came. The calf had been taken by a muggermuch on a bank of the Sutlej, and a madness had come upon Maya.
The calf was frolicking in the sun-dappled shallows of the river alongside some water buffaloes when the crocodile rose and snapped its spike-toothed jaws shut on its trunk. The buffaloes scarpered up the bank as the crocodile dragged its prey under the silty water. Maya charged in till only her eyes were visible above the opalescent green, casting her trunk about till she felt a long, scaled body. She wrapped her trunk around it and backed on to the riverbank, pulling the reptile’s scaled, elongated torso and limbs with her.
The crocodile’s head remained under water as it tried to thrash free. The mud on the banks was gouged by their titanic struggle. Maya flapped her ears and, swiftly shifting her grip to the crocodile’s tail, moved alongside its body, so that it was bent like a bow, and then she knelt. Her own tail aloft and vibrating, she lowered her great head as if in worship and pressed her knees into its back. The reptile’s spine snapped.
When it stopped moving, Maya wrapped her trunk around its belly and pulled the rest of it out of the water. The thin trunk of her calf emerged last, still trapped in the reptile’s jaws. Nothing remained below the calf’s front legs. While she had battled one crocodile, others had ripped it apart.
Maya waded into the river and cast her trunk through its cold, murky depths but found nothing. She came out of the water flapping her ears and trumpeting. The mahouts who had tended her since infancy approached, making soothing sounds. She tossed them aside. They rose into the air like messenger birds carrying ominous news and fell nearby. Both took the measure of Maya’s mood and tried to stagger upright and run in opposite directions, but the mud grasped at their bare feet. Maya was upon them in no time. She laid one flat on the ground and trod on his head so it popped. She took the other by an arm and smashed him against the trunk of a cypress, which remained elegantly impassive.
She then turned her attention to a makeshift washing platform further down the bank and the women watching from the rocks there. Terror broke their paralysis, and they fled up the incline from which a clear, swift stream fed the river. Maya tackled the rocks like a goat till she was among them. We have this account from the sole survivor of that carnage. Maya’s depredations along the waterways of the Punjab since have left no others. Our newly formed company leaves the Kitabkhana tomorrow to investigate her rampage. It will be my first time outside it since I was brought here.
Jingu left Delhi on foot in the darkness. Amar Singh, Qamaruz Zaman and I left at first light. We travelled rapidly, changing horses at imperial posts where Qamaruz Zaman collected the messages waiting for us, chatted with strangers and plotted the next leg of our journey. Amar Singh spent his time washing, cleaning his weapons or bathing in the hammam if there was one.
At our first stop, I followed him into the hammam. I took off the soft cotton cloak that covered me from neck to ankle, and the leather sandals and layers of socks covering my gnarled feet. I began unwrapping the strips of pus-pocked muslin around me, beginning at the neck. I saw Amar Singh blanch. I did not take this to heart. I look at trees denuded in winter, each dry seam and crack exposed, and know I am not alone.
 


I hear Qamaruz Zaman calling you, Amar Singh said.
I rewrapped the muslin, pulled my socks and sandals back on and went outside. Qamaruz Zaman was nowhere in sight. I did not enter the hammam again. When Amar Singh emerged, I heard him tell Qamaruz Zaman to tell me to conduct my ablutions away from the rest of us. Why me? Qamaruz Zaman asked. Because you seem to enjoy acting like you are the leader, so you can enjoy doing the difficult parts of leading too, Amar Singh replied. But Qamaruz Zaman did not need to tell me.
At the next stop, and at each one after that, I remained with our supplies, ignoring the looks and the offerings, till one of the others came back, then went off on my own. It took us four days and three nights to catch up with Maya.
On the last leg of the journey we took to the mighty Sindhu. A fisherman took us down the wide, seemingly placid river along which the busiest trade route in the empire runs. We stepped from his small craft on to a thin pier leading up to a gate into the caravanserai at Kot Layya. The evening sky’s blush was deepening into the purple that floods the skin of poisoned men. The caravanserai was small but well-constructed.
A wall three man-spans high surrounded a paved courtyard lined with stalls for animals and, in opposite corners, a kitchen and private quarters for those who could afford them. Bigger gates, with a watchtower over them, were flung open on the other side of the courtyard. An open-air dormitory ran along the ramparts on either side of the watchtower. The caravanserai was already packed and more people kept entering.
The din of birds settling for the night rose from the thick forest of sheesham, acacia, mulberry, neem and babool visible through the gates on the other side. The din competed with the sound of the hollow rhino horn a guard on the ramparts was blowing to remind people who were still in the forest: Hurry! Hurry!
As the gates began to close, we joined others circling the courtyard looking for a place to bed down. The stalls were full. Fleeing families were packed in with livestock and goods. Goats, sheep, mules and horses jostled for space with pot-bellied children and potters, weavers, traders, farmers and herding dogs. Men packed the baked brick staircase up to the ramparts hoping to find a rope bed and count the stars.
I followed Qamaruz Zaman and Amar Singh as they considered the food and drink on offer, soaking in the sights, sounds and smells. There was barbecued meat, grilled vegetables, puffed grain offerings, baked and fried fish and bread, chicken roasts and stews, sanbusas stuffed with lentils, potatoes or mince, jaggery-sweetened grain, and a variety of beverages to beat the evening chill.
Qamaruz Zaman bought us clay bowls of fish stew and bread with coins from the purse he’d been the first to hold out a hand for, back at the Kitabkhana. Qamaruz Zaman stroked his salt-and-pepper handlebar moustache upwards, wiped crumbs from his pocked chin, flicked the thick brocade of his yellow embroidered silk coat upwards and seated himself on a plump cushion close to a fire presided over by a Persian merchant.
At his signal Amar Singh and I sank cross-legged on to the bare earth close by. I slipped a teardrop of elixir into my bowl. The merchant was taking his family on a tour of the Great Moghul’s empire, about which they had all heard so much in Isfahan. He was curious about the indigo and marigold stains on Qamaruz Zaman’s fingers.
Behind us, slumped beside the open gate of a stall guarding their bales, two traders from Xinjiang were discussing the fall of the Ming Empire in a little-known Chagatai dialect. One had heard the deposed ruler had successfully killed his consort and two daughters before hanging himself from a tree. The other had heard the youngest daughter survived having her arm lopped off, and that the new ruler was personally supervising her recuperation from the blood loss. He wanted to preserve the bloodline and legitimise his own throne. They expressed themselves freely, thinking nobody around them would be able to understand their dialect. If the daughter had indeed survived… to think of a daughter of the Ming line so dishonoured! It would have been better if her blood had nourished a seed of vengeance.
 

Shah Jahan Hunting Blackbuck with Trained Cheetahs

Amar Singh noticed me cocking my head towards the traders and whispered to ask if I could understand what they were saying. It was only the second time since we were bound together in the Kitabkhana that he had directly addressed me. I told him the traders were attempting to answer that ageless philosophical question: of what use is a maimed woman?
After the joke, I provided a concise and accurate summary of their exchange. Amar Singh was happy with my efforts. He chuckled at my joke and put out a hand to pat me on the back. He could not disguise the discomfort that flashed across his swarthy, striking face when his long, calloused fingers felt the ridges of my shoulder. He kept his black eyes trained on my brown ones. His long, thick lashes were petals to black irises. Where my lashes should have been, scar tissue radiated out like spokes from a wheel. The heat of Amar Singh’s hand warmed my shoulder. It was a good payoff for a bad joke and an adequate translation.
There were other benefits too. Amar Singh had witnessed my facility with languages. He had seen that under the scar tissue I was a man just like him, with a man’s understanding of the world, a man’s appetites and a man’s humour.
Qamaruz Zaman remained engrossed in conversation with the Persian merchant, stopping only to admire the merchant’s young daughter, who had emerged from the nobles’ quarters, with an attendant — a large, foul-smelling dog with matted brown fur —  trailing her. The dog’s antecedents were impossible to trace. Even its eyes were different colours.
The girl was my height but still wore her inky hair in two plaits, a tactic that enabled her to avoid the veiling Persian aristocracy favoured, despite the fine black down coating her pale upper lip. She asked her father if she could go count the stars from the ramparts too. The merchant smiled. How could he deny his little princess anything while she was still his? The girl chained the dog to a ring, which was bolted into a wall close to the nobles’ quarters, and leapt up the staircase. The elderly attendant pursued, trying to throw an embroidered chador over her like a net.
The merchant gestured for Qamaruz Zaman to continue describing his work as a folio illustrator for an eccentric, reclusive noble. What an interesting life he must lead. The merchant did him too much honour, Qamaruz Zaman said in his courtly, refined manner. It was a quiet, uneventful life. His noble employer’s library was a small, insignificant one. The most exciting thing that had ever happened to him was a dream he’d had about being inside the imperial library. There, he had heard, scores of illustrators worked tirelessly and ceaselessly in departments dedicated to the highest spheres of knowledge and practice — poetry, astrology, calligraphy, translation, illustration, history, metaphysics, demonology, mythology and religion.
What a wonderful dream it had been! So many folios! So many parchments! So many albums! So many books! But when he woke up, he was just a small man again, in service to a small house, sent here and there to make sketches of root vegetables or berry bushes. He was only at the caravanserai to sketch a rare mushroom in the dense forest beyond the serai gates, a task he intended to begin at sunrise. How fortunate he was, after days on the road with companions as illiterate and dim-witted as his guard and attendant, to be even briefly again in cultured company. Qamaruz Zaman subtly led the Persian merchant to a discussion of his own interests, which we learnt had to do with the shortcomings and virtues of different versions of the Shahnameh.
A Nath Jogi on the other side of the fire interrupted them. Pulling at his dhoti, he asked if the merchant had heard the Punjabi epic Heer Ranjha. The merchant was sad to say he only knew of the love story so far. He hoped to hear it on this tour and take it back with him too. Did Qamaruz Zaman have knowledge of a translation of it from Punjabi into Persian? Qamaruz Zaman said he was sure the Kitabkhana’s translators were working on it. Surely the merchant knew the Great Moghul had all the stories circulating through his empire recited to him? Then he had the ones worth sharing translated into its many tongues so his subjects could know them too.
The merchant asked if it was true that the Great Moghul could not read. Qamaruz Zaman said it was. It was another sign of divine favour to him. The Prophet Muhammad couldn’t read either. The Persian said he was merely wondering how the Great Moghul decided which stories were worth telling. Qamaruz Zaman opened his mouth to answer when the Nath interjected again.
He didn’t want to dilute praise of the Great Moghul’s generosity or grace — may they fertilise the world forever — he simply wanted to know if, in the impending translation, Ranjha’s initiation into Nath ways would be treated as a calculation or a revelation. He had concerns that a less discerning audience might see the sorcerer’s path as simply a clever ruse for getting closer to forbidden objects of desire.
Qamaruz Zaman and the merchant agreed that the last thing anybody needed was a wave of ash-coated, scantily dressed, useless romantics mooning about the fields getting in women’s way. There was uproarious laughter, which stopped abruptly at the sudden beating of drums from the watchtower by the gate.
‘She’s here!’ the guard at the top yelled into the night beyond the closed gates. ‘The mad elephant’s here!’

This discourse ebbs and flows with time, and it has returned for yet another round.
In his August 23, 2025 column in Dawn, the founder-president of the think-tank Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) Ahmad Bilal Mehboob points out that those in favour of more provinces claim that “practically all our governance problems will be resolved once we create more provinces.” He rightly questions the practicality of such a sweeping conclusion. 
The political analyst Najam Sethi — though in favour of more provinces — is realistic enough to remain sceptical about such a possibility. According to him, the sub-nationalist sentiments in most ethnic groups of the country are just too strong to allow the groups and their leaders to come to any settlement in this regard with the federal government. 
Even the mainstream parties that often occupy the treasury and opposition benches in the National Assembly largely avoid speaking on this subject because they fear that they would lose electoral traction — especially in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and in the ‘Saraiki-speaking belt’ of Punjab. 
But one can posit that the matter of suggesting additional provinces has always been more of a ploy to put pressure on the provinces to make some concessions to the state. For example, the military establishment (ME), which has always preferred a deeply centralised set-up, believes that the provinces should renegotiate the funds they receive from the centre — especially now, because ‘Pakistan’s increasing importance’ and concerns in the changing global order requires a financially sound federal government and armed forces. 

Calls for new provinces in Pakistan often resurface with promises of solving governance crises. But Karachi’s long, tumultuous history shows how ethnic anxieties and power struggles make such ‘solutions’ far more complicated

Nevertheless, whereas most Pakistanis are not willing to support the creation of more provinces (due to their respective ethnic interests), there are activists and politicians within certain parties that do. The biggest among these is the Mohajir/Urdu-speaking-dominated nationalist party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). Formed in 1984, by the late 1980s, it became Karachi’s largest party. One of its major demands is to turn Sindh’s capital, Karachi, into a separate province. 
MQM, and mostly non-Sindhi middle-class Karachiites, support this demand. But if this demand is to be met due to the fact that Karachi has a Mohajir majority, then another fact brings this equation into question: the Mohajir community’s population in the city is steadily declining.
From being almost 60 percent in 1951, it fell to 48 percent in 1998, and 42 percent in 2017, before bouncing back to approximately 50 percent in 2023. But the population of the city’s Pakhtun community has been growing faster. The Pakhtun are now Karachi’s second largest ethnic group, followed by the Sindhis, Punjabi, Baloch and Saraiki. 
Until its conquest by the British in the first half of the 19th century, Karachi was a small coastal town with just over 50,000 inhabitants. Most of them were Sindhi and Baloch, and the town was in the hands of Sindhi rulers who used to govern it from Sindh’s then capital, Hyderabad. 
In 1840, the British made Karachi Sindh’s new capital. However, three years later, the British incorporated Sindh and its new capital into the ‘Bombay Presidency’ — a major administrative subdivision of British India, centred in the city of Bombay (present-day Mumbai). 
Sindhi politicians and intellectuals began a long struggle against this decision, but the city’s population continued to grow rapidly when the British started turning it into a modern port city. In 1936, however, most Karachi-based politicians and businessmen succeeded in getting Karachi reinstated as Sindh’s capital when the Bombay Presidency folded and Sindh became a province again. Karachi became a ‘surplus city’ due to its powerful economy. 
According to the 1941 census, over 60 percent of Karachi’s population was Sindhi. Just six percent were Urdu-speakers. But, after Pakistan’s creation in 1947, millions of Urdu-speakers poured in from India. The city’s demographics witnessed a dramatic shift. By 1951, over 60 percent of Karachi’s population was Urdu-speaking Mohajirs and the Sindhi population was reduced to just six percent. 
What’s more, in 1948, the federal government suggested the separation of Karachi from Sindh and declared it Pakistan’s federal capital territory. Sindhi politicians and intelligentsia rejected the suggestion. They were also angry over the ‘arrogant manner’ in which this was being done. According to the late historian Dr Hamida Khuhro, when prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan was confronted on the issue by the then-chief minister of Sindh, M. Ayub Khuhro, he told the minister, “…the Sindh government has to move out [of Karachi]… go make your capital in Hyderabad.”
 


Despite multiple protests by the Sindhis, the Sindh government finally relented — but only after the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, promised that the federal government would compensate Sindh for the financial losses that it would incur due the separation of its wealthy capital. This promise was never fulfilled. 
In 1955, Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra and acting head of state Iskander Mirza abolished all provinces in West Pakistan and turned it into a ‘one unit.’ This move was supported by Punjab and the Mohajirs, but was vigorously opposed by other ethnic groups. It was seen as a ploy by the state to marginalise and eliminate the political and cultural interests of Sindhi, Baloch, Pakhtun and Bengali communities. 
Then, in 1959, Karachi stopped being the federal capital as well. Islamabad became the new capital and, while it was being built, Rawalpindi in Punjab worked as an interim capital till 1967. 
Opposition against the ‘one unit’ intensified during the last years of the Gen Ayub Khan dictatorship. And even though Karachi enjoyed a decade of rapid industrialisation, much of its Mohajir majority had by then started to lose its political and economic influence. Mohajir economic elites, however, continued to benefit due to Gen Ayub’s economic policies. 
The first major ethnic riots in the city took place in early 1965 (between the Pakhtuns and Mohajirs). After Ayub’s fall in March 1969, the new dictator, Gen Yahya Khan, abolished the one unit and restored the provinces.
Then, on July 1, 1970, just before the country’s first major parliamentary elections, Karachi was once again declared the capital of Sindh. On that day, Radio Pakistan’s Karachi studios played Sindhi music, something that it often wasn’t allowed to do before. The music programme began with a couplet by the famous Sindhi poet Shah Abdul Latif. 
Thrice Karachi was made Sindh’s capital and twice this status was taken away from it. The city is now thoroughly cosmopolitan and ethnically diverse. Yet, its historic roots are still deeply entrenched in the history of Sindh. It would be foolish to once again uproot its status on one pretext or the other. History is pitched against those dreaming of doing this for the fourth time.

Announcing the decision, Ombudsperson Fauzia Viquar also imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on the head of a private teaching institution for misusing CCTV surveillance and harassing a female officer.
The decision arose in the case of a subordinate employee at the institution in Rawalpindi against its chief executive officer where the complainant alleged that she was subjected to excessive surveillance and intimidation.
After reviewing the evidence, the ombudsperson found that the accused had engaged in unjustified and targeted monitoring, including sending CCTV screenshots to the complainant, which created a hostile and distressing work environment.
 
 

The ombudsperson declared this behaviour to be harassment under the law and ordered payment of Rs50,000 in compensation to the victim and a penalty of censure against the CEO.
The ombudsperson also directed mandatory workplace reforms, including formation of an inquiry committee and the public display of the workplace code of conduct in both English and Urdu.
The ruling underscores that harassment is not confined to unwelcome advances but includes any conduct that violates dignity, privacy or creates fear and intimidation at work.
“This case is a reminder that surveillance cannot be misused to control, target or intimidate employees.
Privacy and dignity are fundamental workplace rights,” the ombudsperson’s office stated.

In a notice, seen by Dawn, issued to the project’s management unit of KPCIP, the NAB’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) chapter directed officials to furnish all records related to consultant hiring, contractor pre-qualification, bid submissions, audit reports and advertisements.
The bureau cautioned that concealing or misreporting facts could lead to penal consequences under the National Acco­untability Ordin­ance, 1999.
The move follows allegations by lawmakers in the KP Assembly of massive irregularities amounting to Rs32 billion in the project, which is funded by the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Demands all records, cautions officials against hiding or misreporting facts

The KPCIP is designed to upgrade urban infrastructure and services in the cities of Peshawar, Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan and Mingora.
According to complaints raised before the Public Accounts Committee, a joint venture of Zahir Khan and Brothers and the Turkish firm T.T.Ş-Insaat LLC was unlawfully awarded contracts.
Lawmakers alleged the joint venture, at the time of bidding, was not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue, the KP Revenue Authority, or the Pakistan Engineering Council.
 
 

Further allegations include that the venture received undue financial favours and billions in disbursements despite negligible on-ground progress.
The complaints also cite false progress certifications, weak oversight, and tax evasion by the
foreign partner, which allegedly failed to pay income, sales, or withholding taxes, causing substantial losses to the state.
However, Kashif Jan, a project director for Zahir Khan and Brothers, rejected the accusations while talking to Dawn.
“We have been working transparently and have ensured quality of work in all projects,” Mr Jan said. “Zahir Khan and Brothers is a well reputed firm and we never compromise on quality.”
The inquiry comes as the KP provincial government, led by the PTI, has faced persistent allegations of corruption, with sitting ministers having levelled accusations against each other and against Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.

It was a grand function arranged by the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) to celebrate his arrival.
There were moments there where the 50-year-old Peruvian would’ve felt like royalty; garlanded by all the attendees turn by turn, some tugging at him for a picture on a sweltering summer night. There was also a mini-ceremony where the former Newcastle United legend was sat on the stage and a sehrabandi — where a decorative headdress is tied — took place.
It made for awkward viewing, but Solano was unmoved. The newly appointed Pakistan senior and under-23 football coach is patient — and going by the events that took place, very tolerant. And Solano is also willing to play the long game — both literally and figuratively — to take Pakistan football to the top.
“We need to start somewhere,” Solano told Eos in an interview last week, hours before his official unveiling. “It can start with the qualifiers for the AFC [Asian Football Confederation] Under-23 Championship.”

Former Peruvian footballer Nolbert Solano has just taken over as Pakistan’s head coach. He says he will adapt his coaching style to the realities in the country. But perhaps, most importantly, he will need to demonstrate patience…

The September 3-9 qualifiers for next year’s continental tournament are Solano’s first assignment, with Pakistan due to face Iraq, Cambodia and Oman in Group ‘G’. “If we can somehow make it to the [tournament] finals, it could be the start of something new.”
 
 

Solano, however, understands lifting Pakistan football isn’t a sprint but a marathon, and he radiates an aura of certainty, a sense of security that he wouldn’t be judged immediately and that he has the backing of recently elected PFF president, Mohsen Gilani. 
“Mohsen is a football person… he’s well-travelled and has worked in football development across the world,” says Solano. “He understands what needs to be built and how that needs to be done. When I spoke with him I could see his passion. He wants his country to do well and was very keen for me to come here because there is a lot of young talent here but we need to elevate them.”
How Solano manages to do that will be seen at the Under-23 qualifiers but, apart from that, he will be picking up from where his predecessor, Stephen Constantine, left off. 
Constantine delivered perhaps Pakistan football’s greatest moment when, in October 2023, he guided the national team to their first-ever triumph in a World Cup qualifier. That historic victory over Cambodia saw Pakistan make it to the second round of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which has brought regular competitive matches for the team. 
Even though wins have been at a premium, this campaign is merely a learning curve for a side that had been plagued by a plethora of issues off the field, due to the decade-long institutional crisis in the PFF. Having lost all their matches in the second round of qualifying for the World Cup, Pakistan parachuted into the third qualifying round for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, where they opened Group ‘E’ with back-to-back losses against Syria and Myanmar.
A home-and-away double-header against Afghanistan in October and qualifying for Asia’s premier tournament might be a long shot — only the group winners earn a spot at the finals in Saudi Arabia — Solano isn’t one for throwing in the towel.
“Sometimes you need to start in difficult conditions,” he says, not referring to the Asian Cup qualifiers but about the state of Pakistan football in general. “It will be tough, yes. But I believe we can do something. I believe in myself. It will not happen in a short period. It will take some time.”
The Pakistan job, he believes, came to him at the right time. As a coach, Solano hasn’t lasted a year in any of his past jobs since he left as assistant coach of the Peru national team.

During his stint with his home side, Solano achieved what he was unable to as a player: take Peru to the World Cup. In 2018, he was part of Ricardo Gareca’s coaching staff that saw Peru qualify for their first World Cup in 36 years.
Upon appointing Solano, Mohsen had highlighted that fact and also that never had Pakistan seen an ex-player of such calibre take over as coach. Solano, though, isn’t dwelling on his reputation as a player. He’s looking to make his mark as a coach.
“As a coach, I left my career as a football professional,” he reflected. “There are millions of coaches, asking for opportunities and, when you have them, you have to take them,” he adds, referring to him taking over as Pakistan coach. “When the initial contact was made, I looked up the history of Pakistan football and I know there have been some difficult times [in the recent past] but I’m a very positive person.”
That positivity is perhaps what the PFF felt it needed to re-energise the national team. The PFF has only recently emerged from a six-year period of “normalisation” and the crisis in the country’s football body prior to that had left the domestic structure in ruins.
 
 

Constantine had been vocal about the FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee’s inability to kickstart domestic competitions, which he believed would give the local players a chance to play regularly. 
Solano, though, for now is leaving the “PFF to sort out the issues.” In the meantime, he is willing to adapt not only how he manages his playing resources but also his philosophy as a coach.
“I’ve been living in England for the last 20 years, and I have a lot of friends from Pakistan and I know for a fact that there are a lot of diaspora players who want to represent the country,” he details. “We already have a number of diaspora players in the national team and we can look for more till the players here start to improve. 
“We can’t forget about the ones here. But the good thing is that, with the local players, we can work more since they are all here. We have to give them the opportunity to get better.”
Solano is only the second South American coach to have been given the reins of the Pakistan national team, after Brazilian Jose Antonio Nogueira, who had a year-long stint in 2018. South American flair has always seemed to resonate with Pakistan’s football psyche and Solano is keen on bringing that to the national team.
 
 

“I want my players to express themselves,” Solano says, noting he will be tactically fluid with his team’s set-up according to the players’ strengths. “My idea is to have good discipline and enjoy having the ball. When you have the ball, you have more opportunity to score.
“I’m an adaptive coach. Once we have the team together, we will see the strengths of the players and the formations would be to maximise those. But the idea will be to play good football and get results.”
Only time will tell whether Solano is the man who makes Pakistan’s national team less pragmatic. It will require practice and, most importantly, patience. Solano, in his first few days as Pakistan coach, has already shown he has plenty of that.

Opener Saim smashed a 38-ball 69, with four sixes and seven fours, while Hasan’s 26-ball 56 included six maximums, lifting Pakistan to 207 all out in exactly 20 overs.
Asif Khan threatened to snatch an unlikely win for UAE with a brilliant 35-ball 77 before falling in the last over.
The UAE managed 176-8 from their 20 overs.
 






Skipper Muhammad Waseem also hit a breezy 18-ball 33 but was run out in the sixth over.
Earlier, Pakistan’s innings was built around the excellence of Saim and Hasan after they won the toss and batted first.
Once Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman and skipper Salman Agha cheaply, it was left to Saim and Hasan to provide the rescue acts.
Saim’s fourth T20I half-century came off just 25 balls while Hasan’s fifty was reached in 24 deliveries with a hat-trick of sixes off spinner Haider Ali.
Hasan added 57 for the fifth wicket off just 25 balls with Mohammad Nawaz, who added a 15-ball 25.
Faheem Ashraf chipped in with 16 as Pakistan clubbed 64 in the last five overs.
Junaid Siddique and Saghir Khan grabbed three wickets apiece, but were both expensive.
Pakistan skipper Salman saidhe wanted death bowling to improve.
“It was a perfect batting game. First 15 overs with the bowling we were good, but the last five overs we need to work on. It’s something we have been working on but yeah we need to get better,” he said.
“I think our death bowling is something we are working on and it’s concerning. We need to be better in the next game, but overall we have been playing really well and this is how we want to continue playing.”
Afghanistan, who lost to Pakistan by 39 runs on Friday, face the UAE in the next match on Monday.

Hundreds of thousands of mostly smallholders have been displaced, with floodwaters sweeping away their food and other crops.
More agricultural land will be swallowed by the raging waters, surging southwards to converge with the Indus in the coming days. A major economic upheaval is already emerging, along with a humanitarian crisis. Though it is still too early for a full assessment of the damage wreaked on crops and livestock, initial reports suggest that farmers’ losses are already running into billions.
 
 

The deluge has wiped out standing rice, maize and other crops besides vegetables in more than 2,100 villages located along the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab. The rushing waters are now expected to inflict further damage on croplands in Punjab’s cotton-producing southern districts before cascading into Sindh.
The agricultural losses will weigh heavily on both the economy and people. The destruction of crops and disruption of food supply chains have set the stage for spiralling food inflation. The 2022 floods offer a sobering reminder: food prices surged month after month. But the impact of flooding goes beyond food inflation.
For many of the affected farmers — mostly smallholders — the devastation is total: with crops, livestock, homes and livelihoods all swept away. Left with nothing to live on — let alone invest in the next crop — more people are likely to slip below the poverty line. The increase in the prices of essential foods will disproportionately affect low-income rural and urban households. Beyond the immediate impact, the economic costs are staggering. The agriculture losses will be felt across industries, and reduce automobile and fertiliser sales.
More worrying is the impact on the fragile balance-of-payments situation, with the deluge likely to push up the import bill due to domestic shortages of food items. Exports, on the other hand, may suffer due to production losses in rice and cotton.
 
 

Overall, the damage to farm output will keep GDP growth depressed. The farm sector, which forms nearly a quarter of the economy and employs almost 40pc of the labour force, had grown marginally by 0.56pc — the lowest in a decade — last year against a five-year average of 3.38pc. Pakistan has suffered nearly 20 major flood disasters since 1950 — half of them in the last two decades.
Climate change is intensifying their frequency and severity, yet national preparedness remains inadequate. The lesson from the current disaster is clear: floods are no longer freak incidents but recurring economic shocks that depress GDP growth, widen deficits, wash away livelihoods and drag millions deeper into poverty.
Unless we radically overhaul our disaster preparedness and invest in agricultural resilience, each new flood event will drown villages, devastate livelihoods and reduce growth.

The groups, including Amnesty Int­ernational, the Human Rights Com­mi­ssion of Pakistan (HRCP) and Defence of Human Rights (DHR), voiced collective alarm over what they described as a systemic failure to deliver justice, truth or reparations to victims and their families.
 
 

“A flawed system of accountability and official data from the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappear­a­nces (COIOED) reveals the scale of the problem but also the system’s failure to provide meaningful justice,” cha­­irperson of Defence of Human Rig­­hts (DHR) Amna Masood Janjua said.
Ms Janjua noted that state institutions have practised enforced disappearances with utmost impunity for over two decades.

HRCP, seven other groups seek justice, legal reforms on International Day of Victims of Enforced Disappearances

Other groups involved in the conference were the Baloch Yakjehti Com­m­ittee (BYC), Pashtun Tahafuz Move­ment (PTM), Voice for Missing Per­s­o­­ns of Sindh (VMPS), Sindhian Natio­nal Congress, and the Asian Federation Against Involuntary and Enforced Disappearances (AFAD).
Speakers highlighted that since 2010, the commission has documented 10,592 cases, including over 3,000 submitted by the DHR. They added that 140 new cases were reported this year alone.
 
 

The DHR chairperson said the commission has never ordered a prosecution against a single perpetrator, reinforcing a culture of impunity.
“In a handful of cases where this Commission has issued production orders, it failed miserably to get them complied,” Ms Janjua said.
 
 

“Our demands, ironically the same for the last 20 years, are to immediately disclose the whereabouts of all forcibly disappeared individuals and hold perpetrators accountable throu­­gh independent, impartial investigations and fair trials,” she added.
The speakers, including rights act­i­v­­ists Afrasiyab Khan Khattak and Ta­­hira Abdullah, also noted that a re­­cent amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act that allows security forces to detain individuals for up to three months is evi­dence that the tightening of the noose around citizens’ necks was on the rise.
Truth, Reconciliation Commission
Ms Abdullah called it “deplorable” that while the National Judicial Policy Making Committee has announced a committee to address the issue of enforced disappearances, results are still awaited.
She called for either reforming the COIOED or establishing a new, victi­m-centred “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” with representation from the families of the disappeared.
Later, the groups released a joint statement highlighting that authorities intentionally use disappearances as a tool to suppress political activists, ethnic minorities, journalists, and human rights defenders.
The BYC reported 546 cases this year, the PTM recorded 133, and the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh noted 40, with more than 1,300 people still missing.
The statement criticised authorities for their continued reliance on laws that enable arbitrary detentions, such as the Army Act, the Official Secrets Act, and the Actions (in Aid of Civil Power) Regulation of 2011.
These laws, it said, limit judicial oversight and allow for prolonged incommunicado detentions under the pretext of national security.
The organisations said Pakistan is obligated to protect against arbitrary detention and torture. They deman­ded that the county must ratify the International Conven­tion for the Pro­tection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

• US president vows to fight back
WASHINGTON: A US appeals court has ruled that many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have upended global trade, were illegal — but allowed them to remain in place for now, giving him time to take the fight to the Supreme Court.
The 7-4 ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday affirmed a lower court’s finding that Trump had exceeded his authority in tapping emergency economic powers to impose wide-ranging duties.
But the judges allowed the tariffs to stay in place through mid-October — and Trump swiftly made clear he would put the time to use.
The appeals court “incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,” he said in a statement on his Truth Social platform lashing out at the ruling.
He added that he would fight back “with the help of the United States Supreme Court”. The decision marks a blow to the president, who has wielded duties as a wide-ranging economic policy tool.
 
 

It could also cast doubt over deals Trump has struck with major trading partners such as the European Union, and raised the question of what would happen to the billions of dollars collected by the United States since the tariffs were put in place if the conservative-majority Supreme Court does not back him.
Friday’s case, however, does not deal with sector-specific tariffs that the Trump administration has also imposed on steel, aluminum, autos and other imports.
‘Diplomatic embarrassment’
Since returning to the presiden­cy in January, Trump has invoked the International Emergency Econo­mic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose “reciprocal” tariffs on almost all US trading partners, with a 10-percent baseline level and higher rates for dozens of economies.
He invoked similar authorities to slap separate tariffs hitting Mexico, Canada and China over the flow of deadly drugs into the United States.
The Court of International Trade had ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority with across-the-board global levies, blocking most of the duties from taking effect, but the appeals court later put the ruling on hold to consider the case.
Friday’s ruling noted that “the statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”.
It added that it was not addressing if Trump’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or deciding whether IEEPA authorises any tariffs at all.
Instead, it sought to resolve the question of whether Trump’s “reci­procal” tariffs and those imposed over trafficking were authorised, with the document noting: “We conclude they are not.”
In a supplementary filing just hours before the appeals court released its decision, Trump cabinet officials argued that ruling the global tariffs illegal and blocking them would hurt US foreign policy and national security.
“Such a ruling would threaten broader US strategic interests at home and abroad, likely lead to retaliation and the unwinding of agreed-upon deals by foreign-trading partners,” wrote Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.  He added that they could also “derail critical ongoing negotiations” with partners.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, warned that suspending the effectiveness of tariffs “would lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment”.
Several legal challenges have been filed against the tariffs Trump invoked. If these tariffs are ultimately ruled illegal, companies could seek reimbursements.

The department placed a report in the case file of Dr Fowzia Siddiqui, who is seeking her sister Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release from a US prison, noting that the notices to premier and his ministers over non-compliance of the order were not executable.
In its report, the registrar office proposed the formation of a larger bench to deliberate over three central legal issues.
The office questioned whether a judge can self-assign cases to their court, violating the Roster of Sitting. It also asked whether a judge can hear a case without the issuance of the approved cause list and whether the consent of various benches is mandatory for the consolidation of identical petitions.

IHC registrar office proposes larger bench to determine legality

The development follows the Aug 29 reassignment of the case from Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, who had issued the sweeping contempt notices, to Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
The change is part of a new “Roster of Sitting” taking effect on Sept 1.
On July 21, Justice Ejaz Ishaq issued the notices; however, that particular proceeding became questionable, as the judge was not inc­l­u­ded in the Roster of Sitting approved by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, since he was on a five-week leave effective from July 20.
Consequently, the registrar office put an administrative hold on these notices, pending approval from the competent authority.
Following these developments, and according to the cause list issued by the IHC registrar’s office, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas is now scheduled to address the case with a new hearing date slated for September 1.
Meanwhile, under the new roster, Justice Ejaz Ishaq has been placed on a special division bench with Justice Babar Sattar to hear tax and commercial matters, a posting that prevents him from sitting as a single-judge court and hearing such petitions.
Dr. Fowzia Siddiqui’s petition, pending in the court since 2015, seeks to compel Pakistan’s government to formally support Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, who was imprisoned in the US in 2008 on terrorism charges. The government has so far refused to file an amicus brief in US courts on her behalf.

Officials said that international conflicts, natural calamities and other issues resulted in a 90 per cent drop in tourism across the region.
Sajid Hussain, assistant director at the GB Tourism Department, said that only 270 international climbers arrived in GB this year to attempt peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II and Nanga Parbat, as compared to more than 2,000 foreign climbers and trekkers who visited the region last year.
He said that most climbers returned without success due to extreme weather conditions at the peaks. Rockfalls, avalanches and high winds forced many to abandon their attempts and remain at base camps before heading back to their countries.
 
 

According to the department, only 40 climbers summited K2, 25 reached Nanga Parbat and about a dozen summited Gasherbrum-I this season.
Iqbal Hussain, director at the GB Tourism Department, told Dawn that last year 24,000 foreign tourists without permits visited GB, along with one million domestic tourists. This year, he said, the situation is alarming as tourist arrivals — both international and domestic — have declined by 90pc.
Asghar Ali Porik, a tour operator, said several factors contributed to the sharp decline in foreign ad­v­e­­nture tourists. “The legal battle between the GB To­­urism Department and tour operators over the hike in permit fees, the Iran-Israel conflict, tensions between Pakistan and India, and unpredictable we­ather conditions at peaks compelled many forei­gn climbers and trekkers to cancel their plans,” he added.
A tea stall owner on the Karakoram Highway said that the tourism season usually runs from May to October. “I have never experienced such a situation where you can go the whole day without a single client and return home empty-handed,” he said.
Like him, hotel owners, shopkeepers, transporters, porters and tour operators are also facing financial losses.
Haider Abbas, owner of Gilgit Looms, said his business had also been badly affected, adding that he had invested billions of rupees, but now found it difficult to pay shop rent and salaries.

• Justice Mazhar stresses equality before law applies to state and private litigants alike
• Criticises routine govt pleas citing administrative delays as ‘mechanical and unpersuasive’
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Saturday emphasised that delay in invoking a lawful remedy by a person or entity, who was sleeping over their rights can be denied.
The observations came from a three-judge bench headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, while hearing a case involving the Sindh government.
The bench noted with concern the tendency of the federal and provincial governments, as well as autonomous bodies, to institute appeals after the lapse of the limitation period prescribed by law.
Authored by Justice Mazhar, the four-page order regretted that often the plea taken by the governments for condoning the delay was that fulfilling inter-departmental procedures and seeking final instructions from the competent authority delayed timely filing of the case.
Seemingly, applications for condonation of delay are being filed as a routine matter, while adopting a callous approach, which fails to recognise the delay cannot be condoned without the presence of sufficient cause or explaining delay of each and every day.
“The doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including the state, are accorded the same treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding the astuteness of the law of limitation does not confer a right but ensues incapacitation after the lapse of the period allowed for enforcing some existing legal rights and foresees the culmination of claims which have decayed by the efflux of time.
It is inherent duty of court to delve into the question of limitation, regardless of whether it is raised or not, he observed, adding carelessness, intentional sluggishness, or lack of bona fides could not be valid reasons for condoning a delay.
“We noted the mechanical and unpersuasive justification of administrative delays has almost become a trend, which is consistently pleaded for condonation of delay through stereotypical and generalised applications, which in our point of view cannot be considered ‘sufficient cause’ or a reasonable ground in every case,” the order said.
The issue arose when the Sindh government’s Land Acquisition Department challenged the April 12, 2022, order of the SHC’s Sukkur bench. In fact, the department had sought to contest a judgement passed on Feb 28, 2002, by the Referee Court/Additional District Judge, Sukkur, in Land Acquisition Reference/Suit No. 13 of 1989.
The SC noted that the civil appeal was time-barred by 30 days and the condonation application attached with the appeal does not specify any ground for indulgence of the apex court except few unconvincing and generic grounds.
No explanation was provided for the delay, nor was it clarified who was responsible for it. The court emphasised the question of limitation cannot be taken casually or unconscientiously. Any person or party wishing to file an appeal in a higher court must be vigilant and diligent in pursuing available remedy within the stipulated timeframe, the SC emphasised.
“If the department was negligent or reckless in causing the delay, then no premium can be placed on such conduct by granting condonation,” the court ruled. Consequently, the SC dismissed the civil appeal, both on merits and for being barred by time.

“In the light of the existing agreements between the UN and its host state, we all urge for this decision to be reconsidered,” Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s top diplomat, said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Kallas invoked “international law” in calling for Washington to reverse the extraordinary step, which further aligns US President Donald Trump’s administration with Israel’s government.
The US move comes as France is leading a push to recognise the Pales­tinian state at the gathering of world leaders in New York. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot spoke out in protest ahead of the Denmark talks.

Abbas ‘barred’ from UN summit; Israeli forces kill 50 more as death toll rises to 63,371

“A UN General Assembly meeting should not be subject to any restrictions on access,” Barrot told reporters.
A string of ministers in Copenhagen echoed France’s call for the United States to allow access to the Palestinian delegation.
The Palestinian Authority has likewise called for the United States to reverse its decision, which it said “stands in clear contradiction to international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement”.
 
 

Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, a veteran 89-year-old leader who once had cordial relations with Washington, had planned to attend the UN meeting.
Under an agreement as host of the United Nations in New York, the United States is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the world body.
A US official said on Saturday that Mahmud Abbas is among 80 officials being denied visas to attend next month’s UN General Assembly, where France is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state.
“Abbas is affected by this action along with approximately 80 other PA officials,” a State Department official said in a statement, detailing those impacted by the extraordinary decision announced on Friday by the United States.
The United States and Israel have accused France and other powers of rewarding Hamas through their recognition of a Palestinian state. Canada and Australia have also said they would recognise a Palestinian state, and Britain threatened to do so if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire in Gaza.
Meanwhile, heavy bombardment has been reported in Gaza City early on Saturday as Israel said its planned seizure of the besieged Palestinian territory’s largest area was progressing. At least 50 more people were killed in Gaza in a single day, taking the death toll of Palestinians in over 22 months to 63,371.

The newly created Pakistan Land Port Authority will act as a central platform for coordinating between multiple border management agencies. Its mandate includes facilitating the smooth movement of goods and passengers across land ports, reducing delays, and ensuring more efficient trade flows.
With this development, Pakistan becomes the third country in South Asia, after Bangladesh and India, to establish a dedicated land port authority.
The authority will introduce a robust mechanism to coordinate effectively with border management agencies, streamline trade facilitation, and enhance cross-border connectivity. It will also play a vital role in meeting Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements and conventions.
 
 

The establishment of the Pakistan Land Port Authority marks a significant step towards strengthening the country’s regional trade integration, improving border management, and enhancing economic connectivity with neighbouring countries.
Change in 11th NFC
In another significant development, President Asif Ali Zardari has approved a change in the constitution of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC).
According to the Presi­dency, the change became necessary after the government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non-ex officio member in the 11th NFC.
The president accorded approval to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The Balochistan government earlier withdrew the nomination of Farmanullah Khan, former CEO of the Balochistan Investment Board, and instead nominated Mahfooz Ali Khan to represent the province in the NFC.
This will be Mahfooz Ali Khan’s fourth term representing Balochis­tan in the NFC, as he has previously represented the province in the 5th, 6th and 7th NFCs.
He also held significant roles in the provincial government, including serving as an additional secretary and secretary of finance for six years. He retired as a Grade-21 officer in 2014 after serving as Balochistan’s secretary of finance.
In addition, he has held key positions such as Accounts General of Balochistan, Controller Military Accounts, and Director General of the National Institute of Manage­ment (NIM) Balochistan.
Petroleum Bill
President Zardari has also asse­nted to the Petroleum (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.
The Act strengthens measures against smuggling and illegal operation of petrol pumps.
It empowers deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and customs authorities to confiscate illegal petroleum products and vehicles, introduces IT-based tracking, and enhances penalties for violations.
The legislation is expected to modernise petroleum sector regulation, improve transparency, and strengthen the government’s effor­­ts against smuggling and tax evasion.
Besides, the president has also given his assent to the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.

• Transport alliance urges Punjab administrations to install diversion signs for container trucks
• Fertiliser shipments via flood-hit river corridors suspended
• Movement on highways still smooth
• Onion, potato supplies to Karachi decline
KARACHI: As various goods for import, export, and local consumption continue to move smoothly on motorways and highways, goods’ transporters have claimed that the ravaging floods in Punjab are causing delays on other routes.
They said shipments from the port city of Karachi to different parts of Punjab, as well as consignments arriving from Punjab to Karachi, are being delayed.
All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance President Nisar Hussain Jafri said that over the last three days, the supply chain has faced delays of two to three days. He added that excluding motorway routes, shipments of goods (both import and export items) from Karachi to various areas of Punjab usually take two to three days under normal conditions. The same time is spent on the return of empty or loaded containers from Punjab.
He said goods carriers are facing problems as the city governments in various areas of Punjab have not displayed diversion signs for container trucks. As a result, carriers often reach points where they cannot proceed further. He urged the administrations to install diversion signs to save diesel and time.
‘Fertiliser supply via flood-hit areas suspended’
Executive Director of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), retired Brig Shershah Malik, said shipments passing through flood-affected areas such as Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab had almost been suspended. However, the fertiliser movement on motorways and highways was still smooth, but “if floods prolong, fertiliser movement and consumption will definitely be impacted.
“In the next two to three days, floods will cross Multan and on Sept 6, 2025, will enter Sindh. After that, the actual ground situation will become clear,” he said.
He added that shipments to sales points in river corridors and across the rivers had been suspended, though fertiliser application in those areas had also stopped. Hence, there was no immediate chance of shortage in flood-affected regions.
President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, Super Highway, New Subzi Mandi, Haji Shahjehan, said onion supply from Balochistan and potato supply from cold storages had declined in Karachi due to rains and floods. Oil Companies Advi­sory Council (OCAC) Secretary General Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi said he had not yet noticed any disruption in oil supplies to the upcountry. “I do not know what will happen in the next couple of days,” he added.
Pakistan Pharm­aceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chai­rman Tauqeer-ul-Haq said that so far there had been no reports of supply disruption and that the supply of medical goods was continuing normally.
‘Floods pose risk to agri output’
Mohammad Shahroz of Insight Securities said recent flooding in KP and Punjab posed risks to agricultural output and supply chains, which could reignite supply-side inflationary pressures. “It is important to safeguard the nascent stabilisation and strengthen the economic base before shifting gears to growth,” he added.
He estimated headline inflation at 4.1pc for Aug 2025 compared to 9.6pc in the same month last year and 4.1pc in July 2025. On a month-on-month basis, inflation is expected to rise 0.4pc due to higher food prices, though this has been partly offset by lower electricity charges and declining LPG prices.

Sources said militants ambushed Bara Rifles’ 163 Wing in Upper Dir’s Barawal tehsil, leading to a fierce exchange of fire. The checkpost, which is a few hundred metres from the Afghanistan border, was initially overrun by the militants, but they were later repulsed by local volunteers who also joined the fight.
At least three soldiers laid down their lives, while three sustained injuries and moved to a nearby hospital. There were also reports of militant casualties as well, but it could not be confirmed.
The incident comes at a time of heightened militant activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s border districts, where security personnel and civilians have increasingly come under attack in recent weeks, rai­sing concerns among residents about the deteriorating law and order situation.
In Kohat’s Lachi tehsil, a police patrol came under fire, leading to the death of one policeman and injuries to two others. In a subsequent search operation, the police gunned down three militants. The identification process of the murdered militants was in progress, the police said.
He added that an operation was in progress to round up the injured militants while intense fighting with the militants was going on in the Paya area near the Hangu border.
In a separate attack in Mohmand, a police constable and two sustained injuries when militants attacked a post in the Pandiali tehsil on Saturday. DPO Ikramullah said that the attack occurred during a search operation in the Dawezai area of Pandiali tehsil. He said Constable Mohammad Arif was martyred in the attack, while constables Hayat and Ibrar were injured.
 
 

Sources said that the police and security forces continued a search and strike operation in different areas of Mohmand district, during which several suspected hideouts were destroyed.
Three killed in IBO
Separately, the security forces killed three terrorists, including a key commander, in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Loni area of Kulachi tehsil in Dera Ismail Khan.
According to the military’s media wing, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of militants in the area. During an intense exchange of fire, three militants were killed while a cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered from their possession.

• Urban flooding in KP areas leaves neighbourhoods submerged; minor dies in Peshawar
• Ghizer district faces increased flood risk due to glacier melt, PMD issues alert
LAHORE/ PESHAWAR / GILGIT: While severe flooding in Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers prompted mass evacuations across Punjab, the situation aggravated due to a renewed spell of downpour and a barrage breach in India, leaving Sindh to revise flood displacement estimate, now projecting over 1.65 million people at risk along both banks of the Indus River.
In the country’s northern parts, glacier melting threatened further floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer district as per Met Office warning and some Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, including Peshawar, recorded urban flooding amid heavy rains.
Authorities in Punjab are grappling with what they call an unprecedented hydrological crisis, as the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) and Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) report dangerously high water levels across key river sites, with several nearing or exceeding critical levels.
Millions of residents in low-lying areas of Punjab are being relocated as authorities struggle to manage what officials describe as an unprecedented hydrological crisis.
The combined inflow from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers continues to pose a severe threat to downstream regions, including Multan and Muzaffargarh. The flows from the three rivers are now halfway through Punjab.
 
 

At 6:30pm, the water levels have risen to 524.20 feet, dangerously close to the critical threshold of 526 feet at the Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River.
Water flow
According to the FFD data as of 12am on Sunday, the water flow at Marala and Khanki headworks on the Chenab River was 95,152 cusecs and 229,100 cusecs, respectively.
Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 203,862 cusecs, and so was Trimmu Headworks at 184,108 cusecs.
The Ravi River is also exhibiting alarming trends. Balloki Headworks was steady at an extremely high volume of 211,395 cusecs, while the flow at Shahdara was falling and stood at 90,500 cusecs. Jassar was also steady at 95,580 cusecs while Sidhnai was rising at 30,481 cusecs.
The Sutlej River continues to flow at exceptionally high levels. Ganda Sing Wala was steady at 253,068 cusecs, Sulemanki Headworks at 154,219 cusecs and Islam Headworks at 68,058 cusecs. Panjnad Headworks was rising at 73,166 cusecs.
On the Indus River, the outflow was recorded at 344,723 cusecs at Guddu Barrage, 256,660 at Sukkur Barrage and 236,223 at Kotri Barrage — all being in the “low flood” category.
Dykes breached
In a high-stakes operation to manage an unprecedented flood wave, provincial authorities were executing controlled breaches of protective dykes along the Chenab River at several locations. The strategy was followed to sacrifice thousands of acres of land to save critical barrages, bridges, and major urban centres in Jhang, Hafizabad, Sheikhupura, Nankana, and Kasur.
Around 850,000 cusecs of water were expected to reach Trimmu Barrage on Saturday night, and a controlled breach of the protective dyke was planned to save the headworks if the water levels exceed its capacity.
The authorities also installed ammunition in two flood dykes near Rangpur and Head Muhammad Wala, in case the flow increased to threaten Multan and Muzaffargarh within a day or two.
Speaking to the media, Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia warned that very high to exceptionally high floods will continue in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers until Sept 3.
According to the Flood For­eca­sting Division, under the influence of a monsoon low over north Madhya Pradesh, heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Bias and Ravi rivers from Sept 2-3.
Mr Kathia said that an exceptionally high flood level will continue in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu is expected to attain an exceptionally high flood level during Saturday night. He said that the Chenab at Panjnad is expected to attain a very high flood level on Sep 3.
The PDMA chief said floodwaters in Punjab’s rivers right now would meet at Head Panjnad on the night of Sept 4. “It will have a total intensity of 875,000-925,000 cusecs,” he said while speaking to the media.
He forecasted that the waters would then reach the Guddu barrage on Sept 6, with a high intensity of 975,000 to 1,050,000 cusecs due to possible rains.
He said that the floodwaters at Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River right now would reach Head Sulemanki in the next 24-36 hours and “achieve a peak”. Water flow would increase at Head Islam near Vehari in the next 48-55 hours.
Noting that there had been more rain, Mr Kathia said more water flows had entered from India into the Chenab River, leading to a medium-level flood at Marala.
Meanwhile, evacuations in low-lying areas of Pindi Bhattian, Chiniot, Hafizabad, Alipur Chatha, Jhang, Sillanwali, Athara Hazari, Rungpur, Khanewal, Kabirwala, Multan, Shujaabad, Jalalpur Pirwala and Muzaffargarh are ongoing.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan said that as many as 261,747 people were evacuated from the division, including 238,419 from Multan, 2,307 from Vehari, 17,068 from Khanewal and 3,953 from Lodhran. As many as 255,538 cattle were also evacuated.
The daily flood situation report, submitted to South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary and seen by Dawn, states that 478,270 people were affected and 514,434 acres of cropland were damaged due to flood in Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur divisions due to flood in Indus and Sutlej rivers. Over 267,683 acres of land were lost due to flooding in the Indus River in the DG Khan division.
Over 383,000 people and 140,000 livestock were evacuated, and 507 relief camps were established after a flood alert in the Chenab River.
1.65m people in Sindh at risk
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has revised its earlier assessment on potential displacement due to floods, now estimating that over 1.65 million people living on both the right and left banks of the Indus River are at risk.
Just a day earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority informed Sindh’s chief minister that more than 52,000 families could face displacement due to high water flows.
However, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, speaking at a press conference on Saturday, revised the figure, stating that the displacement risk could affect over 273,000 families, with 1,651 villages and 167 union councils at risk. He assured the public that the government was fully prepared to respond.
Also on Saturday, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was assured that all the barrages were under control and that all necessary safety measures had been implemented.
Flooding in Peshawar
According to the PMD, the provincial capital received 41 millimetres of rain, whereas heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in Khyber district also swelled the Budni and other nullahs, submerging low-lying areas along Warsak Road, Safia Town, Regi Model Town and Nasir Bagh.
Rain waters entered several houses in these areas, forcing the residents to leave their homes for safer places.
Rescue 1122 said that a roof collapse in the Nahaqi area on Charsadda Road left a minor girl dead, while a wall collapse in the Faqir Killay area of Warsak Road left a person injured.
 
 

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said that rescuers evacuated 300 individuals to safety. He said that the operations engaged over 280 rescue personnel equipped with water rescue vans, disaster-response vehicles, fire engines and ambulances.
He said that relief efforts focused heavily on vulnerable regions, inc­luding Nasir Bagh Road, Warsak Road and Budhni. “Rescue teams utilised rubber boats to safely evacuate elderly citizens, women, and children, prioritising their protection. Loudspeaker announcements along water channels were made to ad­­­vise people to stay vigilant and ta­­­ke precautionary measures,” he said.
Besides, he said that water levels at Budhni Nullah along Charsadda Road were gradually declining. Rescue 1122 teams have also been deployed in the Mian Gujar area.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority said that Budni nullah recorded medium-level floods after the rains. Water level in the nullah at Darmangi was recorded at 11,900 cusecs while Pir Bala stood at 9,000 cusecs.
In Khyber district, flash floods washed away a portion of the road in Jamrud as the region received torrential rains early on Saturday morning, suspending traffic on the Peshawar-Torkham Highway for several hours.
The road blockade also affected the integration of the returning Afghan nationals for nearly six hours at Torkham, as most vehicles carrying the Afghan returnees got stranded on the road at Katta Kushtha, where a portion of the road collapsed in gushing floodwaters.
The excessive rains and resulting floods in most water channels in Landi Kotal, Jamrud and Bara caused damage to houses, warehouses, shops and kiosks and swept away a motor car and damaging the boundary wall of a cricket academy in Bara.
Meanwhile, around two dozen students trapped in a flooded watercourse were rescued in the Lakki Marwat district on Saturday.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed officials to remain in the field until rescue and relief operations are complete and ensure the continuous presence of emergency teams until conditions return to normal.
According to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.
Ghizer faces rising flood risk
The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre issued a “Risk of Excessive Glacier Melt in Ghizer” alert, stating that the temperature at the Darkut station in Yasin Valley had reached 35 degrees Celsius.
The PMD warned that this soaring temperature could lead to excessive glacier melt in the upper areas of Ghizer, heightening the risk of glacial floods, flash floods in streams and nullahs and potential inundation of low-lying settlements.
Resident Gul Sher told Dawn that people in these villages are living in tents without basic necessities. “We have no access to drinking water and our children’s education has been severely affected as schools have been damaged and roads to these institutions are blocked,” he said.

Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil; a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
 
 

As ties between both nations deteriorate, NYT reported on Saturday that the breakdown in relations was caused after a phone call on June 17.
“After telling [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall, according to people familiar with the president’s schedule,” the NYT reported, citing “interviews with more than a dozen people in Washington and New Delhi”.
The NYT mentioned how Trump’s repeated claims about having ended the recent brief conflict between India and Pakistan reportedly “infuriated” Modi. The paper added that the dispute “dates back more than 75 years and is far deeper and more complicated than Mr Trump was making it out to be”.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“During a phone call on June 17, Mr Trump brought it up again, saying how proud he was of ending the military escalation,” the NYT reported.
“He mentioned that Pakistan was going to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour for which he had been openly campaigning. The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same.”
It added that the “bristled” Indian premier told Trump that American involvement had nothing to do with the ceasefire and the conflict had been settled directly between India and Pakistan.
“Mr Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,” the report reads, adding that the two leaders have not spoken since the June 17 phone conversation and Trump has only doubled down on taking credit for the ceasefire.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“At its core, the story of Mr Trump and Mr Modi is about two brash, populist leaders with big egos and authoritarian tendencies, and the web of loyalties that help keep both men in power,” the NYT reported.
“But it is also the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.”
Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Modi turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House after a G7 meeting in Canada, over concerns that he would set up a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was visiting the US at the time.
Reporting the same, NYT said: “Modi declined an invitation from Mr Trump to stop by Washington before he flew home. His officials were scandalised that Mr Trump might try to force their leader into a handshake with Pakistan’s army chief, who had also been invited to the White House for lunch around the same time. It was another clear sign, a senior Indian official said, that Mr Trump cared little for the complexity of their issue or the sensitivities and history around it.”
 
 

The COAS carried out two visits to the US. The first, in June, saw him meet Trump at the White House for luncheon, making him the first sitting army chief to do so.
The field marshal termed his second visit to the US in just one-and-a-half months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. During this trip, the COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Pakistan and the US also finalised a trade deal at the start of August, lowering tariffs to 19pc from the previously announced 29pc and helping develop Pakistan’s oil reserves while trade talks between the US and India have stalled.</p><small>2025-08-30 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/302105073b9c955.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938470/prime-minister-of-yemens-houthi-government-killed-in-israeli-strike-media-report' target='_blank'><strong>Prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government killed in Israeli strike: media report</strong></a><br><p>The prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government and several other ministers were killed in an Israeli strike on the capital Sanaa, the news agency run by the group said on Saturday, citing a statement by the head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat.
A number of others were wounded in the strike, carried out on Thursday, it said without providing details.
Israel said on Friday that the airstrike had targeted the Iran-aligned group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior officials and that it was verifying the outcome.
 






The Houthi-run news agency ran a statement from the defence minister shortly after it confirmed the prime minister’s death and quoted him as saying the group was ready to confront Israel.
The statement did not mention Thursday’s airstrike and it was unclear if it was made before or after the attack.
Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi became prime minister nearly a year ago, but the de facto leader of the government was his deputy, Mohamed Moftah, who was assigned on Saturday to carry out the prime minister’s duties.
Rahwi was seen largely as a figurehead who was not part of the inner circle of the Houthi leadership.
The Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck a compound in the Sanaa area where senior Houthi figures had gathered, describing the attack as a “complex operation” made possible by intelligence-gathering and air superiority.
On Thursday, Israeli security sources said the targets had been various locations where a large number of senior Houthi officials had gathered to watch a televised speech recorded by leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi.
The Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. They have also fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted. Israel has responded with strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.
“We remain steadfast in our genuine position of supporting and standing with the people of Gaza, and in building and developing the capabilities of our armed forces to confront all challenges and dangers,” Mahdi al-Mashat’s statement said.</p><small>2025-08-30 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/30165810b26f8f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938378/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-tianjin-for-sco-summit-modi-touches-down-in-china-after-7-year-gap' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Tianjin for SCO summit; Modi touches down in China after 7-year gap</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday he looked forward to meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping along with other world leaders as he arrived in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also touched down on his first visit after a seven-year gap.
The SCO summit, to be held in the northern port city of China’s Tianjin on Sunday and Monday, will gather more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Tianjin with Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
 






Terming his visit “historic”, PM Shehbaz said on X today: “I look forward to meeting H.E. President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to further build upon our bilateral ties with China, our All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner, as well as with other key countries of the region […]”
The premier expressed his aim to “enhance regional cooperation, strengthen multilateralism, and advance shared goals for peace and prosperity”.
 






According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) today, the premier is leading a delegation from Pakistan to participate in the SCO’s Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit from August 31 to September 1.
“The SCO CHS Summit will bring together heads of state and government from SCO member states, including Pakistan, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,” the statement read.
Leaders from Mongolia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkiye, Egypt, the Maldives, Myanmar and others, as well as the chief of the United Nations and heads of various regional and international organisations, will also attend as part of the expanded format.
“At the SCO CHS Summit, Prime Minister Sharif will present Pakistan’s perspectives on pressing regional and global issues, highlighting strategies to strengthen the SCO’s role in fostering regional cooperation and stability,” the FO stated.
 






PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
On the engagements in China, the FO said the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the FO added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” FO said.
 






Ahead of Pakistan’s participation in the summit, FM Dar also posted on X, saying: “Pakistan’s all-weather strategic partnership with China is anchored in trust and strategic alignment. We value President Xi’s leadership and initiatives such as the Belt and Road, and the Global Development, Security & Civilisation Initiatives, which continue to transform economies and strengthen regional integration.”
He added: “The SCO has become a pivotal Eurasian platform, advancing cooperation in security, trade, energy, connectivity, and culture under the principles of mutual trust and shared development.”
In today’s multipolar world, FM Dar said, the SCO’s role in promoting multilateralism, stability, and inclusive growth is more vital than ever.
 






Leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the 25th SCO Heads of State Council.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” an official announcement had said, quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative.
In July, the two countries decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies, and modern farming techniques.
Modi’s visit after 7-year break
Modi also arrived in Tianjin on his first visit to China since 2018, coming straight after a trip to Japan, which pledged to invest $68 billion in India.
 






China and India, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
A thaw began last October when Modi met with President Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia.
Xi began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is also due to arrive in Tianjin ahead of the summit.
China and Russia have used the SCO — sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated Nato military alliance — to deepen ties with Central Asian states.
Other leaders, including Iranian and Turkish presidents Masoud Pezeshkian and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will also attend the bloc’s largest meeting since its founding in 2001.
Multiple bilateral meetings are expected to be held on the sidelines of the summit.
The Kremlin said on Friday that Putin will discuss the Ukraine conflict with Erdogan on Monday.
Turkiye has hosted three rounds of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine this year that have failed to break the deadlock over how to end the conflict, triggered when Moscow launched its invasion of its pro-European neighbour in February 2022.
Putin will also meet with his Iranian counterpart Pezeshkian to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme on Monday, a meeting that comes as Iran faces fresh Western pressure.
Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, triggered a “snapback” mechanism on Thursday to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with commitments made in a 2015 deal over its nuclear programme.
Russia’s foreign ministry warned that the reimposition of sanctions against Iran risked “irreparable consequences”.
Tehran and Moscow have been bolstering political, military and economic ties over the past decade as Russia drifted away from the West.
Relations between them grew even closer after Russia launched its offensive against Ukraine.</p><small>2025-08-30 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621097-meet-the-viral-flood-reporter-making-waves-on-bhai-bhai-channel' target='_blank'><strong>'Bhai Bhai Channel'?
