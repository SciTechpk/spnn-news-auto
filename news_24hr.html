The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had on Dec 18 arrested the suspects for their alleged involvement in running a fraudulent Ponzi scheme network in Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The agency registered a case against the held suspects under various provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and the Pakistan Penal Code.
The investigating officer (IO) of the NCCIA claimed that they got a tip-off that some Chinese citizens and others were involved in an online fraud in the garb of running a call centre in DHA. A raid was carried out at the call centre and suspects were arrested after they failed to provide any legal document to justify their lawful authority to operate the call centre, it added.
The IO stated that the call centre employees lured ordinary citizens through social media advertisement to invest money, which they subsequently transferred into different bank accounts created to show fictitious investment growth and fabricated profits.
The IO produced the suspects before a judicial magistrate (East) and submitted that the investigation had not been completed and efforts were on to recover digital devices used in the commissioning of the alleged offences.
However, he asked the magistrate to send the suspects to prison due to security reasons.
The magistrate sent the suspects to jail on 14-day judicial remand and directed the IO to complete the investigation and file a report till Jan 2.

On Dec 20, a two-judge IHC bench headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar had ordered the removal of Justice Jahangiri after allowing a petition challenging the validity of his law degree. Subsequently, the president had also approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister on the same night.
In a statement, the KBA said only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is the constitutional forum to remove judges of the high courts and Supreme Court and any “executive or administrative process” is unconstitutional.
Bar President Amir Nawaz Warraich and General Secretary Ghulam Rehman Korai stated that the de-notification had been effected with extraordinary haste and in a manner manifestly inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of judicial independence, due process and institutional propriety.
“Such action directly impinges upon the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and poses a serious threat to the independence of the superior judiciary,” it added.
The KBA also stated that the removal of a sitting judge of IHC has been undertaken despite existence of disputed questions of facts, pending judicial proceedings, subsisting stay orders and complaints on the subject matter already seized by the SJC.
Under Article 209, the SJC is the sole and exclusive constitutional forum competent to inquiry into the conduct, capacity or removal of judges of superior judiciary and any parallel, executive or administrative process is ultra vires the Constitution, void ab initio and no legal affect, it maintained.
The KBA emphasised that the security of the tenure of judges was not a personal privilege but a constitutional safeguard designed to ensure fearless and independent adjudication.
“Any action that weakens this protection risks establishing a dangerous precedent, challenging judicial independence and exposing judges to external influence, contrary to settled constitutional jurisprudence and internationally recognised standards, including the UN Basic principles on the independence of the judiciary,” it added.
The KBA also reiterated that judicial accountability must be pursued strictly in accordance with the Constitution and law through transparent, fair and independent mechanism.

But after two National Guard soldiers were shot — one of them fatally — in Washington last month, allegedly by an Afghan national, their fates have been put on hold, and many are now terrified about what the future might bring.
“Everybody is scared,” a 31-year-old Afghan green card holder said.
“We are scared that we will be judged by people for the crimes committed by one individual from Afghanistan.” West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her wounds after what officials described as an “ambush-style” attack that also left fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, fighting for his life.
The following day President Donald Trump announced he was halting all migration from what he called “third world countries”, including Afghanistan, as his administration announced a review of all residency grants for people from 19 countries — around 1.6 million people, according to a tally. Now Afghans fear they might be sent back to a nation run by the Islamist extremists who they once worked to defeat.
“I made my home in America, now this is my home. If I leave here where I have to go then?” sobbed Maryam. Like all Afghan nationals this news agency spoke to for this story, Maryam did not want to be identified for fear of angering US immigration authorities.
“When I sleep my chest feels very painful, empty,” she said. “I feel like I belong to nowhere.”
The 27-year-old worked on projects for the US embassy in Kabul, where she helped produce education materials that she says cast the Taliban in a bad light.
When the American-led international force was there, her country began to modernise, giving rights to women that their mothers did not have.
“I did education, I had a big dreams for my country, for myself,” she said from her home outside Los Angeles. But in August 2021, the last US troops hurriedly withdrew from Afghanistan as the Taliban ran riot, taking over the institutions that American taxpayers had spent billions of dollars to prop up.
Hundreds of thousands of Afghans scrambled to leave the country, terrified that the Islamists would exact revenge on anyone who had helped the West. “It was so difficult to get into the airport,” said Khan, who describes printing out dozens of documents, including proof that his wife was a US citizen living in California.
“There was no water, no food, nothing. And we spent four days in there,” he said. “It was too cold during the night.” Khan, who worked in a university and at a government bank, finally got a plane to Qatar, then on to Germany before being flown to New Jersey, where he underwent two months of background checks and processing.
“We truly thank United States. They helped us a lot to come… and rebuild our life here.”

The country stood up to an aggressor much larger in size and resources, instilling renewed confidence and self-esteem in the Pakistani nation. It also discredited Indian narratives linking terrorism with Pakistan.
It all started with a terrorist incident in the Pahalgam area of Indian-occupied Kashmir last April. As usual, India’s knee-jerk reaction was to blame Pakistan.
However, this time around, the world refused to endorse India’s falsehood. Pakistan proposed impartial investigations, but India declined, and instead, carried out military strikes against nine targets in Pakistan on May 7. The latter responded robustly through a multi-domain, integrated and hybrid warfare. With seven of its planes down, including French Rafale, India sought help from the US for a ceasefire, but bizarrely, refused to acknowledge America’s role.

 

Ever since, India’s global profile has continued to fall in the eyes of the West, which was disappointed that the country that was being prepared as a counter-balance to China could not even handle Pakistan. A panicked Indian leadership decided to tilt towards Russia and China, which had their own questions about New Delhi’s viability as a strategic partner. India’s self-proclaimed strategic autonomy has become a difficult balancing act vis-à-vis major powers.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia entered into a strategic mutual defence agreement with Pakistan with a clause that aggression against one would be considered aggression against the other. This has added another layer to Pakistan’s deterrence regime against potential aggressors.
The US also broke its decade-long stalemate with Pakistan and began to explore investments in the latter’s mineral, oil and gas sectors. Pakistan was also invited to the high table to negotiate an end to the genocidal war Israel had waged against Palestinians living in Gaza.
For its part, China was pleased that some of its defence technology shared with Pakistan had been tested in a combat environment with favourable results. CPEC’s second phase has also been launched. Regional states, particularly Iran, Bangladesh and the Central Asian Republics, have further warmed up to Pakistan.

 

Going into the next year, worsening ties with the Afghan Taliban is a major concern for Pakistan. India, which had little feeling for the Taliban previously, has now embraced them to create a two-front situation for Pakistan.
India has kept open the option of resuming conflict with Pakistan through its Operation Sindoor, which is presently on pause. Given an unfavourable international environment and the embarrassing defeat in May, it is unlikely to resume kinetic aggression against Pakistan soon. However, most observers believe that India will increase its covert war against Pakistan through proxies such as the TTP and BLA. So, Pakistan will need to keep itself prepared to counter any potential Indian misadventure.

The world refused to endorse India’s falsehood.

Pakistan’s domestic scene has also seen progress. With inflation falling, fiscal deficits reducing, and reserves rising, the country continues on the path of economic stabilisation. The economy is increasingly being digitised, and efforts are underway to broaden the tax net.
However, we continue to live beyond our means. Floods have played havoc with those associated with agriculture. Unemployment, particularly among the youth, is another test for policymakers. Devolution of power and resources for local governments are largely missing, defeating the spirit of the 18th Amendment.
The security situation remains precarious, particularly in view of terrorist attacks by the TTP and BLA. One positive is the firm action taken against the TLP, sending a str­­­ong signal to radical groups that there would be zero tolerance for violent extremism.
At a time when the world order is under severe strain and international law is being violated with impunity, most countries are reflecting on their priorities, either leaning towards their own regions, or making alignments with like-minded countries, or opting for self-reliance. Since South Asia remains the least integrated region, due mainly to India’s hegemonic designs, Pakistan and other South Asian countries have few options but to fend for themselves.
In this turbulent era, Pakistan must seek ways to attain political stability and foster its economic resilience against shocks brought about by a chaotic world order. The leadership must undertake structural reforms for the economy and lessen the bureaucratic red tape that is strangulating potential investments. With dozens of reports containing doable recommendations already on the table, the question is not what should be done. The real test for policymakers is to muster the political will to do what must be done.

But any such move will not have a prayer unless both the hybrid set-up and the opposition step back from their confrontation.
After US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement at a briefing in Washington, expressing gratitude to Pakistan for “their offer to be part of it, or at least their offer to consider being part of it [the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza]”, what was clear was that issues remain to be addressed before any move forward on the matter.
Contacts have been going on since the ceasefire in Gaza in October this year. More recently, whe­ther it has been US-led activity in Doha or Florida or visits to Pakistan by the Jordanian monarch, the Indonesian president or the Egyptian defence minister, they all appear to be links in the same chain.
Around the time the October ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump, the perceptive king of Jordan made the observation, which is at the heart of the matter — that his country and other Muslim nations would have a ‘peacekeeping’ but not a ‘peace enforcement’ role.

 

This observation is what has triggered the contacts and conversations around the region and the world because regardless of what the US and Israel want, at least the prospective Muslim part of the ISF is reluctant, in fact adamant, not to play any role in ‘disarming’ Hamas.
For its part, Hamas has linked the laying down of its weapons to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which is nowhere on the cards, and said it would surrender weapons to a Palestinian state authority only after a complete cessation of the Israeli military operation and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. None of these conditions are likely to be met in the foreseeable future.

The state of the economy, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern.

There are indications that the Hamas stance is to take a tough negotiating position but it is also clear that if Israel, the apartheid state, also adopts a similar posture the whole process will begin to unravel or worse, stay locked in a state of suspended animation, with no end in sight for the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza in particular.
The last thing any Muslim contingent of the ISF would want is to be seen to be doing the genocidal Zionist state’s bidding. This will neither be acceptable to the leaders of any participating countries nor to their people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
Honestly speaking, even if the entire ISF were made up of contingents from non-OIC member states, even then any sane leaders/ commanders would be reluctant to take on Hamas in Gaza as it would be a pointless, long and bloody fight and one they would not win where the Israeli Occupation Forces failed.
There can be no doubt that Donald Trump has staked his personal credibility on the Gaza ceasefire and his own 20-point peace plan. Therefore, the efforts of the US administration members and officials seem aimed at delivering the plan.
Given what is in the public domain so far, it isn’t easy to assess how far the US can bend Israel to force the latter to enable conditions for a long-term peace to become a reality. Even then, it’s easy to say at this point that the doubters seem more credible than those who are optimistic.

 

With Trump now unleashing his fury on Europe, because he feels that it is less Russian President Vladimir Putin and more the leaders of the European Union and the UK who have not done enough to end the Ukraine war, God knows who will have to bear his wrath if his Gaza plan is slow to gain traction or if it fails.
For countries like Pakistan, there are two avenues of safety. One is safety in numbers. Its leadership should ensure, whatever the negotiations and the final position taken, that all OIC member states who have been asked to consider joining the ISF say exactly the same thing. They should evolve a consensus view and collectively own it.
For the resource-rich Gulf states and Indonesia, the fallout from a possible (and for the sake of the Gaza Palestinians one hopes that it never happens) collapse of the Trump plan will be minimal. I wish I could say the same for our IMF-dependent economy. We need to have all our ducks in a row. It is critical to make an effort at national reconciliation too.
There are many advocates of the so-called hard state in the media these days, with the voices calling for the opposite being far and few. But that does not mean the point they make is without merit. From the various courts sentencing the opposition leaders — from the top and middle tiers — to long jail terms, it is clear that protagonists of the hard state have the upper hand.
The state of the economy, which is the result of forever delaying structural reform, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. For any attempt at starting a national dialogue, temperatures will have to be lowered. As a first step, the rhetoric should be toned down. Personal attacks should be put on hold.
The hybrid set-up has seen through some serious challenges to its existence and now seems co­­m­­fortably ensconced in power. It should use its po­­­sition of strength to lay out reasonable terms for a dialogue. No matter how principled their position may be, it is time equally for the opposition leaders to practise politics as the art of the possible.
Confrontation has delivered nothing to them and kept the country on tenterhooks. People’s issu­­es are multiplying. The country won the war aga­inst the arch-enemy earlier this year. It is to time to bring the war within to a successful conclusion.

LAHORE: Despite being among the world’s largest producers of citrua, Pakistan is set to export only 400,000-450,000 tonnes of kinno during the 2025-26 season, well below its estimated potential of 700,000-800,000 tonnes, as growers and exporters struggle with high freight costs, border restrictions and the absence of effective government facilitation.
During the 2024-25 season, kinno exports stood at around 350,000-400,000 tonnes, with Russia, Indonesia, the UAE, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states as major destinations. For the current season, a slight improvement is expected due to better fruit size and quality in Sargodha and adjoining areas, but structural issues continue to cap growth.
Former MPA and large kinno orchard owner Faisal Cheema said the crisis has deepened despite an excellent crop. “By the grace of God, this year’s kinno crop is outstanding in both quantity and quality, but it has become a pattern that whenever the crop is good, it goes to waste. The Afghan border issue has been hurting us for the last couple of years, while the recent goods transporters’ strike caused further damages as we failed to meet some export orders due to unavailability of reefer containers,” he said.
Market prices have collapsed sharply during the season and orchard owners, out of panic, are selling their produce at whatever price is being offered. At the start of packing for Dubai exports, large size kinno fetched Rs120-125 per kg and smaller fruit Rs90-95 per kg, rates that held until Nov 30. By Dec 10, prices fell to Rs100 per kg for large fruit and Rs70 per kg for small. Between Dec 10 and 15, factories sold large fruit at Rs85-90 per kg and small at Rs55-60 per kg. After Dec 15, the situation became alarming, with factories offering barely Rs75 per kg for large fruit and Rs35-40 per kg for small — despite near-total buyer apathy.

Kabul border dispute and unstable markets put citrus sector at risk

According to industry estimates, traders are selling kinno to factories at Rs1,400-1,500 per maund, while factories have cut packing speeds drastically, daily operations halved from ten to five pickings causing repeated topping of orchards and severe damage to trees.
Sajid Tarar, a former president of the Sargodha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that border closures have brought the export chain to a standstill. “Over 100 factories did not open at all due to the Afghan border issue. Of the remaining units, most were already operating at around half capacity, and now closures are accelerating. Nearly 50 units are shut, with many more on the brink,” he said, cautioning that up to 800,000 workers could face unemployment if the crisis persists.
In a hint to the disturbing Afghan market, he said that some fruit had been going to Afghanistan through Iran, but the tensions on borders created a hostile atmosphere in Afghanistan against Pakistani products and a consignment of bananas was damaged by some people in the markets there.
Cold storages across Sargodha are reported to be 80-90 per cent full, putting kinnow worth millions of dollars at risk of spoilage. Growers fear losses of Rs8-10 billion, with ripple effects likely to hit future crops, including wheat and sugarcane, due to shrinking farm resources.
Stakeholders have urged the government to take immediate action by finding alternative international markets and routes for fruits, subsidising logistics, resolving border issue, and supporting exporters. “Saving kinno exports means saving farmers — and strengthening the national economy,” Faisal Cheema emphasised.

Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time.
In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination.
As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate.
One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit.

Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy

According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68.
But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses.

 

This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition.
Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available.
In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn, were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them.
Impact of digital currencies
Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks.
Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines.
Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”.
Dawn reached out to SBP for comment, but no response was received.

This is particularly pertinent in the myriad cases against the PTI’s senior leadership.
In most of these cases, justice has hardly been seen to be done because trials have been conducted with minimal transparency, with most proceedings held without neutral observers present to document arguments between the prosecutors and the accused.
Access to these proceedings for independent media has been poor and the public has not been able to meaningfully scrutinise the reasoning, evidence and legal thresholds applied in the cases against prominent public leaders. Instead, these cases have been tried in parallel in the national media, where government spokespersons have presented one version of events, and the defendants’ lawyers, a completely different one.
With trust in the judiciary wearing thin, it has been very difficult to weigh the merits of the various judgements passed against PTI leaders.
Another batch of such judgements landed this Friday and Saturday, in which almost the entirety of the party’s senior leadership was once again handed convictions, in separate cases, on charges ranging from terrorism to bribery and corruption.
PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry each received 10-year sentences in two separate May 9 cases, one decided on Friday and the other on Saturday.
Also on Saturday, party chief Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, were handed sentences of 17 years each for paying too little to keep a jewellery set gifted by an Arab royal.
All of these individuals now have a considerable record, yet the public has little insight into the reasoning by which their guilt was established.
Indeed, the way another PTI leader continues to be treated despite being exonerated in multiple cases raises further questions about what the convictions represent.
The counsel representing Shah Mahmood Qureshi have wondered when he will be granted bail, even though he has not been convicted in any case so far. Officially, he remains incarcerated pending court decisions on bail appeals in at least three other cases; however, given the consistent lack of evidence against him so far, it seems as if the reason for keeping him jailed has less to do with his alleged misdemeanours and more to do with his political affiliation.
This weakens the government’s narrative that it is merely bringing wrongdoers to book, and paints it, instead, as a hostile party that is punishing the political opposition, even when there are apparently few legal grounds to do so. It also undermines the judgements that continue to be handed down.

According to Met Office, landslides and snowfall may cause road closures/slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Gilgit, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch and Haveli on December 21.
It stated that a westerly wave was affecting western and upper parts of the country. Rain (snowfall over mountains) is expected in north/west Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, Islamabad and Potohar region. Cold and partly cloudy weather is likely in other parts of the country. Fog/smog is likely to persist over districts of eastern Punjab and upper Sindh.
Talking to Dawn, Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi said the administration was on its toes to deal with any situation after the prediction of snowfall in the hill station. He said all hurdles had been removed from main roads for the smooth flow of traffic and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority was in contact and had provided the required machinery to remove snow from the roads.

All hurdles removed from roads, machinery provided by PDMA to remove snow from highways, says DC

He said the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) had been asked to clean roads and its shoulders to avoid water accumulation and open drains before the snowfall. He said traffic police will ensure smooth flow of traffic.
“We allow more than 5000 vehicles to enter the city; however, the number will increase if traffic smoothly runs on the roads.” He said the health authority had already stocked life-saving medicine in the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital as well as dispensaries in all the union councils.
He said Rescue 1122 will remain on alert till the end of the winter season. Moreover, Civil Defence Department officials will also be deployed in different parts of the hill station.
To a question, the DC said road construction was being carried out at a few points but it would not affect the traffic flow towards the hill station. He said the district administration was monitoring the traffic situation through Safe City CCTV cameras.
Meanwhile, on the special instructions of Secretary Emergency Services Punjab Dr Rizwan Naseer and the Murree deputy commissioner, Rescue 1122 has finalised its preparations under an emergency cover plan.

However, the rains also disrupted normal life, suspending power supply and mobile networks, flooding roads and houses, and triggering road accidents that left two women dead and several others injured.
Clouds had been hovering over Quetta and adjoining areas for the past two days, though weather experts initially ruled out significant rainfall, describing the system over Balochistan as weak and unlikely to cause torrential rain. Contrary to these forecasts, rain began around noon in parts of the Quetta valley and soon intensified, spreading across the provincial capital.
As the rainfall strengthened, roads in urban areas were inundated with rainwater, leading to widespread traffic congestion. Power supply to Quetta was suspended shortly after the rain began, plunging large parts of the city into darkness. Mobile phone services and communication networks were also badly affected, causing inconvenience to residents. Severe traffic jams were reported on major roads, while public transport services were disrupted.
Low-lying and downstream areas of Quetta were among the worst affected, as rainwater entered houses, particularly damaging mud-built structures. The rainfall continued intermittently until late at night, and many residents hoped for snowfall due to the prevailing weather conditions. However, temperatures did not drop sufficiently to indicate snowfall.
Heavy rain was also reported in many other parts of northern, central and eastern Balochistan, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Harnai, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Loralai, Mastung, Noshki, Sibi and Bolan. In these areas, normal life was disrupted, power supply was suspended, and several localities remained without electricity until late night.
In a rain-related accident in the Noshki district, two women were killed and five others injured when a passenger wagon travelling from Quetta to Chagai skidded on a rain-slick highway near the Sher Jan Agha area and collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, with two later shifted to Quetta in critical condition. Hospital officials said at least eight people injured in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.

ISLAMABAD: As a court sentenced him to jail in the Toshakhana-II case, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday issued a call for a nationwide protest besides announcing his intention to challenge the verdict in the Islamabad High Court.
The PTI chief does not have access to his social media handles in jail.
“I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” he said as per the account of the conversation between the PTI leader and his lawyer posted on X.
He said his sentence in this case did not come as a surprise, but he had asked his legal team to move the high court against the decision. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me. This decision was given in haste by the judge without any evidence and without fulfilling the legal requirements,” he said, adding that his legal team was “not even heard”.
The PTI chief said it was inevitable for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and the legal community to “come to the front foot” for the supremacy of law and the restoration of the Constitution. He said that without justice, economic development was not possible.
‘Political revenge’
The PTI, in a statement, called the sentence “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation”.
The PTI leaders alleged that the conviction was merely an attempt to extend the incarceration of Imran Khan and provide temporary relief to a “petrified ruling clique”. They stated that the rule of law had been buried in Pakistan, with political revenge being systematically carried out through a “subservient” judiciary.

 

Addressing a press conference alongside PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja stated that the PTI founder had a meeting with his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and conveyed a message to the nation. He made his position absolutely clear, stating, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”
Salman Raja alleged that the case was based solely on promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
Mr Raja described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was exerted on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
Mr Qaiser stated that the current circumstances leave no option other than resistance. He emphasised that the resistance would be peaceful, democratic, and grounded in constitutional principles. He further asserted that PTI was seeking justice for its founder and would continue its struggle until it was served.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that even Imran Khan’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo” court announced the verdict. The sentence was the second for the same charge, which was a clear violation of the Constitution, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy, he said.
‘Pre-written script’
Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against him were being delivered under a “pre-written script”.
Ms Khan claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to 10 years or 14 years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.
According to Ms Khan, the PTI founder’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in “illegal solitary confinement”.
Separately, PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgement. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former premier and his wife were those of a “kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Mr Ayub added.

The hearing was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani, and the witness, Adnan Raza, appeared before the court.
The witness recorded his statement, saying that he and his family were politically affiliated with the PML-N.
Mr Raza stated that on April 8, 2017, the PTI founder made false allegations against PM Shehbaz, claiming that someone from the prime minister’s family had offered him Rs10 billion to remain silent over the Panama Papers case.
The witness added that Mr Khan repeatedly made these allegations.
He further testified that on May 9, 2017, he read in a newspaper that PM Shehbaz had sent a legal notice to Mr Khan regarding the allegations.
Mr Raza said the false claims damaged PM Shehbaz’s reputation and created public unrest against him, noting that the impact of these allegations was reflected in the PML-N’s defeat in his constituency.
The defendant’s counsel, Muhammad Hussain Chotia, cross-examined the witness.
In response to his queries, Mr Raza clarified that he did not claim all incidents occurred in Punjab. He added that he had watched the relevant statements of Mr Khan on television.
The witness stated it was incorrect to suggest that PM Shehbaz came to power through rigging with the help of the Election Commission of Pakistan by preparing Form-47.
He also said that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif was not disqualified due to the Panama Papers case but for not drawing a salary from his son’s company.
When asked if corruption led to PML-N’s defeat in his constituency, the witness replied that it was incorrect and attributed the loss to the ‘false allegations’ made by the PTI leader.
After the cross-examination was completed, the judge summoned additional witnesses for Jan 24.
Previously, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had also recorded statements as witnesses for the prime minister.
PM Shehbaz filed the suit in 2017, stating that the PTI founder had made baseless allegations against him.
He is seeking Rs10 billion in compensation and damages for the publication of defamatory content.

LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday stressed the need to fully utilise modern technology to upgrade the country’s immigration system while chairing a review meeting on the eradication of human trafficking and measures against illegal travel abroad.
Referring to recent reports and complaints regarding the offloading of passengers travelling abroad, he commended Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for personally visiting airports to review the situation.
He directed that while taking action against individuals travelling abroad illegally or holding dubious travel documents, special care must be taken to ensure that passengers with valid travel documents were not inconvenienced.
The prime minister also instructed that the performance of the Protectorate of Emigrants be further improved and coordination with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other relevant institutions be strengthened to facilitate those travelling abroad legally for employment.
During the meeting, it was informed that the FIA had arrested 451 individuals involved in human trafficking and illegal travel this year.
Due to these efforts, the number of Pakistanis travelling illegally to Europe had declined by 47 per cent, while reductions had also been recorded in cases of travel on illegal documents to the UK and Gulf countries.
The participants were further told that illegal migration, misuse of work, visit and tourist visas, off-loading, and deportation remained major challenges in European countries.
Most deportations involved passengers returning from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Malaysia and Oman.
The meeting was further informed that a risk assessment unit was operational within the FIA, enabling targeted screening of passengers and systematic recording of data related to deported and illegal travellers.
It was also highlighted that 196 FIA officers and personnel had been dismissed after corruption was proven against them.
The participants were informed that work was underway to activate the e-gate system at airports. Access to API-PNR data will be enabled to help identify potentially illegal travel documents in advance.
In addition, a mobile phone application is being developed for passenger data, the FIA’s IBMS and IT sections are being restructured, and artificial intelligence is being utilised to prevent illegal travel.
‘Increase in exports essential’
Separately, while chairing another review meeting on domestic exports, PM Shehbaz said a sustained increase in exports was essential for the country’s economic development and long-term stability.
PM Shehbaz directed the federal ministers for commerce, industry and production and national food security to personally visit exporters in various industrial and commercial cities to understand their issues and ensure timely resolution.
The prime minister also underlined the need to further strengthen coordination with the provinces to promote cold chain systems and other sectors linked to industry and trade.
During the meeting, the premier was briefed on exports and imports for the ongoing fiscal year so far, along with measures being taken to improve export performance.

Police officials said the operation was launched after security agencies received information abo­ut militants hiding in the area. Acting on the tip-off, security forces cordoned off the locality and eng­aged the suspects, resulting in the killing of five militants.
The officials said the group was involved in sabotage activities and had been using the area as a base to plan attacks.
Following the encounter, security forces carried out a search and clearance operation in the surrounding areas to trace any possible accomplices. Law enf­orcement agencies were placed on high alert, while security checkpoints in and around Bannu were strengthened as a precautionary measure.
Police sources said security operati­ons had been intensified across the district in view of recent security threats. They said coordination among police, security forces and intelligence agencies remained strong to counter terrorism.

Amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs, the Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges has approved an amendment to Rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate. Backers say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in parliamentary matters by relying on the rule in its present form.
The proposed amendment, spearheaded by former deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwalla and signed by around three dozen lawmakers, expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.

Proposed rule change seeks to shield upper house committees from stay orders

It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso proposed to be added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition proceeds. It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the Chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its current form states: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a Committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the Government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
The ministry proposed retaining the latter portion of the original rule as a second proviso, but the committee rejected the suggestion.
During the meeting, held with Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi in the chair, Mr Mandviwalla raised concerns over what he described as judicial interference in committee proceedings. He emphasised courts had no authority to interfere in parliamentary affairs and noted that the Supreme Court had repeatedly directed that parliamentary proceedings should not be obstructed.
He recommended that the Senate should not compromise the authority of its committees and, while exercising the powers of the House as representatives of the public and as oversight bodies, must remain fully empowered to take up matters of public importance.
Mr Mehdi reiterated that parliament was the supreme institution and said its organs must be empowered to address issues affecting individuals and groups of citizens. However, he cautioned that committees must strictly refrain from taking up or discussing sub judice matters.
Senator Saadia Abbasi opposed the proposed amendment, saying every institution should operate within its constitutional domain and avoid interfering in the functions of others.
The meeting was attended by Senators Saadia Abbasi, Dost Ali Jeesar, Asad Qasim, Jan Muhammad and Palwasha Khan. Senators Mandviwalla, Shahadat Awan and Syed Masroor Ahsan also attended as movers, while Senator Bilal Khan Mandokhail attended as a special invitee.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Mandviwalla said he was confident the amendment would be passed by the House and would “put a full stop” to judicial interference in parliamentary affairs. “And if it does not stop even then, we will move the appropriate forum for action against those found responsible,” he said.
The move follows a dispute this year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees. On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mr Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mr Mandviwalla described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, endorsed the concerns. On Aug 18, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure, but insisted that the bar was not absolute.

The two made the remarks in an interview with British journalist Mehdi Hasan, a four-minute preview of which is available to the public on Zeteo’s website. The full interview is behind a pay wall.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
In the interview with Hasan, Kasim and Sulaiman, were asked about the government’s claims of treating Imran like a “prince” during his incarceration.
“Couldn’t be less true,” replied Kasim. He said that Imran was being held in a cell that was six by eight, “barely enough to stand”.
“The conditions are awful. He is washing himself in brown, murky water. And the food he has is — he is not the one to complain — but it’s apparently dreadful. To be a prince is far from it,” he said.
Kasim also recalled Imran’s recent meeting with his sister Uzma, saying the former premier was “pretty furious from what we have heard.”
“He was just unhappy with the … complete isolation. They’re not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person just to try and break him,” he said.
“So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.

During the interview, Hassan also asked the two about the last time they were able to speak to their father.
In response, Sulaiman said he last spoke to Imran “at the end of July”.
“The court in Pakistan mandates that we have weekly calls but that’s just never been followed throughout his time in prison, which is over two years now,“ he said.
“I spoke to him for about six minutes last, around September,” Kasim said.
Sulaiman said that the last time they had met Imran was in November 2022, following an assassination attempt on the PTI founder’s life. “We went there for a week I think,” he said.
In a separate clip posted on Zeteo’s Instagram account, the journalist asked the two if they were worried by Imran’s “statements” against the Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Hasan then read out the statements posted from Imran’s X account.
“It does but that is his character,” Sulaiman said.
“Do you ever tell him to tone it down?” Hasan asked.
At this, Kasim laughed and said: “No, he goes headfirst into danger historically, and we kind of accepted it at a young age that he was going to go into very dangerous situations.”
Sulaiman recalled that when he was young, he feared for his father’s life, but added that he eventually got “used to it”.
Kasim noted that his father was a “man of faith”, adding that he always maintained that God would protect him.

Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, in response to the interview, dismissed the claims made by Imran’s sons on his alleged “isolation”.
“He does not spend any time at all in a ‘cell’. As a prisoner whose security and well-being [are] a priority for the state, he has designated living quarters,” Zaidi said in comments to Zeteo.
“He has his own gym facilities, his own outdoors lawn, his own space for walking and his own space for books and reading,” he added, adding that no other prisoner enjoyed the “space and leeway” Imran had.
He claimed that Imran’s children and supporters were being “misled by disinformation”.
“He spends at least six hours a day outside the area where he sleeps. He has a cook exclusively assigned to him, and a medical officer in the prison checks every meal he eats,” Zaidi said.
Speaking about Imran’s sons visiting Pakistan, Zaidi said that his children “will be treated with the rights and privileges due to all visitors to Pakistan —as per their status under the law [….] We hope the children have a chance to meet their father — but it is almost certain that the father and his political workers will try to exploit any visit by the children as a political event.”
“In that scenario, the local authorities will take whatever measures they need to take to disperse crowds and to ensure that political activity does not create the space for lawlessness and disorder,” Zeteo quoted him as saying.
Earlier this week, in an interview with Sky News, the brothers shared they had applied for their visas and were planning a trip to Pakistan in January. During the interview, they also commented on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”.
In July, they met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell in relation to their father’s release.
‘Don’t play the sympathy card’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, while speaking to the media in Faisalabad on Saturday, dismissed the allegation that the former premier was being kept in isolation, warning his family and the party not to play the “sympathy card”.
“How could he (Imran) be alone in a jail that has 1,200 inmates?” the minister asked, saying that Imran had access to gym equipment, a personal cook, among other facilities.

         View this post on Instagram            

“The whole area is operated as per his will,” he said. The minister said that Imran’s communication with his sons included phone calls “totalling over 14 hours”.
Addressing the matter of their visa, the minister recalled Imran‘s sister Aleema’s claim that the ex-premier’s children were being denied a visa, adding that he had asked her to share their tracking number.
“Till today, I have not received tracking numbers … we are very clear that anyone who wants to come to Pakistan, we will issue them visas within a few hours,” he said.
He noted that for over two years now, Imran‘s sons “had not renewed their National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), and they have not applied for visas as per our records“.
“If they have, give us the tracking number, and I assure you that they can come to Pakistan,“ the minister said.
“He is their father; they can come and stand with him and meet him,” the minister said. However, he warned them against “playing the sympathy card”.
“Do not try to gain sympathy by saying that the kids are being kept away from their father,” the minister said.
“I assure you, apply for a visa, and we will issue it immediately,” the minister reiterated.</p><small>2025-12-20 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20230315ec6d165.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962277/road-accidents-involving-heavy-vehicles-claim-three-lives-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Road accidents involving heavy vehicles claim three lives in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Reckless and negligent driving claimed the lives of three people in as many fatal accidents on Saturday, according to police and rescue services officials.
According to a statement from the Karachi Traffic Police, a trailer driver was involved in “negligent and careless driving” when he hit a motorcycle on Mauripur Road, injuring its two passengers.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said they were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, where one of them died.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that, according to the initial probe, the fatal accident was caused by over-speeding, which led the motorcycle to slip and the trailer’s rear wheels to crush the teenage rider.
He said the driver was arrested and the trailer seized by Mauripur police.
In another incident, a motorcyclist was killed when a trailer hit him on the main Super Highway near the Toll Plaza, according to a statement from an Edhi Foundation spokesperson.
Gadap City Station House Officer Sarfraz Jatoi confirmed the incident, adding that the injured motorcyclist was taken to a private hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said 17-year-old victim sustained crush injuries to his skull and face during the Mauripur accident.
She added that the body of the Super Highway accident victim was brought to a hospital in the evening for legal formalities.
In a third incident, DIG Raza said the front left-side tyre of a water tanker burst around 8:15pm near Habib Chowrangi on Star Mill Road in the Site Area. As a result, a motorcyclist, an unidentified man aged around 25 to 30, came under the vehicle’s wheels and was killed on the spot.
The DIG said the body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for completion of legal formalities, and further legal proceedings were under way in accordance with the law.
The latest deaths come against the backdrop of a worrying increase in fatal road accidents involving heavy vehicles, particularly water tankers and dumpers, across Karachi.
Last week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.
The week before that, a first-year college student and a 12-year-old boy lost their lives in separate incidents after being hit by water tankers in different parts of the city, triggering renewed concerns over reckless driving, poor enforcement of traffic laws and the unchecked movement of heavy vehicles in densely populated areas.
Last month, angered citizens also set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it met with an accident, resulting in the death of a man. His wife was injured in the incident.

Russia has unleashed an almost continuous drone and missile campaign against a region where ports key to Ukraine’s foreign trade and fuel supplies operate, after Moscow threatened to cut “Ukraine off from the sea”.
Strikes have escalated even as the United States pursues an uphill diplomatic drive to coax a deal to end the war. Ukraine held talks with the US team on Friday, and American negotiators were set to meet Russian officials in Florida today.
“The situation in the Odesa region is harsh due to Russian strikes on port infrastructure and logistics. Russia is once again trying to restrict Ukraine’s access to the sea and block our coastal regions,” Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv.
Russia’s aim is “to sow chaos, to exert moral pressure during winter … so that there is no fuel, no food supplies, so that there are problems with medical supplies”, he said.
Russia’s attack on Pivdennyi port today hit reservoirs, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on the Telegram messaging app, a day after a missile strike on the port killed eight people and injured at least 30.
Geneva-based vegetable oil producer Allseeds said three tanks storing sunflower oil at the site were set ablaze in Pivdennyi, and one of its workers was killed and two were injured.
Russia’s Defence Ministry was not available for immediate comment. The Kremlin has said Ukraine’s economic infrastructure is a legitimate military target in the almost four-year-old full-out war.
Focus on Odesa
Since Thursday, Russian forces have hit a bridge on the Dniester River near the village of Mayaky, southwest of Pivdennyi, at least five times, Kuleba told reporters.
The bridge, which connects parts of the region divided by the river and sea inlets, is the main transport route westward to border crossings with Moldova, and is not operational now.
The route accounts for around 40 per cent of fuel supplies to Ukraine, Kuleba said.
Ukrainian authorities have set up a pontoon bridge and rerouted logistics through other regions, securing civilian and freight logistics.
“The focus of the war may have shifted towards Odessa,” Kuleba said, adding that the “crazy” attacks could escalate even further as Russia tries to undermine Ukraine’s economy.
Last week, one of the war’s biggest Russian air attacks on the Black Sea region damaged energy facilities and prompted a blackout in the biggest seaport, Odesa, plunging hundreds of thousands of civilians into darkness for days.
Airstrikes on ports also damaged three Turkish-flagged vessels in December.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to cut Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea in retaliation for Kyiv’s recent drone strikes on Moscow’s sanctions-busting “shadow-fleet” tankers.
Ukraine says those vessels are used to transport oil, Russia’s main revenue source for funding its almost four-year-old full-scale invasion of its neighbour.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/201028323317941.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962237/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-sentenced-to-17-years-in-toshakhana-2-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years in Toshakhana 2 case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case.
The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m.
The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated.
Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions.
Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time.

Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.”
It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”.
Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
PTI slams verdict
The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”.
“A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further.
“They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped.







Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision.
Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.

According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement.
Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added.







A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”.
The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said.
“This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said.
The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”.
The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”.
It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced.







Minister says sentence to run consecutively
Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use.
He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”.

         View this post on Instagram            

“During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use.
“They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”.
“The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”.
He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”.
“The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said.
“The gift was not even submitted,” he added.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference.
“The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said.
“Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state.
He said the entire case against Imran was documented.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2020392152f3f2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962272/yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-by-lahore-atc-in-additional-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, other PTI leaders sentenced to 10 years by Lahore ATC in additional May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed to 10 years in prison terms in two more May 9 cases.
The latest court verdict comes a day after a Lahore ATC acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years in prison in another case related to the May 9 riots.
Rana Mudassar, the counsel for the PTI leaders, confirmed the development to Dawn, saying the cases are related to the burning of police vehicles in Lahore’s Gulberg and the burning of a container near Kalma Chowk during the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.
On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against Imran and his party, booking the party founder and its leadership in multiple cases.
ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed presided over the hearings for both cases today in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. A total of 22 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while five were acquitted in the Kalma Chowk case. In the Gulberg case, the judge handed down sentences to five, including the PTI leaders, while acquitting 22 others.
The judge noted that former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not yet been indicted in either case and his trial would proceed separately once a supplementary challan was submitted by the prosecution.
According to the prosecution, a total of 78 witnesses were presented in both cases. In the Gulberg case, a challan was filed against 33 individuals, while four others were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial.
In the Kalma Chowk case, the prosecution filed a challan against 36 people, while 12 others, including Hammad Azhar, Murad Saeed, Zubair Niazi, and Mian Aslam Iqbal, were declared absconders.
The prosecutor argued that PTI leaders had instigated party workers to revolt and create public disorder.
Talking to the media later, PTI’s counsel said the cases were scheduled for routine proceedings, but “sentences have been handed down once again in the darkness of night”.
He added that the defence was not given the chance to fully present its case.
“The morale of the prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail is high. So far, the leaders have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years,” the counsel said, adding that the sentences would be challenged in the high court.
With these verdicts, decisions have now been announced in seven of the 14 cases related to the May 9 riots registered in Lahore. Verdicts had previously been announced in trials concerning an attack on Shadman Police Station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House, and an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2019390113cf4af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962271/elders-of-kps-tirah-agree-to-vacate-homes-ahead-of-military-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Elders of KP’s Tirah agree to vacate homes ahead of military operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration.
The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage.
Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley.
Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed.
They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers.
Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added.
The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination.
It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026.
A representative jirga of Tirah elders had earlier presented a list of demands to security and administrative officials, which included Rs8 million and Rs4 million as compensation for fully and partially damaged houses, respectively, along with Rs500,000 for every departing family.
The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation.
Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs).
They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups.
Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs.
However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe.
“It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn.
The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation.
Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials.
Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen.
He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts.
Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley.
In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts, which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.</p><small>2025-12-20 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640582-yasmin-rashid-ijaz-chaudhry-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-in-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, other PTI leaders sentenced to 10 years in May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>

He served as the vice chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), which set up a camp years ago on Quetta’s Adalat Road, a site that has long stood as a symbol of protest against enforced disappearances in Balochistan.
VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch confirmed the rights activist’s passing to Dawn, saying: “He had been ill for a long time and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Quetta for the past two months.”
The group’s chairman added that the funeral prayers and burial would be performed on Sunday in Shaheed Sikanderabad district.

 

Baloch said the deceased’s struggle had remained prominent in human rights circles across the country.
In November 2011, Qadeer received the mutilated body of his son, Jalil Reiki, who was the information secretary of the Baloch Republican Party. The kidnapping and subsequent death of his son further galvanised the advocacy group, strengthening its efforts to support families enduring similar tragedies.
In 2013, the activist led a long march on foot from Quetta to Islamabad, joined by other Baloch men and women, to protest against enforced disappearances.
Since its inception, VBMP has raised its voice against the enforced disappearances of students, political activists and other civilians.
‘Legacy will endure’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) mourned the death and paid homage to the deceased activist.
“His legacy will endure in the countless families he stood beside. We reiterate that the state must take concerted action to restore the rights for which Mama spent decades campaigning.”







Advocate Rahab Khan Buledi, chairman of the Balochistan Bar Council’s Executive Committee, paid tribute to Qadeer in a statement.
“Mama Qadeer Baloch had been peacefully struggling for the recovery of missing persons for a long time. His democratic struggle is commendable. He was a strong voice of the oppressed,“ he said, adding that the council also paid homage to him.
Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal hailed him as a “symbol of resistance against state oppression, enforced disappearances and injustice.
”Despite immense personal loss and relentless hardship, he never abandoned the families of the disappeared or his demand for truth and accountability. Mama Qadeer’s struggle was not just personal, it embodied the collective pain and political resistance of entire people.“







Former senator Afrasiab Khattak said Qadeer “epitomised” the struggle for the recovery of all missing persons and would be remembered for his “fearless and valiant struggle”.







Advocate and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir said the “heartbreaking” news was a “huge loss” to the country’s human rights movement.
“Mama Qadeer will forever remain etched in our hearts and minds.”







“He will always be remembered for his struggle against enforced disappearances, for demanding justice for the Baloch and for standing bravely in the face of oppression,” said National Democratic Movement Chairman Mohsin Dawar in a post on X.
Journalist Kiyya Baloch said Qadeer left behind a legacy of “more than 16 years of non-violent struggle that continues to inspire today’s peaceful resistance against enforced disappearances”.
“He sat for endless days in front of the Quetta and Karachi Press Clubs and marched for countless miles all in the service of his people. May Mama Qadeer’s struggle to end the cruel practice of enforced disappearances someday be successful,“ said academic Nida Kirmani, a professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

The absence of references to Trump was notable given that pictures and documents related to him have trickled out of previous Epstein releases for years. Trump’s name appeared in flight manifests listing passengers on Epstein’s private plane that were part of a first batch of Epstein material the Justice Department released in February, for instance.

 

The partial release was intended to comply with a law overwhelmingly passed by Congress in November that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files, despite the Republican president’s months-long effort to keep them sealed. The scandal surrounding Epstein has become a self-inflicted political wound for Trump, who for years had promoted conspiracy theories about Epstein to his supporters.
It was not immediately clear how substantive the new materials were, given that many Epstein-related documents have previously been made public since his 2019 death in jail, which was ruled a suicide. Many of the files were heavily redacted — several documents with 100 pages or more were entirely blacked out — and the Justice Department acknowledged it was still reviewing hundreds of thousands of additional pages for possible release.

 

The material included evidence from several investigations into Epstein, along with photos of Clinton, long scorned by Republicans. But they appeared to include few, if any, photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s, before they had a falling out before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008.
Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied knowing about Epstein’s crimes.
‘This isn’t about Bill Clinton’
The Justice Department sought to draw attention to Clinton, with two agency spokespeople posting on social media images that they said showed him with Epstein victims.
Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said in a statement that the White House was attempting to “shield themselves” from scrutiny by focusing on the former president.
“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” he wrote.
Trump ordered the Justice Department last month to investigate Clinton’s ties to Epstein, in what critics viewed as an effort to shift the focus away from his own relationship with Epstein.
In images released on Friday, Clinton can be seen in a swimming pool with Maxwell and another person whose face is blacked out. In another image, he can be seen in a hot tub with what appears to be another person whose face is blacked out. Clinton has previously expressed regret for socialising with Epstein and said he was not aware of any criminal activity.
There were more than 1,200 victims or their relatives whose names must be redacted from the files, said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in a letter to Congress.
In a statement, the White House claimed the release demonstrated its transparency and commitment to justice for Epstein’s victims, criticising previous Democratic administrations for not doing the same.
But the statement ignored that the disclosures occurred only because Congress forced the administration’s hand, after Trump officials declared earlier this year that no more Epstein files would be made public.
Some lawmakers immediately criticised the administration for failing to release all of the files.
“This set of heavily redacted documents released by the Department of Justice today is just a fraction of the whole body of evidence,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
Republican US Representative Thomas Massie, a driving force behind the legislation, said on X that Friday’s release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law”.







The disclosure law required the Justice Department to turn over information about its handling of the Epstein investigation, including internal reports and emails. None of those materials appeared to be in the batch of documents the government released on Friday.
The law allowed the Justice Department to withhold personal information about Epstein’s victims as well as material that would jeopardise an active investigation.
Trump voters frustrated
Many Trump voters had accused his administration of covering up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscuring details surrounding his death in a Manhattan jail, where he was awaiting trial on charges of trafficking and abusing underage girls.
Just 44 per cent of American adults who identify as Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, compared to his 82pc overall approval rating among the group, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The issue has damaged Trump’s political standing ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress is at stake.
Last month, Democrats in the House of Representatives released thousands of emails obtained from Epstein’s estate, including one in which Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls”, without clarifying what that meant. Trump, in response, accused Democrats of promoting the “Epstein Hoax” as a distraction.
House Republicans released more emails the same day, including one saying Trump visited Epstein’s house many times but “never got a massage”.
Previous disclosures have revealed that even after his 2008 conviction, Epstein continued corresponding with high-profile figures, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Clinton’s former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, PayPal founder Peter Thiel and Britain’s former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his royal title over his links to Epstein.

He expressed these views in the inaugural address at the two-day national conference titled “Protection of the Consensus Constitution: The Need of the Hour and a Way Forward through Collective Wisdom”, organised by TTAP - an alliance of opposition parties.
The opposition alliance had announced the national conference after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
“The current situation in the country is such that the Constitution and the law have been torn to shreds, and raising one’s voice against it is the responsibility of every conscious citizen,” Achakzai said.
The veteran politician said that until now, they had remained under the illusion that at some stage constitutional supremacy would be established in the country, but that these hopes were now fading.
He stressed that all political forces must rise above temporary party interests, power-sharing considerations, and political affiliations, and think seriously about formulating a consensus course of action.
Achakzai said, “It has now become inevitable to raise a fundamental question: Is this country meant for the military, or is the military meant for the country? If the military is subordinate to the country, then what is the justification for constitutional exemptions?”
Speaking about negotiations with the government, he said it must be clear who the talks would be held with, on what points, and under what conditions.
“The first prerequisite for paving the way for negotiations is the immediate lifting of restrictions on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan by his family members, lawyers, and political leaders.”
“On the one hand, meetings with Imran Khan are being restricted despite court orders, while on the other hand, those who go to meet him carrying court orders are subjected to state violence and cases are registered against them—an outright injustice,” he said.







He further said that no army can fight a war or achieve real victory without the support of its people. He appealed to all political parties, civil society, and various schools of thought to step forward, raise their voices, and offer suggestions so that the country can be taken out of this dead end.
‘Marshal law has been imposed’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, speaking on the occasion, claimed that a “martial law has been imposed in the country”.
“When courts can’t do justice, judges can’t protect themselves in court, and civilians can’t protect themselves before judges in open court, the judiciary becomes irrelevant,” he said.







Gohar questioned how judges could maintain the “supremacy of law and the Constitution” if they could not protect themselves.
Referring to today’s judgment, in which PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 17 years in prison, Gohar said the “entire Pakistan is sad.”
“We were thinking maybe the convictions would end after May 2025, and we would walk towards justice. We tolerated everything and didn’t resort to disruption. We didn’t stage sit-ins. We didn’t take the law into our own hands. We kept hope alive that our leader would be released [from jail] and we would move forward, and the paths would open.“
“The path will open for the Constitution, law and order, and democracy. But every day, decisions are issued that are above the law and the Constitution, and they spread despair among the masses.”
Speaking about the convictions of PTI leaders, Gohar said, “Our leadership was convicted yesterday… They have been sentenced to around 70 years in total. Today, another decision is yet to come. It is expected that the leadership will be sentenced to 10 years. Another case will be taken up against them on Monday, in which the judge has said, ‘He will issue the verdict.’”
“The leadership’s sentence will be 70 years in total, while Bushra Bibi and Khan’s sentences will total 60 years. Seven cases against the PTI leadership are pending. If they are sentenced to 10 years in each of them, their total sentence will reach 140 years.”
“Till when will these sentences be issued? Every day, we hope that we will walk towards a path where the masses will get justice. Judges are no longer safe. Judges of civil courts, district courts, high courts, and the Supreme Court are not safe,” he said.
“Khan and Bushra were sentenced in a case in which all gifts were declared.”
“One of the items from the Toshakhana was again presented, and a trial was conducted in which Khan was sentenced. This is the first time in the history of the country that a person has been convicted multiple times in one case.”
“This is beyond the law and the Constitution,” he said, adding that it is visible even to a law student that “decisions are coming from somewhere else”.
“We were expecting 2026 to be a new year, a new hope, with a new path, but unfortunately, some people were barring the way for the masses. I appeal to them not to bar the way for the masses. When leaders don’t do that, the masses will find the way on their own,” he said.
On the first day of the conference, various political leaders participated, including the PTI chairman, Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Asad Qaiser, BNP chief Akhtar Mengal, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Javed Hashmi, Mohsin Dawar, Afrasiab Khattak, Safdar Abbasi, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, Syed Zain Shah, as well as journalists, lawyers, and other representatives of civil society.</p><small>2025-12-20 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20162018510af40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252/bangladesh-holds-state-funeral-for-slain-youth-leader-amid-tight-security' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh holds state funeral for slain youth leader amid tight security</strong></a><br><p>Tens of thousands of Bangladeshi mourners, including the country’s interim government leader, attended the funeral on Saturday of a slain youth leader and election candidate amid tight security.
Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died on Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
His death has prompted a wave of unrest in the South Asian nation that included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions.

 

Police and paramilitary forces were deployed across the capital for Saturday’s funeral, but there were no reports of any renewed violence.

Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said Hadi’s legacy would endure, describing the funeral as a collective pledge to uphold the ideals he had championed.
“Today, we have come to promise you (Hadi) that we will fulfil what you stood for,” Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the mourners, who included Bangladesh’s army chief and representatives from across the political spectrum.
In a rare and symbolic honour, Hadi was laid to rest on the Dhaka University campus beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.

Bangladeshis hope election will end years of instability
Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story.
But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups, including Islamist hardliners, have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024.
It has also exposed the limitations of Yunus’ interim government, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China.
The government has declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi and has urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition.
Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster.
The rights group also condemned the attacks on the media as an assault on free expression.
Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups say continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election.
Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists.
Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation.
The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster.
Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.</p><small>2025-12-20 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20123754d5e7d8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962242/finance-ministry-says-provincial-shares-under-nfc-released-fortnightly-no-outstanding-liabilities-exist-after-kp-cms-accusation-of-stalled-funds' target='_blank'><strong>Finance ministry says provincial shares under NFC released fortnightly, no outstanding liabilities exist after KP CM’s accusation of stalled funds</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Finance said on Saturday that the federal government released provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) on a fortnightly basis, adding that “no outstanding liabilities exist in this regard”.
The statement from the ministry came a day after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi accused the federal government of stalling development in the merged tribal districts by not disbursing funds under the NFC resource-distribution formula for the current fiscal year.
In the statement released on Saturday, the ministry reaffirmed the federal government’s “continued commitment to ensuring timely, transparent, and sustained financial transfers” to KP under the NFC Award and beyond.
It said that under the 7th NFC Award, KP’s share was determined at 14.62 per cent of the provincial share in the divisible pool.







“In recognition of the extraordinary burden borne by the province during the war on terror, an additional one per cent of the undivided divisible pool was allocated exclusively to KP,” it said.
It further added that although the 7th NFC Award was originally envisaged for a five-year period, the absence of consensus on subsequent NFC Awards (8th, 9th, and 10th) necessitated the continued implementation of the 7th NFC Award framework.
“Accordingly, KP continues to receive its due share, including the additional allocation for the war on terror,” the ministry said.
“The federal government releases provincial NFC shares on a fortnightly basis, and no outstanding liabilities exist in this regard,” it said.
It highlighted that Rs46.44 billion had been released to the KP government on December 17, “underscoring the federal government’s adherence to timely disbursement commitments”.
The ministry also noted that from July 2010 to November 2025, Rs5.867 trillion had been transferred to the province as its share of the divisible pool. During this period, Rs705bn had been provided to the province on account of the war on terror, “reflecting federal recognition of the province’s sacrifices and responsibilities”, it added.
It further said that the Centre had also ensured the uninterrupted flow of straight transfers to KP.
“From July 2010 to November 2025, an amount of Rs482.78bn has been transferred on account of royalties on oil and natural gas, gas development surcharge, excise duty on natural gas, and other related heads,” the ministry said.
It noted that in recognition of the province’s “unique fiscal and administrative challenges”, the Centre had also extended “substantial financial support beyond the NFC framework”.
It said that following the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), the Centre had been financing the expenditures of the newly merged districts from its own NFC share; it said Rs704bn had been transferred since 2019 in this regard.
Further, the ministry said that an additional Rs117bn had been provided to the province “over the years” to support internally displaced persons.
“Despite constitutional devolution, the federal government continues to invest in provincial welfare and development,” it asserted. The ministry said that Rs115bn had been allocated to KP over the past 15 years from the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for “projects of a provincial nature”.
“Through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), an amount of Rs. 481.433bn has been spent in KP from FY2016 to FY2025 on unconditional and conditional cash transfers, providing critical social protection to vulnerable households,” it said.
The ministry said that the Centre was committed to strengthening the NFC framework through inclusive consultation. It said that during the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC, held on Dec 4, it was decided to constitute a dedicated sub-group to make recommendations on the merger of former Fata and their share in the divisible pool.
“At the request of the government of KP, the first meeting of this sub-group is scheduled for December 23, 2025, with the finance minister, KP serving as the designated convener, demonstrating a collaborative and transparent approach toward resolving outstanding fiscal matters,” it said.
The Ministry of Finance reiterated that the Centre remained fully committed to “equitable resource distribution, fiscal federalism, and sustained support for KP, ensuring that provincial needs, particularly those arising from security challenges, displacement, and administrative integration, are addressed in a timely and responsible manner”.</p><small>2025-12-20 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640497-pti-slams-toshakhana-case-verdict-against-party-founder-spouse' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams Toshakhana case verdict against party founder, spouse</strong></a><br><p>

Chasing a world record 435 runs to win, England were reduced to 207 for six at stumps, still 228 runs short of victory and having played no small part in their predicament through batting misadventure.
Jamie Smith, on two, and Will Jacks, on 11, were left to try to salvage something from the wreckage of another demolition day for the tourists.
With holders Australia 2-0 up in the five-test series after eight-wicket wins in Perth and Brisbane, they need only draw the match to retain the urn.

But there is little prospect of a rousing comeback win from an England squad that have failed to live up to expectations.
“Obviously very disappointing. Uphill battle from here,” England opener Zak Crawley told reporters.
“We came here to win the Ashes and we’re staring down the barrel now …. It’s been tough, they’re a very, very good side…. Obviously we’ve been slightly short of our best but credit to them.”
Questions have been asked of England’s preparations, selections and batting approach, and there were plenty more teachable moments from Saturday’s play at Adelaide Oval.
Their batters seemed determined to squander the rare periods when they could reasonably be judged to be on top of the Australian attack.
They needed at least one, and preferably two, to stand up like Travis Head who put on 170, nearly half Australia’s second-innings total of 349, to effectively bat England out of the game.
Instead, they were prey for Australia skipper Cummins, who took three top-order wickets andextracted gold from a still-firm pitch that proved unyielding, initially, for others.
In his first test since July, coming off a back injury, Cummins became the second test captain to take 150 wickets, joining Pakistan’s Imran Khan (187).
Keeping the champagne on ice
England’s Ben Duckett was first to go, taking a half-hearted push at a nagging ball and sending an edge flying chest-high to Marnus Labuschagne in the slips.
The shot was neither Bazball aggression nor stout defence, something meekly in between.
Number three Ollie Pope fell for 17 in a similar vein, nicking off to the slips with a more hard-handed prod and watching in disbelief as Labuschagne dived forward to take a one-hander just above the grass.
Labuschagne raced around the wicket in open-mouthed celebration, and England were 31 for two.
Another collapse beckoned but Crawley (85) and Joe Root (39) dug in until just after tea.
Root was lucky not to be dismissed lbw when he failed to play a shot at the part-time spin of Head, only to be caught-behind off Cummins moments later, playing at a ball he should have left.
It was Cummins’ 13th dismissal of England’s master batter, the most by any bowler.
Root slapped his bat in frustration but his was a misdemeanour compared to the batting crime committed by Harry Brook, who was bowled for 30 by Nathan Lyon with a botched reverse sweep.
Lyon followed up by bowling captain Ben Stokes for five with a ball that pitched, straightened and crashed into middle and off-stump.
The collapse gathered pace as Crawley lumbered forward at Lyon, misjudged the flight and was gleefully stumped by the clinical Alex Carey.
He had batted well for his 85 to that point but his wicket came as the pressure rose, leaving England needing a miracle from Jacks and Smith. Each has struggled for runs when their team has been crying out for them.
Australia will keep the champagne on ice until victory is complete.
“We want to keep working hard and probably not look too far ahead,” said Carey, who singled out Lyon for praise.
“I just thought Nathan was bowling really well and kept putting lots of energy on the ball. He toiled away all day and finally got some reward.”</p><small>2025-12-20 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640480-toshakhana-ii-case-explained-a-complete-timeline-and-key-facts' target='_blank'><strong>Toshakhana-2 case explained: A complete timeline and key facts</strong></a><br><p>

The lender said the funds will be released under the bank’s Public Resources for Inclusive Development — Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), which could provide up to $1.35 billion in total financing.
Of this amount, $600m will go for federal programmes and $100m will support a provincial programme in Sindh.
The approval follows a $47.9m World Bank grant in August to improve primary education in Punjab.
A separate statement issued by the lender quoted Bolormaa Amgaabazar, the World Bank’s country director for Pakistan, as saying, “Pakistan’s path to inclusive, sustainable growth requires mobilising more domestic resources and ensuring they are used efficiently and transparently to deliver results for people.”
She said that through the MPA, the bank was working with the federal and Sindh governments to “deliver tangible impacts—more predictable funding for schools and clinics, fairer tax systems, and stronger data for decision-making— while safeguarding priority social and climate investments and strengthening public trust”.
Tobias Akhtar Haque, World Bank lead country economist for Pakistan, said stregthening Pakistan’s fiscal foundations was “essential to restoring macroeconomic stability, delivering results and strengthening institutions”.
“Through the PRID-MPA, we are launching a coherent nationwide approach to support reforms that expand fiscal space, bolster investments in human capital and climate resilience, and strengthen revenue administration, budget execution, and statistical systems,” he said.
“These reforms will ensure that resources reach the front line and deliver better outcomes for people across Pakistan with greater efficiency and accountability,” he added.
According to the statement, the federal component will focus on raising domestic revenues more fairly, improving budget planning and execution, and strengthening data systems for evidence-based decisions.
Key actions include advancing tax policy and administration reforms; financing and scaling the Integrated Financial Management Information System and its linked e-procurement platform; undertaking targeted subsidy reforms; and strengthening the national statistical system led by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
In Sindh, the programme is expected to increase provincial revenues, enhance the speed and transparency of payments, and broaden the use of data to guide provincial decision-making, it said.
The programme will directly support the increase of public resources for inclusive development, including more equitable and responsive financing for primary healthcare facilities and more funding for schools, it added.
In November, an IMF-World Bank report, uploaded by the finance ministry, said the country’s fragmented regulation, opaque budgeting and political capture are curbing investment and weakening revenue.</p><small>2025-12-20 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640467-imran-khan-bushra-bibi-sentenced-to-17-years-in-toshakhana-ii-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi handed 17-year imprisonment, fined over Rs16m in Toshakhana-2 case</strong></a><br><p>

A US-led coalition had already been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces.







US President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed US personnel last weekend in Syria.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites” and said the operation was “OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE”.
“This is not the beginning of a war it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,” he added.







Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the US was inflicting “very serious retaliation”.







At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a “massive” blow against the ISIS members that the US blames for the Dec 13 attack on coalition forces.
“We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. It was very successful,” Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
US Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation.
One US official said the strikes were carried out by US F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems.
Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has “no safe havens on Syrian territory,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
Two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military.
Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack.
About 1,000 US troops remain in Syria.
The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with Islamic State.
Syria’s government is now led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria’s former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State.
Syria has been cooperating with a US-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.</p><small>2025-12-20 05:24</small></div><hr>
