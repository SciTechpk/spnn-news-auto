With a who’s who of powerful American business leaders in tow, including Tesla CEO and Trump adviser Elon Musk, he will first visit Riyadh, site of a Saudi-US Investment Forum, and go to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday but is not visiting Israel.
“While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over,” Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih said as he opened the forum.
“As a result … when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those join ventures happen,” he said before Trump’s arrival.
The Saudi-US investment forum began with a video showing soaring eagles and falcons, celebrating the long history between the United States and the kingdom.
At the front of a palatial hall sat Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of Blackstone, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan and Khalid.
Speaking at a forum panel as Trump touched down in Riyadh, Fink said he had visited Saudi Arabia more than 65 times over 20 years. He said the kingdom had been a follower when he first started visiting but was now “taking control” and broadening its economy out of its oil base.

Saudi Arabia and the US have maintained strong ties for decades based on an ironclad arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security.
Saudi F-15 fighter jets appeared on both sides of Air Force One, cruising along in close proximity to accompany Trump into the kingdom, according to a pool report from a Wall Street Journal reporter.
Trump has also said he may travel on Thursday to Turkey for potential face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Trump’s second foreign trip since returning to the presidency — his first was to Rome for Pope Francis’ funeral — comes at a time of geopolitical tension.
In addition to pressing for a settlement in Ukraine, his administration is pushing for a new aid mechanism for Gaza after 19 months of war and urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a new ceasefire deal there.
Over the weekend, US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails.
Apart from the possible Turkey side trip, those matters are not the focus of Trump’s Middle East swing as now scheduled.
The United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE are expected to announce investments that could run into the trillions. Saudi Arabia already committed in January to $600 billion in investments in the United States over the next four years, but Trump has said he will ask for a full trillion.
Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are travelling with the president.
Trump is expected to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth more than $100bn, sources told Reuters. This could include a range of advanced weapons including C-130 transport aircraft.
The US and Saudi Arabia are expected to avoid the topic of normalisation between Riyadh and Israel altogether, sources told Reuters, even as it is Trump’s most enduring geopolitical goal in the region.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term by which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco recognised Israel.
But opposition by Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, sources told Reuters.
Trump’s second and third stops, in Qatar and the UAE, are similarly expected to focus on economic issues.
Qatar’s royal family is expected to gift Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane to be outfitted for use as Air Force One, an arrangement that has drawn scrutiny from ethics experts.
Trump is expected to donate the plane to his presidential library for use after his term ends.</p><small>2025-05-13 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13112144a5d39de.jpg?r=112254' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733/11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan-in-indian-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India’s “unprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks” during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military’s media wing in a statement on Tuesday.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.
The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.
“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.
“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”
Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”
PM Shehbaz Sharif has announced that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p><small>2025-05-13 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/13123634b6b5dbb.jpg?r=124929' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910744/five-students-among-6-injured-in-battagram-school-van-firing' target='_blank'><strong>Five students among 6 injured in Battagram school van firing</strong></a><br><p>An assailant opened fire at a school van injuring six people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Battagram district, police said on Tuesday.
Battagram police spokesperson Gul Nabi told Dawn.com that the school van was coming from the Pirwahari area when it was attacked. “Five students and the van driver were injured in the incident,” he added.
The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Battagram, he continued, adding that one person, who was in critical condition, was referred to the Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad.
“A first information report [FIR] was lodged and efforts to arrest the suspect were underway,” Nabi added.
According to Kuzabanda Station House Officer (SHO) Amjid Khan, the suspect’s motive behind the incident was “personal vendetta” against the van driver. “The shooter opened fire, recklessly endangering the lives of the children onboard,” he said.
The president of the Private Education Network (PEN) Battagram chapter, Syed Raqib Shah, condemned the incident and characterised it as an “act of terrorism”.
Shah urged the Battagram district police officer (DPO) to register a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act and apprehend the assailant, warning that failure to do so would prompt a strong reaction from the community.
Last month, a senior civil judge and a lawyer were killed by unknown motorcyclists in Nowshera district. According to Nowshera DPO Abdur Rasheed, the incident was said to be one of personal enmity.</p><small>2025-05-13 07:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604297-supreme-court-adjourns-zahir-jaffer-appeal-hearing-till-may-19' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court adjourns Zahir Jaffer appeal hearing till May 19</strong></a><br><p>

The PSL was first moved to the UAE and subsequently postponed after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.
In a post on X today, Naqvi stated that the league will pick up from where it left. “Let the aura take over as we unite and celebrate the spirit of cricket,” he wrote.
 






Earlier, it was reported that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.
“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told Dawn on Monday.
“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.
With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.
However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — suspended due to the escalating hostilities.
While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p><small>2025-05-13 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604292-comment-pakistans-military-strategy-gets-global-validation' target='_blank'><strong>Comment: Pakistan's military strategy gets global validation</strong></a><br><p>

According to police, outlaws Almas and Fayyaz and some others had a land dispute with landlord Jeevan Bosan in Mad Sonhare Shah area. The landlord had stopped gang members from crossing his farm which led to an exchange of harsh words. One of the gang members shot at and injured Jeevan’s son Tayyab last week.
Police registered a case and raided their residences. Since the suspects had left their houses, police detained some females. Police also barred suspects’ relatives from harvesting their wheat.
The suspects were already declared proclaimed offenders in a kidnap for ransom case of Chaudhry Zafar, who belonged to Sahiwal.  Zafar was also a landlord in the riverine area and was kidnapped six weeks ago. He reportedly earned freedom after paying Rs 10 million ransom. He was kidnapped allegedly by Zafar Jhabeel who was also a proclaimed offender in some murder cases and a close friend of the Bosan Gang.

Another landlord ‘pays ransom’ for release

Police said the suspects and their family members were busy harvesting wheat when Jeevan along with a police team approached the scene. The suspects opened fire at Jeevan who died on the spot.
Rajanpur District Police Officer Farooq Amjad reached the scene and launched an operation against Bosan Gang.
In a joint operation, the Crime Control Department (CCD) and the police demolished the hideouts of the gang who fled on a boat.
On Monday, the police found the boat dotted with blood stains.  DPO Amjad told Dawn that they were chasing the gang and would arrest them soon.  “The gangsters exchanged gunfire with police last night and fled away in the darkness while blood stains were found on the boat recovered during the operation,” he said.
Quoting a family source of the gang members, he said that one of the members, Almas Bosan, was killed while three others were injured. “We are checking hospitals and other places to arrest other gang members”.
He also confirmed that the gang members had first shot at and injured the son of landlord Jeevan and were annoyed over the registration of a case against them.
He said that they were hurling threats of dire consequences at the landlord to take back the case and shot them for not doing so.
He said that the Bosan Gang members were facilitating Zafar Jhabeeal to carry out kidnap for ransom in the region. “We also offered them to surrender but they opened fire at police and they (police) had to retaliate,” he said
Answering a query about release of the kidnapped person, the DPO said that the landlord was released without paying any ransom as police had released their accomplice.

• Defence counsel claims there’s no concrete evidence against his clients; alleges they faced maltreatment during interrogation
KARACHI: A decade after the Safoora Goth bus attack that killed 47 members of the Shia Ismaili community, the counterterrorism official who arrested the terrorist gang expresses concern over the inordinate delay in executing their sentence, warning that failure to deliver justice to the victims’ families could embolden similar militant groups.
Meanwhile, the lawyer for the five convicts sentenced to death by a military court in 2016 says he has been representing his clients before the high court, arguing that they were not given a fair trial.
On May 13, 2015, a group of armed militants had stormed into a bus ferrying members of the Shia Ismaili community near Safoora Goth, opened indiscriminate fire, killing 47, including 18 women, and wounding six others.
A few days later, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) team, headed by Raja Umer Khattab, had arrested five militants — Tahir alias Minhas alias Sain, Saad Aziz alias Tin Tin, Hafiz Nasir Ahmed, Mohammad Azhar Ishrat and Asad Rehman. They were said to be inspired by the militant Islamic State (IS) group, and involved in multiple incidents of targeted killings.
In 2016, a military court had sentenced them to death in the Safoora bus carnage case. However, 10 years after the attack, the case against the militants has yet to reach a logical conclusion due to their appeals pending hearing before the high court.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Khattab has expressed concern that the failure to deliver justice could embolden other likeminded militant groups, warning that it could lead to a serious crisis.
He questioned why, even after a decade, the sentences had not been implemented.
Mr Khattab fears that the delay in executing their sentence could enable their accomplices in other militant groups to plan their release by orchestrating a hostage crisis.
He is convinced that these militants would pose a grave threat to society, witnesses, those who imprisoned them and their families if they secure their release. He believes that executing their sentences would have neutralised this threat.
Recalls success in dismantling militant group
Recalling how he succeeded in tracing the militant group, Mr Khattab said that he had visited the crime scene, where he came across a crucial lead during the search — a lead he had long been seeking, which eventually led him to the militant group’s leader, Tahir Sain.
“I was inside the bus, and due to the blood spilled all over, I slipped and that’s when my hand landed on the very lead I had been searching for over a long period,” Mr Khattab recalled, adding that it was through this lead that he became certain about the involvement of a specific group in this incident.
The CTD official revealed that before the incident, terrorist groups had been under surveillance for years, during which several militants were arrested and valuable information was obtained from them.
He stated that the gathered intelligence indicated that a local wing of Al Qaeda was operating in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, where young men were engaged in translation work for propaganda purposes and were also involved in the preparation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
When asked how they discovered that the local IS group was involved in several terrorist activities in Karachi, Mr Khattab said they had been monitoring a suspect in the Banaras area but failed to apprehend him as he managed to flee.
However, while searching his house, they removed a wall frame and found a taped-over hole in the wall. As they removed the tape, a USB drive was there which contained a video, revealing that the local Al Qaeda militants were planning to declare themselves as the local chapter of IS.
He emphasised that after the disappearance of the suspected militant, IED attacks in Karachi stopped for some time. However, a few months later, members of the Bohra community were targeted in the Dhoraji area where, for the first time, a pamphlet bearing the name of Daesh, the Arabic acronym of IS, was found at the crime scene.
He recalled that a series of terrorist activities began, including targeted attacks on law enforcement agencies, a private school, American educationist Debra Lobo, rights activist Sabeen Mahmud, and finally the Safoora Goth bus carnage.
Mr Khattab disclosed that during the planning of the Safoora Goth massacre, internal disagreements emerged among the militants, with some suggesting that the victims be set on fire after being killed. However, since it was to be the first attack on the Ismaili community, that part of the plan was eventually put on hold, he added.
He claimed the group was planning to attack some fashion designers in the metropolis but failed as they were caught by the CTD.
My clients denied fair trial: defence counsel Senior lawyer Hashmat Habib has been representing the five convicts after a military court sentenced them to death in 2016.
He filed five identical applications, which are still pending before the Sindh High Court.
In the applications, Advocate Habib submitted that there was no concrete evidence against his clients, who allegedly faced maltreatment during interrogation.
He also stated that the accused were denied a fair trial and were not allowed to engage a defence counsel of their choice at the time of the trial by a military court.

Chairing a high-level meeting at the CM House, Mr Shah said that several development schemes focusing on water supply, drainage, solar energy, and both industrial and agricultural development would be included in the ADP.
In the last year’s ADP, no new schemes had been included and the CM in his budget speech had said that the focus would be on the completion of the projects that had been ongoing for the past 10 years.
The CM also emphasised that reconstruction of the schools damaged by floods would be a top priority in the forthcoming uplift plan.
He directed the P&D department to carefully plan completion of all ongoing schemes first.
Highlighting the scale of this year’s development programme, the CM recalled that the ADP was worth Rs493 billion, with Rs55 billion specifically allocated under the district ADP.
Mr Shah added that there were 4,644 development schemes in progress during the current fiscal year, and it was expected that 1,812 of them would be completed by the end of June 2025.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to formally announce the scheme to revive the housing and construction sector, which is passing through challenging times along with purportedly 72 associated industries, an informed source told Dawn.
The sources said the government would initially provide about 200,000 low-cost 3-5 marla housing units after their construction in the public sector at 50pc subsidy on financing and then expand it. A draft plan was shared with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and commercial banks on Monday.
A meeting on affordable housing finance schemes was presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Monday to address the critical challenges faced in long-term housing finance and explore viable policy models for low-cost housing in Pakistan. The meeting was also attended by SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed, chief executive officers of private and public sector banks and Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC) representatives.
The SBP chief and commercial bank CEOs sought a week for their feedback. At this stage, the government considered two options. First, provision of 50pc subsidised funding to select people and offer them to construct 3-5 marla houses independently. Second, the government could build such housing units in the public sector and hand them over to people on 50pc subsidised financing. The stakeholders would meet again next week.
The meeting noted that Pakistan currently faces a severe housing shortage and a “paradoxical situation” for affordable housing. The current shortage was estimated at 12 million units, while additional annual demand was around 700,000. In contrast, the annual supply stood at just 250,000. This meant an annual gap of about 450,000 units. This included about 65pc (about 292,500) shortfall in the lower income group, followed by 25pc or 112,500 per annum in the lower middle-income group and the remaining 10pc or 45,000 in the upper middle-income groups.
It was considered paradoxical because there were challenges of affordability, limited access to finance, lack of mortgage financing and 64pc youth below the age of 30 on the demand side. On the other hand, the cost of land and material was too high, there were high risk and low profit margins, regulatory barriers, and high interest and tax rates on the supply side.
The participants reviewed international best practices and mortgage models from countries including Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, Bangladesh, Brazil, and India. They discussed designing a practical and sustainable housing finance framework tailored to Pakistan’s socio-economic landscape.
The minister said that the unavailability of long-term housing finance remained one of the country’s most significant barriers to affordable housing. He recalled substantial progress made in 2017-18, which was unfortunately disrupted by political instability. “When policy continuity is lacking, the public bears the cost,” he noted.
Referring to the success of auto-leasing models in the private sector, the minister questioned why a similar model could not be implemented for housing. “Millions of people live their entire lives in rented homes. Owning a house should not be a distant dream for the salaried class,” he said, adding that “a two to three crore home cannot be built through lump-sum payments by an average income earner.”
Ahsan Iqbal advocated for a housing finance framework similar to auto-leasing, backed by mortgages and supported by government policy.

ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Monday unanimously adopted a resolution commending the armed forces for giving a befitting response to the Indian aggression last week before US President Trump announced that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries.
The resolution in the National Assembly, moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the long-term stability in South Asia can only be achieved through “sincere and structured negotiations”.
Reiterating Pakistan’s pledge to regional and global peace with dignity and honour, the resolution underscored that “democracies are committed to dialogue not conflict”. It urged the authorities to actively engage the international community to resolve the issue of Indian occupied Kashmir dispute in accordance with the aspirations of locals and the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions.
Stressing the importance of the Indus Waters Treaty, the House resolved to continue to play its constitutional role in safeguarding national interest and promoting peace, unity and security for the people of Pakistan and the region.
The resolution expressed gratitude to Almighty Allah “for granting the Pakistani nation dignity and honour in defending the motherland’s territorial integrity against the unjustified and naked Indian aggression”.
It congratulated the nation, which “rose above all differences and stood united behind its leadership across the political spectrum with one voice”.
The House commended the armed forces for their “exemplary professionalism, vigilance and courage” in defending the sovereignty of Pakistan.
The House resolution also paid tribute to the martyrs who “laid down their lives in defence of the motherland” and acknowledged their “supreme sacrifice” as a symbol of national pride, resilience and unity.
It expressed sincere gratitude to the friendly countries for their support to Pakistan at this critical juncture.
Phase-wise privatisation
Earlier, the assembly was informed that the federal government has approved the privatisation of 24 state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Parliamentary Secretary Aasia Ishaque Siddiqui briefed the members on privatisation during the question hour.
She said the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), First Women Bank and several power and financial institutions were set to be privatised in the first phase.
She said the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation, in its meeting on August 2, 2024, approved a plan for phase-wise privatisation of 24 public sector organisations.
The process will be conducted in three phases over the next five years, Ms Siddiqui said, adding the first phase will be completed within a year, the second within one to three years and the third in three to five years.
In the first phase, the privatisation of PIA, First Women Bank, House Building Finance Corporation, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, Pakistan Engineering Company, Islamabad Electric Supply Company, Gujranwala Electric Power Company, Faisalabad Electric Supply Company and Sindh Engineering Limited will take place.
In the second phase, State Life Insurance Corporation, Pakistan Reinsurance Company, Central Power Generation Company, Jamshoro Power Company, Northern Power Generation Company, and Lakhra Power Generation Company will be privatised. Lahore, Multan, Hazara, Hyderabad, Peshawar and Sukkur electric supply companies will also be privatised in this phase.
In the third phase, Postal Life Insurance Company will be transferred to the private sector.
The House was also told that the latest Household Income Expenditure Survey has been completed to facilitate better planning for poverty alleviation across the country.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics was currently compiling the survey data.
He said the new estimates will be available by the end of this year, with the final report likely to be published next year.
He pointed out that the current relief measures were based on data from 2018-2019.Legislation
The National Assembly also passed the Special Technology Zones Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and the National Commission for Minority Rights Bill, 2025.

Autonomous and artificial intelligence-assisted weapons systems are already playing a greater role in conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza. And rising defence spending worldwide promises to provide a further boost for burgeoning AI-assisted military technology.
Progress towards establishing global rules governing their development and use, however, has not kept pace. And internationally binding standards remain virtually non-existent.
Since 2014, countries that are part of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) have been meeting in Geneva to discuss a potential ban fully autonomous systems that operate without meaningful human control and regulate others.

Autonomous and AI-assisted weapons systems are playing a bigger role in conflicts

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set a 2026 deadline for states to establish clear rules on AI weapon use. But human rights groups warn that consensus among governments is lacking.
Alexander Kmentt, head of arms control at Austria’s foreign ministry, said that must quickly change.
“Time is really running out to put in some guardrails so that the nightmare scenarios that some of the most noted experts are warning of don’t come to pass,” he said.
 
 

Monday’s gathering of the UN General Assembly in New York will be the body’s first meeting de­­dicated to autonomous weapons.
Though not legally binding, diplomatic officials want the consultations to ramp up pressure on military powers that are resisting regulation due to concerns the rules could dull the technology’s battlefield advantages.
Campaign groups hope the meeting, which will also address critical issues not covered by the CCW, including ethical and human rights concerns and the use of autonomous weapons by non-state actors, will push states to agree on a legal instrument.
They view it as a crucial litmus test on whether countries are able to bridge divisions ahead of the next round of CCW talks in September.
“This issue needs clarification through a legally binding treaty. The technology is moving so fast,” said Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Military, Security and Policing.
“The idea that you wouldn’t want to rule out the delegation of life or death decisions … to a machine seems extraordinary.”
Arms race
The New York talks come after 164 states supported a 2023 UN General Assembly resolution calling for the international community to urgently address the risks posed by autonomous weapons.
While many countries back a binding global framework, the United States, Russia, China and India prefer national guidelines or existing international laws, according to Amnesty.
“We have not been convinced that existing law is insufficient,” a US Pentagon spokesperson said, adding that autonomous weapons might actually pose less risk to ci­­v­­­ilians than conventional weapons.
The governments of India, Russia, and China did not respond to requests for comment.
In the absence of regulation, autonomous systems are proliferating.
Weapons experts at the Future of Life Institute think tank have tracked the deployment of roughly 200 autonomous weapon systems across Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.
Russian forces, for example, have deployed some 3,000 Veter kamikaze drones — capable of autonomously detecting and engaging targets — to Ukraine, according to its data.
Ukraine has, meanwhile, used semi-autonomous drones in the conflict. The Ukrainian government declined to comment.
Israel has used AI-systems to identify targets in Gaza. Its mission in Geneva said it supported multilateral discussions and uses data technologies in full accordance with international law.
Human Rights Watch, however, said crucial questions of accountability under international law remain unresolved and warned in a report last month that unregulated autonomous weapons present a range of threats to human rights and could provoke an arms race if unchecked.
And campaigners like Laura Nolan of Stop Killer Robots worry there is currently little to ensure defence firms will develop AI-driven weapons responsibly.
“We do not generally trust industries to self-regulate … There is no reason why defence or technology companies should be more worthy of trust,” she said.

His colleagues from various pro-Modi TV channels were reporting about a “regime change” in Pak­istan when not mentioning the firing of Russian-made Bra­hmos missiles into densely populated parts of Karachi.
Their audiences were beg­inning to doubt the rav­ings but had nowhere to verify the facts. Prac­tically every foreign channel or newspaper was made inaccessible in India by overt or covert means.
“Who authorised Presi­dent Trump to interv­ene?” Goswami was frothing at the mouth.
In his dream world, there couldn’t be Pakis­tani pilots outfoxing their Ind­ian counterparts, or Pakis­tan having better planes.
The political leadership has usually been defended by its TV channels. That nexus could be coming to a head.
The brunt of the attack, however, was borne not by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who would have been the obvious interlocutor with President Trump.
Mr Modi’s loyalists turned their ire on Foreign Secre­tary Vikram Misri, the man who had been carrying out the arduous task of briefing the nation on the post-Pahalgam tensions and the eventual shootouts with Pakistan.
 
 

As per reports, the official was subjected to vicious trolling for announcing on the government’s behalf the cessation of military operations.
In the face of trolls, Mr Misri’s colleagues rose in support of the beleaguered diplomat.
A post on the X account of Indian Administrative Service Association expressed solidarity with Mr Misri and his family.
“Unwarranted personal attacks on civil servants performing their duties with integrity are deeply regrettable. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the dignity of public service,” the association of India’s bureaucrats said.
The Indian Police Service (IPS) Association also condemned the personal attacks on Mr Misri.
“Unequivocally condemn the deplorable personal attacks against Foreign Secretary Misri and his family. Such unwarranted assaults on civil servants committed to their duties are intolerable,” said the representative body of police officers.
After Mr Misri’s personal account on X was subjected to vulgar comments, most targeting his daughter, he locked his public account, according to The Hindu.
Asaduddin Owaisi, the member of parliament from Hyderabad, put the issue in context.
“Our civil servants work under the Executive. This must be remembered & they shouldn’t be blamed for the decisions taken by The Executive /or any Political leadership running Watan E Aziz (the beloved nation),” he wrote on X.
Congress leader Sachin Pilot also condemned the abuse directed at Mr Misri’s family.
“It’s unacceptable to target our professional diplomats and civil servants — those who work dedicatedly to serve the nation,” Mr Pilot said on X.
Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, also supported Mr Misri.
“Mr Misri did his duty impeccably. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to feel malice towards him. He has only conveyed the message that the political leadership of India has taken.”
As the story shifted to self-recrimination, greater trouble loomed for India.
President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are striking fresh trade deals.
A US-China rapprochement against the backdrop of the India-Pakistan flare-up can’t be good news for New Delhi.
Away from the political volatility in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was urging his people to return to their homes near the Line of Control that has gone silent as seldom before.

Had the South Asian neighbours been more agreeably engaged than pursuing a destructive campaign against each other, the thought is too enticing to ignore that Indian and Pakistani troops would perhaps be marching in lockstep with Chinese, Russian, Uzbek, Egyptian and other comrades to pursue a new world order for equitable peace and sustainable prosperity. There are powerful antibodies stalking the possibility, however.
Mercifully, the fires have been doused in South Asia at least for now even though they were doused by the world’s most incendiary nation that ever wielded the firehose. For all their macho victory cries over claims of damage they inflicted on each other amid a display of grief and valour, India and Pakistan found themselves leaning on foreign shoulders yet again to resolve an essentially bilateral issue, illustrating not for the first time that they have not quite attained adulthood to shepherd the destiny of over a billion souls. The brokered peace, nevertheless, links the tragedy in Pahalgam with a world of power politics.
Be sanguine that the pointless flare-up wasn’t triggered by some four mysterious hate-mongers who showed up to kill innocent men in Pahalgam only to disappear without trace (as yet) in one of the world’s most militarised and policed places. That the foursome called out their victims’ religion turned into a tool to profit from with the time-tested game of identity politics. Remember that in the 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat, after a train fire tragedy in Godhra, it was Pakistan that was first named as the accused; only later mobs were unleashed on unsuspecting Muslims.
Religious politics in South Asia of the Hindu-Muslim variety was nurtured into deep fault lines by colonialism as a protection against another 1857 uprising. ‘Divide et impera’ they called it. Saadat Hasan Manto captured religious frenzy in several short stories that accompanied the violent creation of India and Pakistan. ‘Mistake’ was a story about the murder of a wrong man, the error discovered when his dead body was stripped and revealed he belonged to the killer’s community. The popular Indian leader who plies identity politics to fetch electoral windfalls was not around at the time. But he has spoken of a simpler way whereby one could identify Muslims by their attire. (And thereby also figure out the non-Muslims.) The monsters of Pahalgam missed the trick or perhaps needed an audio track for their crime.

Moscow and Beijing have found growing numbers of applicants from across the world keen to join the coalition against Western hegemony.

Step back from Pahalgam, and you might find a clearer action-reaction pattern. Pahalgam spawned a third military stand-off to involve a BRICS member. It couldn’t be a coincidence that Iran and Russia, key pillars of the coming multipolar world, are in the crosshairs of the West. Unlike the military crisis facing Iran, which has risen as a powerful symbol for the Global South, or Russia, a founding leader of BRICS, which sees itself as a pivot to a multipolar future and therefore is sought to be ‘weakened’ by the West through a grinding proxy war, the South Asian conflict disrupts BRICS more diabolically. India, a founder member of BRICS, balks at the idea of its South Asian rival joining the immensely powerful group. India is a leading member of BRICS but is increasingly perceived as its weak link. Pakistan, on the other hand, being an ardent supporter of BRICS, can become a full member only if India doesn’t obstruct the path. The Pahalgam terror attack of April 22 therefore can be explored as a trigger to sow seeds of discord in the ranks of the Global South and thereby of BRICS.
The mesmeric Victory Day celebrations at Moscow’s Red Square marked a crucial moment for BRICS, the group that terrifies Donald Trump and which Russia and China are feverishly pressing on with. Moscow and Beijing have found unexpectedly large and growing numbers of applicants from across the world keen to join the coalition against Western hegemony controlling their political and economic lives. In attendance at the Red Square to cheer the spectacular pageantry were heavyweights from the rising Global South. Xi Jinping, of course, but not to be ignored were his comrades from Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, Egypt, Belarus, practically the entire Central Asian lot, but also notably, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam from the Southeast Asian flank. The heads of Serbia and Slovakia, which is a Nato member, broke ranks with their Western minders to attend.
African leaders rejoiced and cheered on as Vladimir Putin put on a memorable display of music and colour that gave a new cadence to the great coming together. Stanley Kubrick’s awe-inspiring military columns in the cinematic version of Howard Fast’s Spartacus come to mind. The movie was scripted by the former head of the US communist party as an ode to the uprising of slaves against the mighty Roman Empire. The similarity with Friday’s turnout was that these soldiers, too, were celebrating the defeat of a racist regime. Not to miss the smiling face of Vladimir Lenin printed on red flags in the march past. After a long time, the communist emblem of hammer and sickle shone through the marching columns.
Missing, not unpredictably, from the celebrations was Narendra Modi. He had made up his mind to forgo the event months before the shooting war with Pakistan would happen. With the rise of Donald Trump, India has been perceived as tardy in cementing BRICS as a challenge to the West. For this alone, Modi was the winner last week, even if Pakistan claims to have fought a better war.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report cited a significant deterioration since October. It forecast that 2.1 million people across Gaza — roughly the entire population — will likely experience high levels of acute food insecurity, with 469,500 projected at  “catastrophic” levels — the most severe stage. The previous IPC analysis in October found 133,000 people in that category.
Israel sealed off Gaza in early March when it resumed military action against Hamas after a ceasefire collapsed.
Israeli  government spokesperson David Mencer said the IPC had  “constantly talked about famine; famine has never happened because of  Israel’s efforts to get more aid in.” He blamed Hamas for causing hunger by allegedly stealing aid. Hamas denies this, accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon.

Warns half a million people face starvation

The IPC report stated that Israeli military plans and aid agencies’  “persistent inability” to deliver essential goods mean a “high risk” of famine during the May 11 to Sept 30 projection period.
“Immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, starvation and acute malnutrition, and a descent into famine,” the report urged. Famine declaration requires at least  20 per cent of people facing extreme food shortages, high child malnutrition,  and elevated death rates from starvation or related diseases.
The report projected that nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition, including 14,100 severe cases, among children, aged 6 to 59 months, were expected to occur between April 2025 and March 2026.
The report “really demonstrates that the situation in Gaza has deteriorated quite dramatically in recent months,” said Beth Bechdol,  deputy director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. She noted  the blockade since early March “has really prevented the delivery of  essential humanitarian and even commercial supplies.”
While noting that the two-month-long ceasefire had allowed for a temporary alleviation of acute food shortages and ma­­lnutrition, the IPC report said the on­­g­oing blockade had reversed the situation. The key findings showed that 1.95 mill­i­­on people, or 93pc of the population in the coastal enclave, are living through high levels of acute food insecurity, including 244,000 experiencing the most severe, or  “catastrophic”, levels.

• AJK premier hails army’s response as president wants immediate relief for affected families
MUZAFFARABAD: Indian troops violated the ceasefire agreement late Sunday night by resorting to ‘unprovoked’ shelling across the Line of Control (LoC), resulting in the death of a young man in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), officials said on Monday.
According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), Indian forces targeted several villages in the Nakyal sector of southern Kotli district shortly after 11pm, using both small and heavy arms during a 40-minute barrage.
In Bari Dhara Mathrani, one of the affected villages, 32-year-old Muhammad Shahid, son of Muhammad Taj, sustained critical abdominal injuries when shrapnel from a mortar shell struck him.
He was initially treated at the THQ Hospital in Nakyal and later referred to the DHQ Hospital in Kotli, where he succumbed to his wounds at around 1am.
 
 

A brief episode of shelling was also reported from the Haveli district, the SDMA chief added.
Shahid’s death raised the toll from the recent wave of cross-LoC shelling, including missile attacks in Muzaffarabad and Kotli districts, to 32. They included 12 in Kotli, six each in Bhimber and Poonch, three in Muzaffarabad, two each in Neelum and Haveli, and one in Bagh. Another 123 people were injured in the hostilities.
School, colleges reopen today
The AJK government annou­nced the reopening of all educational institutions from today (Tuesday), following a temporary closure amid the escalation.
However, a revised schedule for the postponed examination papers will be issued separately by the AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) in Mirpur, Mr Khan said.
Earlier on Monday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq visited forward posts in the Barnala sector of Bhimber district to express solidarity with the armed forces for their robust response to Indian aggression and to console families affected by the shelling.
Addressing the troops, Mr Haq lauded the army’s professionalism and high morale, stating that ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ had forced the Indian forces to back down.
“The Pakistan Army has made the country’s defence invincible,” he remarked, also praising the Pakistan Air Force for showcasing its capabilities with international recognition.
He condemned India’s targeting of civilian populations and infrastructure, and applauded the resilience and bravery of the AJK people.
He said compensation had been provided to the families of martyrs and injured persons within 24 hours, and that relevant departments remained fully alert and operational round-the-clock.
The prime minister pledged to personally visit all LoC-affected areas to assess damages and ensure timely relief and rehabilitation.
During his visit, Mr Haq met with the families of those martyred in Saturday’s shelling, offering condolences and handing over compensation cheques. As his convoy passed through the area, large crowds chanted slogans in support of Pakistan, the armed forces, and the AJK leadership.
President for immediate relief to affected families
Separately, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood strongly condemned India for deliberately targeting innocent and unarmed civilians along the LoC, calling it a blatant display of frustration.
Expressing heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wishing a swift recovery to the injured, he directed the government and relevant authorities to urgently assess the damages and ensure immediate relief for the affected population, including uninterrupted medical care for the wounded.

• Modi warns New Delhi will not tolerate ‘nuclear blackmail’

WASHINGTON: Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump has claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address to the nation asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail” in the event of further conflict with Islamabad.
Trump’s comments, made during a press interaction at the White House, signal a rare moment of US diplomatic mediation bet­ween the two South Asian nuclear powers and suggest a broader Ameri­can strategy that ties peace to economic engagement.
“We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed,” Trump said while talking to reporters.
This is perhaps one of the starkest warnings yet from the US leader, who has rarely minced words in highlighting global security threats. His remarks reflect Washing­ton’s growing concern about the fragile peace between India and Pakistan, both of whom possess significant nuclear arsenals and a long history of military confrontations.
In a tone that combined both reassurance and transactional diplomacy, Trump added that the United States is prepared to enhance trade with both countries — if they continue to engage in dialogue. “We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. We’re going to do a lot of trade with India. We’re negotiating with India right now. We’re going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan,” he said, linking the prospect of economic cooperation to continued regional stability.
 


Trump, who appeared eager to underscore his adm­inistration’s peacemaking role, said: “On Sat­u­rday, my administration helped broker an immediate ceasefire, I think a maybe permanent one bet­ween India and Pakistan — the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons.”
His assertion, while dramatic, underscores the high stakes involved in this latest confrontation and his belief that trade can be a powerful tool of diplomacy.
He also praised the leadership of both countries for their roles in defusing the situation. “I’m very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful, but unwavering in both cases — they really were from the standpoint of having the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity of the situation,” he said.
Trump also offered a unique insight into how he leveraged economic incentives to push both sides toward de-escalation.
 
 

“We helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said ‘Come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it, let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’re doing trade’,” he said. He then added: “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade. People have never really used trade the way I used it. By that, I can tell you, and all of a sudden they said. I think we’re gonna stop, and they have.”
In concluding his remarks, the president emphasised once again the magnitude of what he believed had been averted. “We stopped a nuclear conflict,” he declared, before offering thanks to members of his administration. “I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their work,” he said, crediting them for helping facilitate the peace process.
While the claims made by President Trump will be scrutinised in Washington and South Asia, they do indicate a willingness on the part of the US to reassert its role as a mediator in global conflicts. Whether these efforts translate into a lasting peace between India and Pak­i­stan, however, remains to be seen.
‘Nuclear blackmail’
Indian PM Modi vowed on Monday to respond strongly to any future “terrorist attack”, and cautioned that India would not succumb to ‘nuclear blackmail’ in the face of future provocations.
A weekend ceasefire which Trump said he brokered appeared to be holding on Monday after four days of intense jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours since 1999.
The conflict followed an April 22 attack on tourists in Pahalgam, in India-held Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.
Modi, in a televised address to the nation — his first since hostilities began last Wednesday — said Pakistan has chosen to attack rather than help it fight “terrorism”. “If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given.”
“India’s stand is very clear. Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together… Water and blood cannot flow together.”
Pakistan had strongly denied having any role in the attack on tourists in India-held Kashmir, and has repeatedly asked New Delhi for sharing any evidence.
Proclaiming victory in the short and bitter standoff in which foreign media reported the downing of several Indian warplanes, including the highly rated French-made Rafale jets, and Indian military claiming hitting what it called terrorist targets in Pakistan, Modi said it would be the new normal against terrorism.
India launched a missile barrage against Pakistan on May 7, but remained silent about the downing of its estimated five warplanes in response.
The Indian PM underplayed the role of foreign interlocutors in brokering the ceasefire. “And I am repeating again, we have just postponed our retaliatory action on Pakistan’s terrorist and military bases. In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the basis of what attitude it adopts.”
Three key issues
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that any future talks with India would focus on three key issues — Kashmir, terrorism and water.
In an exclusive talk with a private news channel, he said India’s arrogance is the main reason why these matters remain unresolved. Kashmir can be resolved under UN resolutions, but India’s stubbornness is the hurdle, he added.
The minister stated that terrorism has affected Pakistan for decades, and there is solid evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring terror activities inside the country. India had violated the Indus Water Treaty, he said, adding that an attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed.
Mr Asif emphasised the world has recognised Pakistan’s military readiness and its responsible approach in times of conflict.

• COAS calls conflict ‘defining chapter in the country’s military history’ as ISPR rejects reports of ceasefire breach
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani and Indian senior military officials on Monday agreed to uphold the ceasefire reached last week and reduce troop deployments along the international border, following days of hostilities between the two countries that had raised fears of a wider conflict.
The directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both countries held a scheduled conversation at 4:30pm that lasted about 45 minutes. The discussion was originally scheduled for noon, but was postponed till afternoon — the delay was attributed by some sources to a difference over the agenda of the meeting.
The two officers — Pakis­tan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdul­lah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai — discussed measures to reinforce their mutual co­mmitment not to fire or eng­age in any aggressive or in­imical actions, according to Indian authorities. There was no official statement r­eleased by the Pakistan Army regarding the meeting.
In addition to reaffirming the ceasefire, the two sides reportedly agreed to pursue immediate steps to reduce troop presence along the borders and forward areas, which is seen as a significant move amid fragile calm after a four-day flare-up from May 7 to May 10.
Pakistani officials described the conversation as the initial round of talks after the ceasefire took effect. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the DGMOs are expected to have another round of talks within 48 hours for further discussions.
In peacetime, Pakistan and India typically station border security forces — the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force, respectively — along the international border, while regular army troops remain in nearby cantonments for rapid deployment if needed. Under the existing terms of engagement, helicopters are restricted from flying within 1 kilometre of the border, and combat jets must remain at least 10 kilometres away.
During heightened tensions, both countries activate wartime formations, repositioning offensive and defensive units closer to the border. After escalation, defensive formations occupy positions on border, whereas offensive forces get into ‘concentration areas’ — usually behind the front lines, where units gather, assemble, and prepare before launching an attack or advancing, according to deployment contingencies. The same happened during this crisis. This understanding reached at the DGMOs interaction implies that some of the troops would move back to their peacetime locations. Pakistan’s defensive units are assigned specific sectors, while its offensive formations operate flexibly, without a pre-designated area of responsibility.
The latest contact between DGMOs comes after both countries agreed on May 10 to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a sharp escalation that included drone and missile attacks, artillery fire, and airbase strikes. The violence was triggered by India’s May 7 aggression against Pakistan on the pretext of April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian-Occupied Kashmir. Pakistani armed military responded with ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’.
Though the ceasefire was brokered through high-level US mediation, violations were reported just hours after the agreement took effect. Both sides blamed each other for the breaches and Monday’s meeting aimed to reinforce the fragile truce.
On Monday night, the army’s media wing responded to reports in the Indian media, saying that Pakistani forces were fully abiding by the ceasefire. It rejected Indian allegations regarding the violation of the ceasefire.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised speech, said India had “suspended retaliatory action” but warned that future conduct would be judged by Pakistan’s posture. “We will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,” he said.
In a detailed statement, Pakistan’s military described Operation Bunyan un Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of tri-services integration across land, air, sea, and cyber domains, delivering precision strikes against Indian military targets.
The operation employed long-range missiles, drones, and cyber warfare to hit 26 key installations in Indian-occupied Kashmir and mainland India, including air force bases, logistics hubs, command centres, and missile storage facilities, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in its statement. “Pakistan Armed Forces possess an ‘adequate’ suite of very sophisticated ‘niche military technologies’, and only a limited number and type were used with restraint in this conflict,” it maintained.
The ISPR emphasised that the operation was “precise, proportionate, and remarkably restrained,” targeting only those directly involved in attacks on Pakistani civilians.
“No hostile design can erode the determination of the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” army chief Gen Asim Munir said during a visit to injured personnel at CMH Rawalpindi.
“The resolute and unified response exhibited during Marka-i-Haq /Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, in concert with the steadfast support of the Pakistani people, constitutes a defining chapter in the country’s military history.”

Reacting to Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan’s speech, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Mr Raja said the demolition of institutions was continuing unabated. 
“No rules permit the speaker making speech as a member, while the deputy speaker is chairing the house proceedings,” he said.
He said the speaker had delivered a speech in the House, which was the prerogative of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. 
He said the speaker violated the rules of procedure of the assembly governing conduct of business because “Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is toeing his father’s policy of silence vis-a-vis India”.
He said the chief minister’s absence/silence over such an important event was not a simple negligible act. In fact, he said, this was a continuation of Nawaz Sharif’s silence policy on the episode. Its food for thought, he added.

The PAC meeting, headed by its Chairman Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, also directed the auditor general of Pakistan to provide technical staff to the director general of Sindh audit for verification of medicine procurement.
Attended among others by PAC Members Qasim Siraj Soomro, Taha Ahmed and Rehan Rajput, and Health Secretary Rehan Baloch, the meeting reviewed the audit reports of the health department for years 2018 and 2019.
Answering a question asked by a committee member, the health secretary said that tenders were given through the procurement committee for the purchase of medicines in the health department.
The provincial chief drug inspector informed the meeting that that drug inspectors checked medicines, including licences to pharmacies and stores, while the authority to seal medical stores laid with district health officers (DHOs).
The health secretary said that the approval to register FIRs against those who exported unregistered and fake medicines was given by the department’s quality control board, which was fully activated.
The PAC ordered the authorities concerned to check the sale of fake and unregistered medicines at the medical stores and cancel the licenses of those involved in the illegal and deadly practice.
The PAC also ordered the health department to inquire into the performance of the drug inspectors across Sindh.
The health department was also asked to provide audit records related to Rs6 billion expenditure in different heads across the province, within two months.

Trade talks with the United States — which had played a key role mediating a ceasefire between the two countries — would likely have progressed in “short order” and that Pakistan could import more high-quality cotton, more soy beans and was also exploring other asset classes, including hydrocarbons, Aurangzeb said in the online interview.
Regarding the conflict, Aurangzeb described it as a “short duration escalation” with minimal fiscal impact, stating it can be “accommodated within the fiscal space which is available to the government of Pakistan”.
When questioned about potential increased military spending in the upcoming budget, Aurangzeb deferred comment, saying it was premature to discuss specific plans. However, he said: “Whatever we need to do in terms of ensuring that our defence requirements are met will be met.”
Aurangzeb said he expects the Indus Water Treaty, which India unilaterally suspended, to be reinstated and rolled back to where it was.
He said there is not going to be any immediate impact from India’s suspension and Pakistan does not “even want to consider any scenario which does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty”.
Earlier today, President Donald Trump said the US was ready to help India and Pakistan after a ceasefire agreement, claiming trade was a big reason they “stopped fighting”.
Pakistan faces a 29 per cent tariff on exports to the US due to an approximate $3 billion trade surplus, but this is currently under a 90-day pause announced in April.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved a $1bn loan disbursement to Pakistan as part of a larger $7bn bailout agreement.
“Islamabad will receive the tranche disbursement on Tuesday,” Aurangzeb said.
The IMF executive board also approved a fresh $1.4bn loan to Pakistan under its climate resilience facility.
The federal budget for the next fiscal year, starting July, will be finalised within the next three to four weeks, with scheduled budget talks with the IMF to take place from May 14-23, he said.
Tensions between India and Pakistan began mounting after the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, sparking the worst clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours in more than two decades.
On Saturday, a ceasefire in the region was announced by Trump, following four days of fighting and diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p><small>2025-05-12 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604235-pakistan-indian-dgmos-discuss-ceasefire-to-consider-troops-reduction-from-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India DGMOs discuss ceasefire, to ‘consider troops reduction' from borders</strong></a><br><p>

Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other’s military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.
Confirming the talks to Dawn.com, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was “quite standard”.
State media outlets Radio Pakistan and PTV News confirmed the talks as well.
 






Reuters also reported that the Indian army confirmed that the DGMOs spoke by phone today.
“Issues related to continuing the commitment that both sides must not fire a single shot or initiate any aggressive and inimical action against each other were discussed,” the Indian army said.
“It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,” it added.
 






The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers.
Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of strikes on Pakistan on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in civilian casualties.
Hotline message
India’s military sent a “hotline” message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi’s intent to respond to further such incidents, Reuters reported, citing a top Indian army officer.
However, the Foreign Office and the Pakistan military’s spokesperson rubbished the allegations.
“In spite of some minor damage, all our military bases and systems continue to remain fully operational,” India’s director general of air operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti, claimed in a media briefing today.
India also reopened 32 airports it had shut during the clashes, with the Airports Authority of India saying in a statement they were available for civil operations. Some schools remained closed.
Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.
Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a Reuters witness said.</p><small>2025-05-12 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12221031058614a.jpg?r=221111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910584/prosecutor-says-sean-diddy-combs-forced-women-to-participate-in-sex-parties-blackmailed-them-with-videos' target='_blank'><strong>Prosecutor says Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs forced women to participate in sex parties, blackmailed them with videos</strong></a><br><p>Hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs went on trial on sex trafficking charges on Monday, with prosecutors saying the Bad Boy Records founder lured women into romantic relationships, forced them to take part in days of drug-fuelled sex parties and then blackmailed them with videos he recorded of the encounters.
Combs “viciously attacked” women when they resisted taking part in the parties, known as ‘freak offs’ or otherwise upset him, prosecutor Emily Johnson said during her opening statement in Manhattan federal court.
She told jurors they would hear testimony from victims who said Combs, 55, routinely beat them and exploded with rage at the smallest slights. The case has drawn intense media coverage because of Combs’ fame.
“They will tell you about some of the most painful experiences of their lives. The days they spent in hotel rooms, high on drugs, dressed in costumes to perform the defendant’s sexual fantasies,” Johnson said.
Defence lawyer Teny Geragos countered that prosecutors were trying to twist Combs’ romantic relationships into a racketeering and sex trafficking case.
“Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case. This case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,” Geragos said in her opening statement.
Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could face life in prison.

Combs’ mother, Janice Combs, sat in the front row of the courtroom along with six of her son’s children. Combs wore a beige sweater over a white collared shirt and khakis. He smiled at his family and blew them a kiss before taking his seat with his lawyers.
Prosecutors have accused Combs of using his fame and fortune to abuse women. The defence is expected to counter that the activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and say there was nothing illegal about a “swingers” lifestyle in which Combs and his girlfriends occasionally brought a third person into their relationships.
Over the course of a two-month trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from three and possibly four of the rapper’s female accusers, as well as his former employees who prosecutors say helped arrange and cover up his actions.
Latest entertainer to face #MeToo charges
Allegations of sexual abuse in the criminal charges brought against Combs by the Manhattan US Attorney’s office last year made him the latest powerful man in the entertainment industry to be accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak up about abuse.
Combs is known for turning rap and rhythm and blues artists like Notorious BIG. and Mary J Blige into stars, and in the process elevating the mainstream appeal of hip-hop in American culture in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Born in Manhattan’s Harlem neighbourhood and raised by a single mother, Combs went on to live in mansions in Miami and Los Angeles and host lavish parties for the cultural elite in destinations like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez.

Prosecutors say his success concealed a dark side. Over two decades, Combs used violence and threats to force women to take part in the ‘freak offs’, according to the indictment.
Combs would often watch the performances, masturbate and film them, sometimes using the recordings as blackmail to ensure his alleged victims did not report his abuse, prosecutors say.
In one 2016 incident that was captured on hotel surveillance footage that prosecutors plan to show the jury, Combs was seen kicking and dragging a woman as she was trying to leave a ‘freak off’, prosecutors say.
CNN last year broadcast footage that appeared to show Combs attacking his former girlfriend, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra Ventura, in 2016 in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs apologised after the video aired.
Cassie among first witnesses
Ventura, known professionally as Cassie, is among the first witnesses expected to testify against Combs.
Combs’ defence strategy at trial will hinge on undermining the credibility of the women who testify against Combs, including by arguing they were motivated by money to accuse him of wrongdoing and have unreliable memories.
Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lead lawyer, has said the 2016 hotel incident depicted the aftermath of a dispute over infidelity and was not evidence of sex trafficking. In a court hearing on Friday, Agnifilo said Ventura had a history of domestic violence, undercutting prosecutors’ argument that she was a victim.
Ventura’s lawyer declined to comment.</p><small>2025-05-12 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604216-pakistan-army-issues-details-of-anti-india-operation-names-days-long-conflict-marka-e-haq' target='_blank'><strong>Army issues details of anti-India operation, names days-long conflict 'Marka-e-Haq'</strong></a><br><p>

In recent months, Karachi witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Surjani Town Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn.com that three persons were traveling in a car when a “speeding” dumper struck them on the Northern Bypass near Hamdard University.
“The police rushed to the scene after receiving information of the accident. Police found the car crushed beneath the dumper while the three occupants were found dead on the spot,” he added.
He continued that the driver managed to escape from the scene before police reached there.
“However, the suspect Gul Baig was subsequently arrested.”
The deceased were identified as Suleman, 60, his son Usama, 35, and Faraz Sikander, 40. The bodies were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed widespread protests by residents, political parties and civil rights campaigners over the alarming increase in fatal incidents involving heavy vehicles mainly dumper trucks.
The provincial government has made efforts to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, including a ban on daytime movement of heavy vehicles, and imposing fines on reckless driving.
On April 18, the city administration extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.
The ban on the movement of heavy vehicles was initially imposed for two months on Feb 14 in the wake of traffic accidents. While allowing heavy vehicles to operate in the city from 10pm to 6am, the city administration authorised the district and traffic police to register cases against the violators of the ban.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi said that vehicles carrying essential commodities such as water, cooking oil, medicine, oxygen cylinders for medical facilities, meat and other items were exempted from the ban.
3 murdered over family dispute
Three people were shot dead while two others injured when relatives fought against each other off National Highway, according to a police officer.
“A quarrel erupted between relatives over some personal enmity at Razzaqabad during which firearms were used, resulting in the death of three persons and injuries to two others,” Shah Latif Town SHO Mohammed Ameen Khoso told Dawn.com.
The three persons gunned down in the incident were identified as Usman Munsif, 20, Touqeer Siddiq, 25, and Touseef Bashir, 30. The injured include Noman Bashir, 20, and Munsif Latif, 45.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that two persons with gunshot injuries were brought dead at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) while the third one succumbed during treatment.
The SHO said the police arrested one suspect from the scene and a pistol was recovered from his possession. “The police are further investigating the triple murder and efforts are under way to arrest the remaining suspects,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-12 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1217330355f12d5.jpg?r=174859' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555/as-trump-heads-to-the-gulf-israel-asks-where-the-us-stands' target='_blank'><strong>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</strong></a><br><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington’s priorities.
On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had been informed by the US of an agreement to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.
Trump, who will be visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel’s main airport.
“The message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,” wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli news outlets Ynet, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.
One Israeli official said Trump’s announcement on the Houthis was “kind of an embarrassment” and that the president acts “for good and for bad”.
Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump’s decision-making.
One senior official in Netanyahu’s circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was “chaos” in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.
Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.
The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.
Israel faced further alarm after Reuters reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.
“We coordinate. It doesn’t mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.
“The US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.”
In March, Trump’s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as “very helpful” meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.
Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and “that word is still operative”.
“The president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue,” he said.
‘Chaos’
Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander’s release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.
“There’s just no leadership now,” said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.
There was “no question” the deal happened behind Netanyahu’s back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.
“Right now, it’s every man for himself,” Gottlieb said.
Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.
Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.
The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh’s insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.
Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.
Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.
By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.
“But we don’t have a choice,” said one.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604172-india-resumes-operations-at-32-airports-after-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan asks Junaid Akbar to 'step down' as PAC chairman</strong></a><br><p>
