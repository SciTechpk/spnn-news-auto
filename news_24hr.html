On Thursday, the FIA booked him over allegations of issuing unauthorised income tax refunds amounting to Rs16 billion during his tenure as FBR chairman. Sources said the FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle had accused Zaidi of criminal misconduct, abuse of authority, and unauthorised disbursement of public funds.
According to the FIA, three private banks, two cement factories, and one chemical company were the beneficiaries of these refunds. The agency alleged that these entities were clients of Zaidi’s private audit and consultancy firm prior to his appointment as FBR chairman, raising concerns of conflict of interest.
However, a notification issued by the agency’s Karachi division on Thursday said: “The Director, FIA Karachi Zone, has been pleased to accord permission for cancellation of case FIR No. 32/2025 dated 29.10.2025 … as well as classification of case as ‘C-Class’ and submission of discharge report … against the then chairman FBR (1) Syed Muhammad Shabbar Zaidi.”</p><small>2025-10-31 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3117221662e3010.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952359/shc-orders-committee-to-visit-karachi-zoo-for-brown-bear-rano-inspection-on-nov-2' target='_blank'><strong>SHC orders committee to visit Karachi zoo for brown bear Rano inspection on Nov 2</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) court on Friday ordered a committee formed by the Sindh chief minister to visit the Karachi Zoo on November 2 and prepare a report on the condition of the animals there, including Rano, the brown bear.
The case of Rano, a female Himalayan brown bear who stirred public outcry over her ailing health in the zoo, has brought into sharp focus the neglect of animals kept in captivity in Karachi. She will be relocated to a bear rehabilitation centre under the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, before being moved to Gilgit-Baltistan on the SHC’s directives.
In a previous order dated October 17 — available with Dawn.com — SHC Justice Iqbal Kalhoro ordered the committee to visit the Karachi Zoo in the company of petitioner Jude Allen Pereira, Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro from the Sindh Institute of Animal Health, Advocate Jibran Nasir and wildlife photographer Zafeer Ahmed Shaikh and prepare a detailed report highlighting the “number of animals, their physical and mental condition and the circumstances under which they have been kept”.
According to a copy of today’s order posted on X by Nasir, the judge observed that the October 17 order had not been complied with and no visits to the zoo had been scheduled by the committee. It also noted that the cage had not been placed in Rano’s enclosure and that letters from Nasir to the committee had gone unanswered.
“With the consent of learned AAG, we fix [November 2] as a date for visit by the committee constituted in terms of order dated [October 10] to visit the own bear and other animals to ascertain their physical and mental health, especially of brown bear for the shifting of which to Islamabad this petition has been filed. Matter is already fixed on [November 6] and be taken the same date,” the order reads.
 






Nasir filed an application earlier today for an urgent hearing on the petition, arguing that no action has been taken regarding Rano’s relocation by the authorities.
“On October 17, government officials had asked for two weeks’ time for the transfer,” Nasir contended. “Despite writing a letter to the committee members on October 22, no member has responded yet.”
The lawyer added that Rano’s cage has not been prepared for her transfer, noting that it would take some time for her to acclimate to it once it’s ready.
 
 

“A team from Islamabad has examined Rano. The team has confirmed the presence of insects in three wounds on Rano’s body,” Nasir emphasised. “We want as many animals as possible to be inspected in daylight.”
Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3115063385c4392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941192/monetary-policy-at-a-crossroads-can-the-sbp-sustain-its-credibility' target='_blank'><strong>Monetary policy at a crossroads: Can the SBP sustain its credibility?</strong></a><br><p>In Pakistan’s turbulent economic landscape, credibility becomes currency. And over the past year and a half, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has quietly been building it. Where once monetary policy was dismissed as toothless, the central bank has now shown that a steady hand can calm markets, anchor expectations, and restore confidence.
On October 27, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent — the fourth consecutive hold since May 2025. This came after a series of measured adjustments: from June 2023 to May 2025, the SBP cut rates cautiously from 22pc to 11pc. Each move was calculated, with pauses where necessary, resisting market pressure for a steep, one-off reduction.
The strategy appeared to be deliberate. Instead of succumbing to calls for a dramatic cut, the SBP moved gradually. This paid off. The rupee remained steady. Inflation bottomed out below 1pc in April 2025. And by May, consumer confidence surged to 44.6pc — the highest in four years.
True, other forces helped: lower economic growth, rollovers, controlled imports behind the rupee’s stability, and a higher base and decline in oil prices all eased the pressure. But the SBP’s measured stance significantly contributed to economic stability and strengthened the credibility of the monetary policy itself.
Walking the monetary tightrope
Going forward, however, the SBP, will confront even more structural and policy challenges. The advantage of a low base will no longer be available. Average inflation stood at just 4.5pc in FY2024, compared to a steep 24.5pc in FY2023. This implies that even modest increases in absolute prices during FY2025–26 could translate into higher inflation rates due to the elevated base effect. Early signs of this trend are already visible, with the consumer price index (CPI) inflation rising to 3.5pc in May from 0.3pc in April.
Moreover, the economic landscape is changing. The pursuit of higher growth, projected at 4.2pc in FY2025–26, alongside rising global oil prices, an increase in the petroleum development levy (PDL) from Rs70 to Rs100 per litre, and an opening economy under the new tariff policy, will all test inflation control. The rupee is likely to come under pressure. Early signs are already evident: it dropped to 283 a dollar on June 25 from 279 a dollar on April 25. The energy price hike to finance capacity payments, further catalysed by the PDL increase on top of already increasing prices, will trigger another wave of inflation. This will test the extent to which the SBP’s policy can manage price stability.
Money supply growth will be another challenge facing the SBP. Over the past 12 months (July to July), broad money (M3) in Pakistan grew by 14.31pc, compared to 6.25pc in Bangladesh. Cash in circulation (M1) increased more in Pakistan (15.79pc) than in India (11.96pc) over the same period. In contrast, Bangladesh recorded a slight contraction of 0.01pc in M1 during this time. Pakistan’s real GDP growth stood at 2.6pc in FY2024-25, compared to 6.5pc and 3.9pc for India and Bangladesh, respectively. This increased liquidity, particularly cash expansion, may create inflation headwinds. The SBP must ensure effective control over the substantial expansion in money supply.
For these reasons, the central bank must exercise greater caution in its next moves. The absence of a higher base effect and the temporary benefit of a sharp decline in inflation due to the wheat crop crash will be a real test for the SBP. This phase will help distinguish the impact of tight monetary policy from exogenous factors that have temporarily produced a favourable inflation outcome.
The SBP will also face scrutiny regarding its choice of reference inflation for policy rate decisions. Recently, it relied on sticky core inflation to justify a smaller-than-expected rate cut. The higher real interest rate, reaching 10pc in April, with interest rate and CPI inflation clocking at 11pc and 0.5pc respectively, was defended form a position of core inflation. Going forward, if CPI inflation rises and converges with the current policy rate of 10pc, the SBP will face limited options. It may have to raise interest rates again to maintain positive real rates. At the same time, the IMF’s condition of sustaining a higher positive real interest rate will likely exert additional pressure for a further rate hike.
This, consequently, may hurt the run for growth. Businesses sentiments will be a key pressure to keep rates low. In these testing times, the SBP should focus on maintaining low and stable inflation rather than rushing to support growth. There are dozens of other departments and policies designed to promote growth, but only one institution is responsible for keeping inflation low and stable.
Breaking the perception that the SBP’s policies are influenced by IMF conditions will be another challenge, as it risks damaging the credibility of an independent SBP and its autonomous monetary policy. There is widespread belief that the slow reduction in the policy rate was driven by the IMF’s condition to maintain a higher positive real interest rate. While this may not appear to directly affect the SBP, it can undermine the credibility of its policies in the medium to long term. The SBP needs to strengthen its communication efforts to dispel these perceptions.
The missing link in SBP’s credibility
During our interactions with the SBP in 2022–23 on monetary policy communication, we strongly recommended that monetary policy statements include a simplified, non-technical summary to enhance public understanding and improve the transmission of monetary policy. This proposal was received favourably by the SBP’s senior leadership at the time, who expressed a clear commitment to implement the change. However, as of now, this improvement in communication strategy has yet to materialise in practice. The year 2025–26 may mark the beginning of this shift.
A more systematic engagement with the media, the inclusion of non-technical summaries explaining the reasoning behind key decisions, and a nuanced digital outreach strategy could significantly improve the SBP’s public communication, particularly regarding monetary policy. The SBP also needs to make better use of its WhatsApp channel to reach non-technical audiences through policy messaging, rather than limiting it to a static “announcement forum” for decisions. Beyond what has been decided, these platforms should also communicate (using accessible language) why the decisions have been made.
The SBP also needs to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into its communication and engagement strategies, as well as its decision-making analysis. AI tools are increasingly supporting central banks in refining monetary and financial stability messaging, identifying communication gaps, and strengthening public engagement. Some are even using it for sentiment analysis using data from social media — going beyond traditional, periodic confidence and expectation surveys.
Interestingly, AI has emerged as a preferred tool for central banks to simplify information and enhance strategic communications. The Benchmarking Communication Survey 2024, shows that around one in five surveyed central banks’ communication departments (mainly in Europe) have already adopted AI tools to support their work. Conversational AI systems can distil lengthy, technical reports into accessible summaries for the general public. It is time for the SBP to formulate a clear policy framework for adopting such modern AI tools and channels across its operations.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631457-mild-earthquake-tremors-felt-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Mild earthquake tremors felt in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The KSE-100 index rose by 4898.86 points, or 3.13 per cent, to close at 161,631.73 points, breaking a seven-day losing streak.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market rebounded today on “reports of Pakistan–Afghanistan ceasefire talks, the end of rollover week, and renewed institutional buying after the recent correction opened up valuations”.
“Focus now shifts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and any revenue measures (including possible tax increases) needed to meet targets,” he said, adding that investors will also watch Monday’s trade balance data for cues on the economic outlook.
“Retail investors should use equities primarily for long-term wealth creation, set asset allocation by age, liquidity needs and risk appetite, and avoid overexposure if they have short-term cash requirements,” he said, adding that “volatility is normal and should be expected”.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com that after the continuation of the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the market shifted focus “back to improving macroeconomic fundamentals”.
He added that the stocks of companies that reported strong results, or were pursuing expansion plans, saw sharp recoveries.
“In the near term, key triggers include the IMF Executive Board’s approval for the release of US$1.2bn, the financial close of the Reko Diq project, and the renegotiation of regasified liquified natural gas contracts with Qatar,” he said.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also agreed that the ceasefire with Afghanistan had helped market sentiment as he attributed the rally to “easing geopolitical tensions”.</p><small>2025-10-31 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631441-pa-speaker-urges-immediate-27th-amendment-to-empower-local-governments' target='_blank'><strong>PA speaker urges immediate 27th Amendment to empower local governments</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement from the KP government, the cabinet’s swearing-in ceremony took place at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
“KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath,” the statement said. “Those sworn in as provincial ministers included Meena Khan Afridi, Arshad Ayub Khan, Amjad Ali, Aftab Alam Afridi, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Khaleequr Rehman, Riaz Khan, Syed Fakhar Jehan, Aqibullah Khan and Faisal Khan Tarakai.
“KP Governor Kundi congratulated the newly sworn-in provincial ministers and expressed his best wishes to them,” it added.
According to an earlier summary sent to the KP governor by the provincial government, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, CM Afridi had selected his cabinet members, while also picking Muzammil Aslam and Taj Muhammad as advisers, and Shafi Jan as a special assistant.
The PTI’s KP chapter had also confirmed the names in a post on social media platform X.
 






Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra congratulated the new provincial cabinet and wished them all the best.
 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive earlier this month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly were criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-10-31 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631439-karachis-temperature-could-rise-in-upcoming-days' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi's temperature could rise in upcoming days</strong></a><br><p>

On Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS). Under the new mechanism, traffic police personnel monitor real-time violations through surveillance cameras installed across the city and dispatch tickets to the home addresses of the violators.
On Tuesday, more than 2,650 electronic challans were issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the system’s inauguration, amounting to up to Rs1.2 million.
Today’s decision was notified in a letter written by the director inspector general (DIG) of the Training Department of Sindh police to DIG Police Karachi, DIGs Traffic Karachi, Technical and Transport, Rapid Response Force, Special Protection Unit, Crime and Investigations, Counter-terrorism department (CTD) and Special Branch.
“The training — to begin from November 1 — will aim to strengthen the skills of police drivers and make them aware of the new TRACS law,” the missive said.
A total of 925 drivers from different departments of the Sindh police will receive training, which will be held over the course of two sessions, as per the missive.
Separately, in a statement, spokesperson Sindh police said that “500 personnel from Karachi range, 100 from traffic police, 100 from T&T, 50 from RRF, 25 from SPU/CPEC, 25 from Crime and Investigation, 25 from CTD, 50 from Special Branch and 50 from DIG Training will receive the training.”
The training sessions will be held at the Scouts Auditorium of the Sindh Boys Scout Association, the spokesperson added.
On Thursday,  a petition was filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC) impugning the system in the metropolis. The petition pleaded to declare its implementation, without prior adequate road infrastructure and ownership-verification safeguards, as illegal and unconstitutional.
Lawmakers of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) also voiced serious concerns over the implementation of the e-challan system, terming it a financial burden on citizens rather than a solution to traffic chaos.
What is the e-ticketing system?
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Admin Karachi Traffic Police Kashif explained that the system has been introduced as part of the Karachi Safe City Project.
A total of 1,076 cameras have been installed on main thoroughfares in the first phase.
When phases 2 and 3 of the initiative are completed, up to 12,000 cameras will have been installed in all areas of Karachi as well as on toll plazas.
Once a challan is initiated, it will be sent via Pakistan Post to an address linked to the number plate issued by the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department.
While the total time to pay off the challan is 21 days, if it is paid within 14 days, the violator would get a 50 per cent waiver on the amount. However, failure to pay within 21 days will result in the total amount being doubled on the 22nd day.</p><small>2025-10-31 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311643508c2c4c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952357/corruption-extortion-case-lahore-court-extends-physical-remand-of-6-nccia-officials-by-3-days' target='_blank'><strong>Corruption, extortion case: Lahore court extends physical remand of 6 NCCIA officials by 3 days</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore court on Friday extended the physical remand of six National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials by another three days in a case pertaining to the alleged misuse of authority, extortion of money, and acceptance of bribes.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR was registered against a total of nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest on Monday.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials.
The six were presented in the court of Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo, with the FIA’s investigating officer (IO) requesting further 11 days of physical remand to continue the investigation.
Accepting the request, the judge remanded the suspects into three more days of physical custody to complete the investigation and ordered their appearance on Monday.
According to the court order, the counsels for the suspects variously argued that their clients were wrongly nominated in the case or alleged irregularities in the complaint against them. They also raised questions about the recoveries made.
Meanwhile, the FIA’s legal counsel strongly opposed all contentions and contended that it was a white collar crime.
“Earlier three days physical remand was granted and different heavy amounts were recovered from all accused persons. Learned counsels pointed out illegalities and irregularities in said alleged recoveries but this court has no mandate to decide said questions during remand at this stage. Heavy amounts are recovered from all accused persons. Progress is happened. Contention of IO looks plausible for further physical remand to make investigation due to said heavy amount recoveries. Contention of learned counsels looks not plausible to discharge accused persons at this stage,” the order said.
FIR
The FIR was registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9 million” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August 2025, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Salman Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping, while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen had been assigned the investigation of the case.

“In line with the ministry’s declaration of 2025-26 as the Year of Customer Service Improvement, Discos have embarked on a comprehensive digitalisation drive to modernise their infrastructure,” said a statement by the Power Division.
“This initiative aims to ensure real-time data availability, transparency, and enhanced customer experience.”
Recognising that the pricing of smart meters was a major impediment in this transformation, the Power Division actively intervened to rationalise costs, said the statement, adding that out of nearly 38 million electricity consumers nationwide, around 80 per cent are single-phase users.
The statement pointed out that until recently, the cost of a single-phase smart meter was around Rs20,000, which is “significantly higher than international benchmarks”.
“Through strategic interventions, open and transparent procurement, and continuous monitoring, the price has now been reduced to approximately Rs15,000,” the Division said.
“This intervention alone will result in an estimated annual national saving of around Rs25 billion, considering 5m meter replacements per annum,” the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.
“The reduced meter cost will also ease the financial burden on consumers applying for smart meters, making advanced technology more affordable and accessible. It is further anticipated that through upcoming international competitive bidding processes, the prices will decline even further.”
According to the division, this intervention will ensure “significant improvement” in the meter reading process because human involvement will be minimal.
“Automated and remote readings will not only enhance accuracy but also build consumer trust in the billing system,” the statement detailed. “The elimination of manual readings will address long-standing concerns about faulty or disputed readings, fostering a more transparent and reliable relationship between consumers and their respective Discos”.
Once deployed, according to the division, smart meters will enable consumers to monitor their electricity usage in real time through mobile applications equipped with modern features. “This will empower consumers to better control their energy consumption and manage their electricity costs.”
Among the benefits for consumers, the division listed the following: real-time monitoring of electricity usage, greater control over energy consumption and billing, accurate, tamper-proof meter readings, and future enablement of prepaid metering services
On the other hand, the division said the benefits for Discos would include remote meter reading and billing accuracy, faster billing and complaint resolution, enhanced visibility and control of the power network, real-time outage detection and quicker fault restoration, as well as improved safety and operational management
“This initiative marks a significant milestone in the Power Division’s continued efforts to digitalise Pakistan’s power sector and provide efficient, transparent, and customer-centric electricity services,” the statement added.
“It is a key step toward the digitalisation of the power distribution system, which remains a crucial part of the ongoing power sector reform agenda of the Government of Pakistan.”
Last year, while chairing a review meeting on the performance of Discos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had termed overbilling by power utility companies as “unacceptable” and had called for the installation of smart meters to measure electricity use accurately.
According to the PM, these meters would ensure transparency in the billing system.</p><small>2025-10-31 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311617245b90525.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952354/pakistan-hopes-for-positive-outcome-of-next-round-of-talks-with-kabul-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan hopes for positive outcome of next round of talks with Kabul: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain And­ra­­bi said on Friday that Pakistan hoped for a “positive outcome” of the next round of talks with the Afghan Taliban set to begin on November 6.
“Pakistan will continue to remain engaged in the mediation process and hopes for a positive outcome for the November 6 talks,” he said during a weekly FO briefing.
 
 

The talks were scheduled as Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire between the two countries and following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month.
The agreement capped five days of a second round of tense negotiations — with the first one held in Doha on October 18 and 19 — in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar. The round, which had begun on Saturday, had reached a point of near-collapse on Wednesday, with Islamabad saying that its long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan remained a major point of contention.
But a breakthrough in the stalemate came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week.
Andrabi recalled during today’s briefing that the second round of talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime in the presence of mediators concluded in Istanbul yesterday evening.
“Pakistan participated in the Istanbul talks, which started on October 25, in a good spirit and with a positive intention,” he added.
The FO spokesperson said the talks were initially scheduled for two days.
“However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistan side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days.
“Pakistan positively engaged with the Taliban regime without compromising on its clearly stated position that Afghanistan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan.”
He asserted that Pakistan did not seek further escalation of hostilities but “expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitment to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, and Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term that the state uses for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Andrabi said that Pakistan had been urging the Afghan Taliban for the past four years to take “decisive and effective measures” against terrorist outfits present on Afghanistan soil.
“We repeatedly shared credible information about the presence of top leadership of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan on Afghan soil with the Taliban regime. However, despite repeated assurances in the past, there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan.”
He said the “consistent and total disregard” of Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by the Afghan Taliban over the last four years and the “unprovoked aggression against Pakistan with the support of Fitna-al-Khawarij on Oct 11 and 12 and later Oct 14 and 15 led to violent exchanges across the international border”.
“Pakistan decisively responded to Afghan provocation aimed at destabilising the border area, facilitating terrorism, and furthering the Fitna-al-Khawarij’s nefarious designs”.
Pakistan would respond resolutely if provocations continue in the future, he further warned.
The FO spokesperson emphasised that Pakistan had always been desirous of a peaceful, stable and regionally integrated and prosperous Afghanistan, “which is at peace with itself and its neighbours”.
“With the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, we expected the vision of regional peace and connectivity to be realised.
“In the same spirit, despite our various security concerns, Pakistan took many initiatives this year to support and help Afghanistan and extended a number of concessions to Afghanistan, especially for Afghan transit trade”.
He further highlighted that Islamabad had elevated its diplomatic representation with Afghanistan from charge d’affaires to the ambassador level and also agreed to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project to Afghanistan.
 
 

Andrabi recalled that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had visited Kabul thrice, including on July 17, to sign an agreement on the joint feasibility study of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project.
He further stated that the “government and armed forces stand ready to take all possible measures to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty and ensure the safety and security of its people”.
The FO spokesperson then went on to appreciate the “constructive role of brotherly countries of Qatar and Turkiye”.
“They have been making their best efforts for an amicable and peaceful resolution of the issue,” he said.
‘Ceasefire can’t be effective until terrorism stops’
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who had been particularly directing strong criticism towards Afghanistan since the beginning of border hostilities earlier this month, also confirmed while speaking to Geo News that an interim agreement had been reached between the two countries with the mediation of Turkiye and Qatar.
“Another round of negotiations will be held on November 6,” he said.
Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul.
The defence minister further said, “There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan”, and also emphasised that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire can not be effective.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, after Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts, the two sides to continue the ceasefire, set up a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace along their shared border and penalise any violators.</p><small>2025-10-31 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631425-pak-afghan-relations-can-never-normalise-unless-kabul-reins-in-ttp-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pak-Afghan relations can never normalise unless Kabul reins in TTP: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

Indian news outlet Republic TV had made the allegations, specifying the number of soldiers Pakistan was planning to send to Gaza “under the supervision of Western countries and Israel.” The channel, according to a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, had also “ridiculously claimed that Pakistan had also removed the ‘Not valid for Israel’ clause from the passport.”
In a statement on X, the information ministry referred to a press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa), reiterating that “Pakistan’s stance on Israel remains unchanged, that is, Islamabad does not recognise Israel, and no military cooperation or engagement exists or is under discussion”.
 






Moreover, the ministry clarified that the passport clause remained intact.
“Directorate General of Immigration and Passports confirms it still reads ‘valid for all countries except Israel’”, said the statement.
Mofa’s stance, as pointed out by the ministry, is that Pakistan does not recognise Israel and steadfastly supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
“The claim originates solely from Republic TV, known for sensationalised anti-Pakistan narratives,” the information ministry added. “No international or regional media outlet has carried the assertion.”
The ministry further urged reliance on official statements and verified policy updates and to avoid “unverified or politically charged claims from partisan media”.
‘Decision to send troops to Gaza to be finalised’: defence minister
Earlier this week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said that the decision to send Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
Questioned whether any such move was in the offing or not in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said: “This thing has to be finalised [and] it is in process. The government will decide to pass through the process, and I don’t want to preempt it.”
He said parliament would be taken on board and all institutions would be informed about the move.
The defence minister said if Muslim countries took a decision to participate in the peace force and Pakistan also had to take part, then it would be a “moment of pride for the country to play a role in protecting Palestinians”.
“This is an opportunity that Pakistan should avail itself of if it is available to us.”</p><small>2025-10-31 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311404506683424.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952150/the-us-is-attacking-the-publics-right-to-know' target='_blank'><strong>The US is attacking the public’s right to know</strong></a><br><p>The public’s right to know is in serious jeopardy in the United States. The country that once proudly lauded its commitment to free expression and a free press has rapidly adopted the behaviour of autocrats to stifle reporting it does not like.
From new rules that threaten the ability of journalists to report on defence (the country’s largest federal employer and third largest expenditure) to spurious lawsuits from the President against news outlets whose reporting he dislikes (some of whom settled, apparently in fear of greater punishment) to regulatory overreach and the gutting of public media, the United States looks less like the champion of a free press and more like its nemesis.
This is not hyperbole. The organisation that I run — the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — has worked on issues related to press freedom and journalists safety for more than four decades.
Press freedom under siege
Since 1992, CPJ has meticulously documented the killings, arrests, and disappearances of journalists. We know, and academic research shows, that media censorship — tighter regulations, funding cuts (coupled with investments in pliant media), smear campaigns and legal threats — are a precursor to the curtailment of broader freedoms and rights. And we are seeing precisely that in the United States — not just in real time but at high speed.
What began with the White House banning the Associated Press from its press pool (and thus the hundreds of news outlets across the country that rely on its services) in January has since morphed into a multi-pronged attack on the press.
The attack vectors are familiar to us at CPJ as keen observers of autocratic behaviour: the misuse of law to attack news outlets deemed unfriendly to the regime (this has included lawsuits from Trump against ABC News, CBS News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times); the increased politicisation of the regulator (ABC briefly suspended comedian Jimmy Kimmel after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, objected to remarks Kimmel had made on air and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, “These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Kimmel was reinstated, but some operators continued to refuse to carry the show); and the slashing of funding for public media (the Trump administration has all but eliminated funding that was going to support independent media overseas, gutted entities such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, and slashed funding for public media at home to the bone).
This matters not because the press is special per se. It matters because of the role the press plays: the role of holding power to account, of exposing corruption and wrongdoing, of helping people access information that is vital to their everyday lives. When wildfires ripped through California earlier this year, for example, listenership to the local radio station KNX News rose 354 per cent as anxious locals turned to the reliable sources with on the ground reporters to understand what was happening and help mitigate risk.
When a free press is curtailed, individual freedoms — which rely on access to independent information — are curtailed too. Fighting back now matters because failure to address these curtailments, and the impunity that follows, creates a breeding ground for further restrictions, as we’ve seen before from Buenos Aires to Budapest. And just as restrictions take a multi-pronged approach, so too must resistance.
Resistance takes root
Thankfully, we are seeing such resistance. We’re seeing it in the use of legal avenues to challenge administrative overreach. So far this year CPJ has supported eight court submissions led by our colleagues at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), that aim to reverse decisions that threaten a free press.
We, along with Free Press, have also pushed for and vigorously supported the ACLU’s habeas corpus case to challenge the wrongful detention and eventual deportation of journalist Mario Guevara. With colleagues at the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF), Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), PEN America and RCFP, we’re stepping up the provision of safety training and advice. And we’re seeing journalists and newsrooms (though sadly not all) refuse to be cowed.
It is easy to say support certain freedoms and rights when those rights are not contested. The real test is the willingness to do so even, and especially when, that defence brings potential significant risk.
Impunity — and with it, the persistent erosion of rights — thrives when those who purport to believe in these rights, and indeed benefit from them, choose silence. George Orwell called this out in his original planned preface to Animal Farm where he noted: “…the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI [Ministry of Information] or any official body. If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves.”
Tackling impunity, then, in the United States as elsewhere, begins with a basic first step: the refusal to remain silent.

His comments come against the backdrop of recent tensions with Afghanistan over Islamabad’s long-standing concern regarding terrorist attacks emanating from Kabul. For its part, Islamabad has demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, in May, the country faced a military standoff — the worst in decades — with neighbouring India. Following an intense, four-day escalation, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the United States.
Addressing a meeting today with students and academics from universities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Abbottabad district, the DG ISPR asserted, “The armed forces remain committed to defending the country, and any external aggression will be met with a firm and severe response,” as per ISPR.
Lt Gen Chaudhry detailed that “Pakistan has taken effective steps against terrorism and Fitna Al Khwarij.”
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Since the group ended a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022, the country has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces.
The statement further mentioned that during the meeting, Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the current security situation, including Pak-Afghan tensions and Marka-i-Haq,“ adding that “students and teachers present paid tribute to martyrs.
The Pakistan Army has named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq”.
Vice Chancellor Hazara University, Dr Ikramullah Khan, lauded the armed forces’ role and vowed to stand with them, the statement said.
“Pakistan army’s resolve is a metaphor for their love for the country,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.
Khan was of the view that “terrorist elements are aiming to mislead our youth,” emphasising that the situation called for the dissemination of “accurate and reliable information.”
Per the statement, both students and teachers echoed similar views, stating that the discussion with DG ISPR “had helped dispel any false information they had regarding the Pakistan army, as well as the national and provincial situation.”
On October 21, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had said that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response.“</p><small>2025-10-31 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3110483221b00cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952189/istanbul-dialogue-pakistan-afghanistan-agree-to-continue-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Istanbul dialogue: Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to continue ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month.
A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Türkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Wednesday that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
A joint statement released by Türkiye, the host of the latest round of talks, early on Friday stated “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
Though the statement didn’t specify who the “principals” would be, it is expected that it meant the defence ministers of the two countries, who led their sides in the first round in Doha, would now meet in Istanbul.
The joint statement further said that during this period, the two countries also agreed on a “monitoring and verification mechanism” to ensure the maintenance of peace and to impose a penalty on the side that breaches the ceasefire.
“All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and to impose penalties on the violating party,” said the joint statement released by Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 






The statement further said that as mediators, Türkiye and Qatar expressed their appreciation for the “active contribution of both parties” and the two countries will continue their cooperation with both sides for “lasting peace and stability”.
The same statement was also released by Qatar’s foreign ministry.
 






Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, commenting on the development, said, “Just as the Islamic emirate seeks good relations with other neighbouring countries, it also desires positive ties with Pakistan and remains committed to relations based on mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs and not posing a threat to any side.”
The joint statement came shortly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had earlier issued a strongly worded warning to Kabul after the stalemate in talks — said that a “ray of light” was visible in the Istanbul negotiations.
“Different drafts are being exchanged for an eventual agreement. You can say that some ray of light is visible; there is very guarded optimism. Let’s hope that some shape emerges from this,“ he stated while speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
“Qatar and Türkiye are very respected by us and are our well-wishers. Türkiye clearly openly supported us in the Pakistan-India conflict, so we respect them and their opinion,” the defence minister said.
‘Verifiable action’
The Istanbul negotiations centred on Pakistan’s core demand that Afghanistan take “clear, verifiable and irreversible action” against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist groups involved in cross-border attacks from Afghan territory.
Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, speaking earlier in Peshawar, reiterated Pakistan’s red lines, saying that while Islamabad desired peace with all its neighbours, it “will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil against Pakistan.”
The Taliban delegation, while participating in the dialogue, however, maintained that it could not fully control TTP operatives. A senior Taliban official said the Afghan side had offered to detain and expel any TTP members found on Afghan territory.
“But Pakistan keeps insisting that we control TTP’s attacks inside Pakistan,” the official said. “These fighters are Pakistani nationals operating within Pakistan.”
Pakistani negotiators also demanded that the Taliban formally declare the TTP a terrorist organisation and publicly denounce it as a fitna — an Islamic term for sedition or mischief.
Diplomatic sources said direct interaction between the two delegations remained limited throughout the five days, with most communication handled through mediators. “Even during meal breaks, the sides barely spoke,” one source said.
Afghanistan continues to deny harbouring militants, accusing Pakistan instead of violating its sovereignty through airstrikes and, according to Afghan media, allowing US drones to operate from its airspace — a charge Islamabad denies. Kabul insisted during the talks that any future agreement must include assurances against such operations.
While the Istanbul agreement marks a breakthrough after days of tension, diplomats cautioned that deep mistrust persists. “This is a framework for peace, not yet peace itself,” a foreign diplomat said. “It will take sustained verification, discipline and trust to make it hold.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311148147655d3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952342/islamabad-atc-issues-notice-to-police-in-narcotics-and-terrorism-case-against-journalist-matiullah-jan' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues notice to police in narcotics and terrorism case against journalist Matiullah Jan</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court in Islamabad issued a notice to police on Friday on an application for the provision of documents in a narcotics and terrorism case registered against senior journalist Matiullah Jan.
The case, registered at Margalla Police Station on November 28 last year, accuses the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics.
Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan has drawn strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintain that he is being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November last year.
 
 

At the outset of the hearing today, lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq submitted a power of attorney to Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on behalf of Jan.
He also contended that the journalist had been “portrayed as a terrorist” in the case.
Judge Sipra remarked that the other side needed to be heard as well and issued a notice to police for November 8 on an application by Jan for the provision of case documents and adjourned the hearing until the said date.
Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who has also represented Jan in the case, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists President Afzal Butt and other journalists were also present in the court during the hearing.
At the last hearing  held yesterday, the ATC had rejected Jan’s acquittal plea.
It should be mentioned that several veteran journalists and human rights activists have demanded the immediate withdrawal of the case registered against Jan.
Jan’s arrest
According to the first information report (FIR) registered against Jan at Margalla Police Station, his car was stopped at a checkpoint in Sector E-9, where he allegedly resisted arrest, rammed his vehicle into a police barrier and snatched a rifle before being subdued.
The FIR invokes Section 9(2)4 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) for possessing 100 to 500 grams of crystal meth and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) for acts of terrorism.
Jan was arrested on the night of November 26, 2024, and initially remanded in police custody. However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had later overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody.
His defence counsels, Advocates Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha, had subsequently secured his post-arrest bail.
Meanwhile, Jan had written a letter to the Inspector General of Islamabad Police (IG), alleging abduction and torture prior to his arrest.
In the letter, Jan stated that on November 27, 2024, he and fellow journalist Saqib Bashir were abducted from the Pims Hospital parking area by men in police uniforms, blindfolded and taken to an unknown location where they were tortured and illegally detained.
He claimed that police later registered a bogus FIR at Margalla Police Station, accusing him of terrorism and drug smuggling. Jan said his colleague’s sworn affidavit before the Anti-Terrorism Court confirmed their abduction.
Jan also recalled his 2020 abduction, underscoring that such acts violated his constitutional and professional rights, as well as the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021.
He had urged the IG to appoint an honest and independent officer to investigate the case on merit.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3113110696e4800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952347/india-savours-greatest-day-after-womens-world-cup-heroics' target='_blank'><strong>India savours ‘greatest day’ after Women’s World Cup heroics</strong></a><br><p>India’s stunning World Cup semi-final win over Australia was described on Friday as the greatest day in the history of women’s cricket in the country, with Jemimah Rodrigues hailed for her “innings of a lifetime”.
Batter Rodrigues hit an unbeaten 127 as the hosts chased down a record 339 in Mumbai on Thursday to oust reigning seven-time champions Australia in Mumbai.
India face South Africa in the final at the same venue on Sunday as both teams attempt to win the one-day tournament for the first time in its 52-year history.
Amanjot Kaur hit the winning boundary to take India into their third final of an ODI World Cup, triggering emotional scenes.
The 25-year-old Rodrigues sank to her knees in tears while her teammates rushed to celebrate the sensational upset.
“This is the greatest day in the history of Indian women’s cricket,” veteran commentator Harsha Bhogle said on X.
 






Virat Kohli, the star batsman from the men’s team, called Rodrigues’s display the “standout performance”.
“A true display of resilience, belief and passion,” he said on social media.
 






Former men’s captain Sunil Gavaskar called the victory “exhilarating” and “absolutely thrilling”, especially because they were clear underdogs.
“They’d lost to three big guns in the tournament and then to come back the way they have just tells you the determination of this team,” the batting great said on TV channel India Today.
“So clearly you can say that the Indian women’s team has definitely come of age.”
India lost three successive matches in the league phase before clinching the last semi-final spot, in contrast to Australia’s unbeaten run into the final four.
India were in trouble at 59-2 in reply to Australia’s massive 338 when Rodrigues turned the game on its head in a 167-run third-wicket partnership with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who hit 89.
Rodrigues, a middle-order batter who had a modest start in the tournament and was dropped in the league game against England, was promoted to number three and delivered when it mattered.
“When you are left and then come back into the team the pressure is way too high… today’s innings was a marvellous innings,” said Gavaskar.
That was echoed by former national cricketer Mohammad Kaif, who called it an “innings of a lifetime”.
“Fantastic to watch free-flowing cricket by Jemimah Rodrigues,” he said on X.
“In and out from the team but she never stopped believing.” India have twice been runners-up, in 2005 and 2017.
In 2017 they beat Australia in the semi-finals before losing to England.
Rodrigues opens up on mental health battle
Facing the pressure of playing in a World Cup on home soil, Rodrigues struggled for consistence, posting two ducks and a pair of 30s before being dropped for India’s group-stage match against England.
She said she often broke down in calls to her parents as she tried to cope with the pressure.
“I am so blessed to have friends, I can call family, I didn’t have to go through it alone. And it’s okay to ask for help,” Rodrigues said.
“I will be very vulnerable here because I know if someone is watching, this might be going through the same thing. Nobody likes to talk about their weakness,” she added, holding back tears.
“I was going through a lot of anxiety and when you are going through anxiety,
you just feel numb. You don’t know what to do. You are trying to be yourself. And in this time, my mum and dad supported me a lot.
“When you are dropped, you have a lot of doubts because I always want to contribute to the team. That really hit me … But sometimes all you need to do is, just hang in there and, things fall into place.”
A composed 76 not out against New Zealand helped restore her confidence and set the stage for her semi-final heroics against seven-times champions Australia.
Rodrigues said she had only one thought in mind when she went out to bat.
“All I would say was I didn’t play for my 100. I didn’t play to prove a point at number three,” she said. “I just played to make sure India win. I wanted to see India win at the end and that was my only motivation.”

Banks, many damaged or destroyed along with homes, schools and other institutions across Gaza during two years of onslaught, began reopening on October 16, six days after the ceasefire was announced. Queues soon formed but people came away disappointed.
“There is no money, liquidity at the bank,” said father-of-six Wael Abu Fares, 61, standing outside the Bank of Palestine. “You just come and do paperwork transactions and leave.”
People need cash for most everyday transactions in Gaza, whether to buy food in the market or pay utility bills, but Israel blocked transfers of banknotes along with most other goods following the attack and mass hostage-taking by Hamas in October 2023.

Huge fees to cash salaries
“Banks are open, air conditioning is on, but they are mostly doing electronic business, no deposits, no withdrawals of cash,” Gaza economist Mohammad Abu Jayyab told Reuters. “People go to some greedy merchants to cash their salaries and they give them cash for a huge fee, which ranges between 20 per cent and sometimes goes to 40pc.”
Mother-of-seven Iman al-Ja’bari longs for a time when transactions at banks used to take less than an hour.
“You need two or three days to go back and forth, back and forth, spending your whole life standing there,” she said. “And in the end, you only get 400 or 500 shekels ($123 or $153). What can this (amount) buy with the incredibly high prices today that we can’t afford?”

For a few Palestinians, the cash crunch has provided an opportunity to eke out a living. Manal al-Saidi, 40, repairs damaged banknotes to cover some basic needs.
“I work and I make 20, 30 shekels ($6, $9), and I leave with a loaf of bread, beans for dinner, falafel, anything, something simple,” she said, wiping notes. “Not that I can get (afford) vegetables or anything, no, just enough to get by.”
Some people use electronic transfers through bank apps for even small items such as eggs or sugar, but the sellers apply additional fees.
The issue of cash supplies into Gaza was not included in US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, which also left the details of reconstruction and security to be decided.
COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into the Gaza Strip, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether or when banknotes may be allowed back in.

The shortage of notes and coins has compounded the crisis for Gazans who have lost relatives, jobs and homes, used up their savings and sold their possessions to buy food, tents and medications. Some are relying on barter to get by.
Palestinian merchant Samir Namrouti, 53, has got used to banknotes that are almost unrecognisable through overuse.
“What matters to me is its serial number. As long as its serial number is there, that’s it, I treat it as money,” he said.

In a statement, the FO said Dar received a call the previous evening from Anand.
“The two leaders discussed strengthening bilateral trade and investment, including sectors such as agriculture and mines and minerals, and collaboration under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPPA),” the FO said.
 
 

It added that the Canadian foreign minister thanked Dar for facilitating market access for imports of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
“Both leaders appreciated recent constructive engagements, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing mutually beneficial economic cooperation,” the FO said, adding that the two foreign ministers agreed to remain in close contact.
 






Anand also commented on her phone call with Dar in a post on social media platform X.
“We discussed a range of issues including opening up Pakistan to imports of Canadian canola, the FIPPA model, and bilateral economic engagement,” she said.
She also thanked Dar for “productive meetings” over the past few months in Kuala Lumpur and New York as well as the phone call.
 






Pakistan’s imports from Canada mostly include pulses and canola seeds.
During the last fiscal year, Pakistan’s merchandise exports to North America grew by 9.97 per cent in FY25, reaching $6.415bn compared to $5.833bn in the previous year. Data compiled by the central bank attributed the rebound to increased exports of textiles and clothing to the US, which accounted for nearly 94pc of Pakistan’s total exports to the region; the remaining share was primarily directed towards Canada.</p><small>2025-10-31 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31115116983f908.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952343/mobile-internet-services-suspended-in-quetta-today-for-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet services suspended in Quetta today for 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government has suspended mobile data services in Quetta district today for 24 hours due to the law and order situation, it emerged on Friday.
In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Interior and dated October 30 — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — the Balochistan government requested that the relevant authorities be directed to suspend 3G/4G internet services in Quetta on October 31 (today) for 24 hours.
“Owing to the peculiar law and order situation and threat perceptions, the services of 3G and 4G services are required to be jammed in district Quetta,” the missive said.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
The suspension also comes only two months after mobile data services in the province were suspended in August over “security reasons”. However, on August 21— 16 days into the suspension — the Balochistan High Court (BHC) had ordered the immediate restoration of mobile internet services, leading to the resumption of connectivity in the province.
According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year.
Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.</p><small>2025-10-31 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3023453230744a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952185/plot-to-target-dawn-tv-journalist-foiled-3-suspects-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Plot to target Dawn TV journalist foiled; 3 suspects arrested</strong></a><br><p>The attempted target killing of a DawnNewsTV journalist was foiled following the arrest of the suspects by the police, confirmed the investigating officer (IO) of the case on Thursday.
Sub Inspector Nabeel Haider said that three suspects had been hired to kill journalist Tahir Naseer, based in Rawalpindi, for Rs200,000.
“They (the suspects) surveilled Naseer’s house for three days,” the IO said, adding that they had also received Rs99,000 in their bank account and that one of the suspects procured weapons.“
 
 

“Police arrested the three suspects and seized their vehicle and weapons from near Naseer’s house,” the IO added. “They were produced before the district magistrate, who rejected the request for physical remand and sent the suspects to jail on judicial remand instead.”
In a first information (FIR) report filed on Wednesday under Section 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Naseer said that around 4pm, he received a phone call from his cousin saying that suspicious people were asking about him at a local baker.
“When I arrived at the tandoor, I saw a white car with three young men,” Naseer stated in the FIR. “My cousin told me that they had been asking about me and showing my picture. While they were asking around, they said their names were Ahmed, Akash and Vishal.”
The journalist stated in the FIR that the apparent reason for the attempt on his life was a vlog he published earlier about a private company and later also reported on DawnNewsTV on the same subject.
“I filed a case against them (company owners) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and the PPC,” he stated. “They then began threatening me over WhatsApp through international numbers,” added the journalist.
Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-10-31 06:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31102032f41000e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952338/us-signs-10-year-defence-pact-with-india-hegseth-says' target='_blank'><strong>US signs 10-year defence pact with India, Hegseth says</strong></a><br><p>The United States has signed a 10-year defence framework agreement with India, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday.
The framework is considered a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence, enhancing coordination, information sharing and technological cooperation between the two nations, Hegseth posted on X after a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh.
“Our defence ties have never been stronger,” Hesgeth added.
 






According to Hindustan Times, the meeting took place on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to begin from tomorrow.
After signing the framework, Hegseth expressed gratitude to Singh for the partnership between Washington and New Delhi, the publication said.
“It’s one of those consequential US-India relationships in the world. Our strategic alignment is built on shared interests, on mutual trust and commitment to a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region,” the report quoted him as saying.
According to the report, Hegseth described the 10-year defence framework as “ambitious” and said it marked a critical step for the militaries of both countries, laying down a “roadmap for deeper and even more meaningful collaboration ahead”.
“It underscores America’s long-term commitment for our shared security and our strong partnership,” he said.
The development comes days after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Malaysia — the highest-level contact since the US imposed sanctions last week on Russian oil companies, a key source of India’s crude supplies.
Jaishankar posted a photograph on social media showing him smiling and shaking hands with Rubio, saying he “appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues”.
Few details were released, but Jaishankar posted a photograph on social media showing him smiling and shaking hands with Rubio, saying he “appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues”.
 






Relations between Washington and New Delhi had plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
Trump, who spoke to Modi last week by telephone, has claimed that the Indian leader has agreed to cut Russian oil imports — something New Delhi has not commented on.
Last month, the US also added a “one-time” $100,000 fee to H-1B skilled worker visas, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the annual recipients. India had said the Trump administration’s move was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.</p><small>2025-10-31 05:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3110302862dc5b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952339/us-ends-automatic-extension-of-work-permits' target='_blank'><strong>US ends automatic extension of work permits</strong></a><br><p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued an interim final rule that eliminates the automatic extension of work permits or Employment Authorisation Documents (EADs).
The new rule applies to renewal applications filed on or after October 30, and several categories of foreign nationals, including H-4 visa holders and spouses of certain categories of H-1B visa holders.
 
 

In a statement released to the media on Thursday, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recommended that “aliens seek a timely renewal of their EAD by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires”.
The agency warned that “the longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorisation or documentation”.
The development is linked to several recent moves aimed at limiting both legal and illegal migration to the United States. It includes a $100,000 one-time fee on new H-1B petitions for skilled workers, which became effective on September 21.
Under the new rule, foreign nationals who submit a renewal application for their employment authorisation on or after October 30 will no longer automatically receive an extension of their existing work permit simply by virtue of a timely-filed application.
Previous policy allowed certain eligible applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiry of their EADs while the renewal was pending, provided that they timely filed their applications.
The new rule abolishes that automatic extension in nearly all categories, so that once the current authorisation expires, work must cease unless a new authorisation is issued or some other basis to continue work exists.
The rule, however, does not apply retroactively: renewals filed before October 30 remain eligible for the automatic extension under earlier rules.
The DHS states there are limited exceptions — for example, certain extensions provided by law or via Federal Register notice may continue to be eligible for an automatic extension.
“With this rule, DHS prioritises the proper screening and vetting of aliens before extending the validity of their employment authorisations,” the official announcement added.
The DHS said ending automatic extensions of EADs “results in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for employment authorisation to work in the US. Reviewing an alien’s background more often will enable [USCIS] to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US.”
“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritised aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow.</p><small>2025-10-31 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31090924594d351.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952265/charles-strips-andrew-of-titles-and-mansion' target='_blank'><strong>Charles strips Andrew of titles and mansion</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: Britain’s King Charles has stripped his younger brother Andrew of his title of prince and forced him out of his home by Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday, punishing him over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew, 65, the younger brother of Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has come under mounting pressure over his behaviour and ties to Epstein and earlier this month he was forced to stop using his title of Duke of York.
 
 

Charles has now escalated his actions against Andrew by stripping him of his titles, leaving him to be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.
The Buckingham Palace statement said a formal notice had now also been served on Andrew to surrender the lease of his Royal Lodge mansion on the Windsor Estate, west of London, and he will move to alternative private accommodation in eastern England.
“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”
A palace source said that while Andrew continued to deny the accusations against him, it was clear that there had been serious lapses of judgement. The source said the decision was taken by Charles, but that the monarch had the support of the wider family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince William.

• AJK planning department suspends release of development funds
ISLAMABAD: After days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday endorsed the plan for in-house change in Azad Kashmir in a meeting attended by senior PPP and PML-N leadership at the Presidency.
Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. A source describing the meeting as the final round of consultations over the upcoming no-trust motion termed it “very positive”. He said both sides called for political stability in Azad Kashmir and criticised the incumbent AJK government for the manner in which it handled recent protests in the state.
A member of the AJK Assembly, when asked if the PML-N would vote for the no-confidence motion against Anwar ul Haq as well as for the PPP nominee, said that “they will be automatically voting for the PPP candidate when they vote against Haq, as the successor’s name will be there on the resolution to be passed”.
It may be noted here that it is mandatory under the interim constitution to summon the session of the Legislative Assembly within 14 days of the submission of the resolution for a vote of no-confidence. The resolution has to be signed by at least 14 members of the House.
Under the law, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence cannot be moved in the assembly unless, by the same resolution, the name of another member of the assembly is put forward as the successor. “A resolution shall not be voted upon before the expiration of three days, or later than seven days, from the date on which it is moved in the assembly,” the law reads.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act 1974 provides that when a no-confidence motion is passed in the house, the successor proposed in the resolution becomes the next prime minister without any separate election procedure.
Meanwhile, incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can. A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.
Moreover, the Planning and Develo­pment Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has suspended the release of funds to the tune of billions sanctioned for different line departments for development projects under the annual development programme for the first half of the current financial year 2025-26.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, proposed clearance of Rs 3,721.259 million in “mature liabilities” in various sectors like communication, agriculture, education, health, etc. A formal notification barred the release of further funds for any development scheme without written approval. Huge funds amounting to well over seven billion, however, have already been released to different departments.

According to the FIA, three private banks, two cement factories, and one chemical company were the beneficiaries of these refunds. The agency alleged that these entities were clients of Mr Zaidi’s private audit and consultancy firm prior to his appointment as FBR chairman, raising concerns of conflict of interest.

Even small disruptions at critical moments can hurt Pakistan’s agriculture sector as Islamabad lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations, says the report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) — a Sydney-based independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank dedicated to shifting the world’s focus to peace as a positive, achievable and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.
The report warns that Pakistan’s dam capacity can hold only about 30 days of Indus flow and any prolonged cut will be disastrous if not managed.
However, at present, India’s ability to “turn off” the flow of rivers is constrained by its infrastructure.

Ecological Threat Report warns even small disruptions can hurt country’s farm sector in near term; says Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations

“All of India’s dams on the weste­rn rivers are run-of-the-river proje­cts with minimal storage,” the report says.
 
 

While the implications are unclear, the rising tensions in South Asia and the Middle East are potentially linked to the future of water diplomacy for the Indus.
“For Pakistan, the danger is acute. If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons. Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers,” the report reads.
Foreign involvement
The report says that following the signing of the defence treaty betw­een Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the kingdom will most likely support Isl­­amabad in any conflict with India.
“This is likely to be supportive of the continuation of the Indus agreement as India is more likely to think carefully before creating a pretext for war.”
If the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) unravels, the involvement of other players like China or even Afgha­n­is­­tan can further complicate matters.
“For now, the IWT remains officially bilateral, but the 2025 episode showed that global powers have a stake in preventing water conflicts,” warns the report.
Internationally, India’s suspension of the IWT raised concerns about setting a precedent.
China, a close ally of Pakistan and an upstream riparian, also took interest in the affair.
In May this year, China’s state media announced an acceleration of the Mohmand Dam project in Pakistan — a hydropower initiative financed by Beijing — framing it as a gesture of support to Islamabad in the face of India’s water “threats”.
The implication was clear: China signalled solidarity with Pakistan, effectively cautioning India against pushing Islamabad too far on water.
For the first time, India began operating its dams outside the treaty constraints.
‘Reservoir flushing’
In May, Indian authorities carried out “reservoir flushing” on the Chenab River’s Salal and Baglihar dams without notifying Pakistan.
This operation, which involves emptying reservoirs to flush out silt, had been forbidden under the treaty (or at least tightly regulated) because it causes sudden downstream flow changes.
India proceeded unilaterally, aiming to boost its dams’ storage and power generation capacity now that it considered itself unbound by IWT limits.
The immediate impact was dramatic: sections of the Chenab in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for a few days, as India’s dam gates were shut, then released sediment-laden torrents when opened.
The IWT between India and Pakistan has acted as a core conflict resolution tool and point of cooperation for 60 years.
India’s suspension of the treaty this year marks a period of heighten­­ed tension between the two countries.
There was no armed conflict over water in these instances. In fact, the IWT often served as a safety valve, providing legal and diplomatic processes to address grievances that might otherwise provoke unilateral retaliation.
“However, these arbitrated conflicts have accumulated over time to reduce trust even as cooperation continued,” the IEP says in its report.

• 90pc of flood assessment survey completed; data of 463,000 victims verified by deputy commissioners
BAHAWALPUR: The Punjab government has distributed Rs6.39 billion among flood-affected people across the province. The amount is part of the Rs100bn allocation made under the Punjab Chief Minister Flood Rehabilitation Programme.
Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb made the announcement while addressing a ceremony to distribute ATM cards among the flood-hit people at Jinnah Stadium, Khairpur Tamewali, about 45km from here, on Thursday.
She said 90 per cent of the flood assessment survey, covering data of 569,000 victims, had been completed by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). Data of 463,000 victims had also been verified by the respective deputy commissioners to ensure transparency in the compensation disbursement process.
According to an official statement issued from Lahore, authorities told a meeting that over 98,000 ATM cards had been prepared, while 37 camp sites had been set up in 27 flood-affected districts across Punjab for compensation payments through the Bank of Punjab. Each beneficiary will receive Rs50,000 in cash along with an ATM card.
The distribution of compensation in 13 districts began on Oct 20, while disbursement in the remaining districts will start in the second phase from Nov 3.
Each flood victim can withdraw up to Rs300,000 per day from Bank of Punjab ATMs. According to the statement, 19 camps have been established for flood victims in 36 tehsils, with Rs50,000 in cash and ATM cards to be issued to 500 people at each camp.
Flood rehabilitation camps have also been set up in Bahawalnagar, Depalpur, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Muzaffargarh, Chiniot and Khairpur Tamewali.
Provincial ministers Mian Kazim Hussain Pirzada, Khwaja Salman Rafique, Malik Sohaib Ahmed Berth, MPA Rana Tariq, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen, Bahawalpur Deputy Commissioner Dr Farhan Farooq, and former senator Saood Majid Chaudhry accompanied Ms Aurangzeb at the ceremony.
The senior minister said Rs20bn had been transferred to the Bank of Punjab for the rehabilitation of flood-affected people, of which Rs11bn had been credited to victims’ accounts.
She said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would continue to stand by the flood survivors until their complete rehabilitation, noting that the process had begun within a record 26 days.
Ms Aurangzeb added that the survey in 72 tehsils of the flood-affected districts had already been completed, despite earlier claims that it would take six months. Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada also addressed the ceremony.

• Dispute between senior lawyers over list of who gets to meet Imran in Adiala leaves many within the party red-faced
LAHORE: Mere weeks after incarcerated founder Imr­an Khan warned party leaders against airing their dirty laundry in public, ano­ther tiff — this time over the leadership of PTI in central Punjab — has erupted over the social media platform X, in full public view.
In a telling series of tweets on Thursday, Secretary Gene­ral Salman Akram Raja railed against those who were “conspiring against him”, and recalled that Mr Khan had personally tasked him with conveying messages from Adiala jail.
 






Although he didn’t explain the issue at hand, a cursory glance at his earlier tweets and messages posted by other PTI leaders laid bare the dispute.
The controversy centres around the ouster of PTI Cen­tral Punjab President Ahmad Chattha and Gene­ral Secre­tary Bilal Ejaz, who were remo­ved on instructions supposedly conveyed by Imran Khan on Oct 16, when he met Barr­ister Gohar Ali Khan and Salman Akram Raja in Adiala jail.
Mr Chattha was one of the men shot and injured in Wazirabad when Imran Khan’s container was fired upon during a rally in 2022.
A notification, issued on the same day by PTI’s Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza, had announced Mr Chattha’s removal. He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich.
 

Aliya Hamza

Following the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting.
In a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison.
 






Speaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president.
In a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab.
But the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison.
“I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday.
 






Diving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her.
 






Ms Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman.
When approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal.
Some went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell.
When approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role.
List dispute
 

Salman Akram Raja

Another dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail.
It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists.
However, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar.
In another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer.
However, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”.
 






Party leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).
