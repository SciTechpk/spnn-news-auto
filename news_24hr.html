One teacher’s legacy shows a better way</strong></a><br><p>I first came to know Aunty Sonnu in the twilight of the Zia years, through my friendship with her youngest daughter, Laila Rahman. What began as her good-humoured acceptance of a young outsider in her home, gradually deepened into a bond of genuine connection, moored in three common passions: a profound love for Laila, her youngest, most passionate and creative child; a deep attachment to Lahore; and an enduring affection for Government College — the institution that shaped so much of who she became.
After Laila and I wed, that bond grew into a shared life. Together, we weathered seasons of joy and passages of grief, during which I came to understand the many worlds she gracefully inhabited. She was Babijan to her husband’s family in Mardan, Aunty Sonnu or Sonnu Khala to friends and relatives, and Mrs. Rahman to the generations of students she guided and mentored.
Sohni Sondhi was born, raised, and educated at Government College, where her father, Professor G.D. Sondhi, taught. It was within those familiar halls that she met Abdul Rahman Khan and entered into a bond so profound that she embraced Islam and left her beloved Lahore to marry him, making a new home in his ancestral town of Mardan.
There, she found belonging, forming lasting ties with both family and community. She became fluent in Pashto, bridging a language divide that still fragments our communities today. Through all these years, she remained a voracious reader and gifted storyteller — a passion she passed on to her children, her grandchildren, and to the many young people she encountered.
While much is being written about the many journeys that defined her life, I wish to reflect on Mrs Rahman, the educator. The truest way to honour her, I believe, is to pause and ask what her life reveals about the mission of education in Pakistan; a cause she served with rare distinction.
When questions mattered more than answers
To grasp the scale of her impact on generations of young people, we must first return to her own educational beginnings at Government College Lahore in the mid-twentieth century. At the time, the College was more than an academic institution — it was a bastion of the humanist tradition, dedicated to preparing its students for the responsibilities of civic life.
Its mission extended beyond the narrow confines of disciplinary instruction, insisting instead on the cultivation of eloquent speech and writing, the practice of persuasive and reasoned argument, and the habits of critical and creative thought. Students were trained not only as specialists in their fields but also in the arts of debate, literature, and performance, with a special emphasis on drama.
The humanist tradition came alive through pioneering teachers like A. S. Bokhari, Sufi Tabassum, Thapar, Sirajuddin, Verma, Latif, Chawla, Kashyap, and G. D. Sondhi. They believed education was not about cramming facts but about sparking ideas. Their classrooms buzzed with debate, where students learned to think independently and creatively and teachers welcomed being challenged in turn.
Their pursuit was never about teaching to the test; it was its outright rejection, a refusal to reduce education to rote drills and mechanical instruction. Instead, they fought to nurture curiosity, imagination, and the courage to question and create: the very qualities that exam-driven schooling, with its drills and memorisation, so often drains from young minds.
They also instilled in their students the value of tolerance. The College’s student body, though drawn largely from the elite, was a blend of ethnicities, sects, and faiths. Within its classrooms, differences were respected and coexistence was treated as a principle to be embodied rather than preached. They offered a striking counterpoint to the narrow and exclusionary forces that, then as now, work to fracture our society.
A legacy written in minds, not titles
Mrs Rahman realized the very spirit of this tradition, never more alive than when she was with her students. Although she took up teaching at the age of 60, for her it was never a job, it was a vocation. She taught history, not as a set of dates and facts but as a living story of how societies evolve and how those shifts have shaped human lives.
Beyond the classroom, she was an avid explorer travelling to historic sites, wandering through museums, and seeking out conversations with scholars and fellow travellers. What she discovered, she carried back to her classroom —  every journey fed her passion for teaching and became a story to share. In this way, she gave her students more than lessons; she gave them a sense of wonder.
The classroom was her canvas, and her students the co-creators. Her vitality and love of learning made her not just a devoted teacher, but an unforgettable one. She embodied the very curiosity, wit, and spirit of tolerance and coexistence that she sought to awaken in her students.
Her education in the humanist tradition at Government College paved the way for this vision. It gave her a lifelong resolve to transcend the boundaries of narrow disciplinary instruction, putting language, argument, and the art of critical thought at the heart of education.
As a founding faculty member of the Lahore College of Arts and Sciences (LACAS), she spearheaded the revival of debates and theatre at the school level — a bold undertaking during Zia’s authoritarian era, when censorship stifled expression and the humanities languished in once-vibrant institutions like Government College.
At LACAS, she helped equip students from diverse backgrounds with the tools of creative and critical thought. Her efforts culminated in the revival of debating at the national level, nurturing a new generation of students who went on to distinguish themselves in remarkable ways. And she did it all from the ground up, through unrelenting effort within the strictures of the system.
The outpouring of messages from her former students and mentees till date, stands as a quiet testament to those efforts. She changed lives, without holding high office or title in the education system, but through sheer passion for learning and kindling in others the joy of questioning, discovery, and expression.
How learning has become an atomised enterprise
Yet, ironically, instead of building on such examples, much of the global education system has moved in the opposite direction. It has become increasingly grade-obsessed, killing the desire to learn and narrowing horizons at the expense of the broader critical skills essential for civic life. Teachers are reduced to functionaries, bound to pre-set rubrics, stripped of the autonomy to shape learning.
The rise of exam-driven academies and limited subject choices have left scant space for the study of languages, rhetoric, and the art of critical and creative thought. In the process, education has been hollowed into an atomised enterprise — alienating both teachers and students from the pursuit of knowledge, and producing citizens deprived of the very skills needed to question, to challenge, and to imagine alternatives.
What Mrs Rahman’s legacy as an educator makes clear is that Pakistan’s much-touted rise as a “knowledge economy” will remain an empty claim unless we build a culture that truly empowers teachers who value the enterprise of learning and the production of knowledge. Education must prepare the young to question, to create, and to step confidently into public life.
Seen against this backdrop, Mrs Rahman’s example shines all the more brightly: she embodied a humanist tradition, and through her life and work, offers a living reminder of what education in Pakistan could, and should, be.</p><small>2025-09-12 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/121311223805b29.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941439/words-presented-out-of-context-ihc-cj-clarifies-exchange-with-imaan-mazari' target='_blank'><strong>‘Words presented out of context’: IHC CJ clarifies exchange with Imaan Mazari</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar provided a clarification on Friday regarding his reported remarks during an exchange he had with renowned rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir the previous day, saying that his words were presented “out of context”.
The exchange took place during the hearing of a plea for the removal of rights activist Mahrang Baloch’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL), where Justice Dogar warned Mazari of contempt of court proceedings for allegedly calling him a “dictator”.
The matter came up again today during the hearing of another case on a plea filed by a citizen named Abdul Jabbar, who also sought the removal of his name from the ECL.
Addressing it, Justice Dogar said Mazari was “just like a daughter” to him, and he was just explaining things to her yesterday.
“Being the chief justice and an elder, I was trying to make her understand.”
He went on to say that his remarks were presented out of context and “a storm brewed up”.
The IHC CJ maintained that during his exchange with Mazari, he had told her that she could disagree with his decisions, but she should have avoided making her criticism personal.
At one point, he reiterated: “I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights?”
Moreover, it has been reported that during yesterday’s exchange, Justice Dogar also addressed Mazari’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
However, he clarified today that he did not say anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari.
“I did not say that I will get hold of her, [but] this [reported remark] is being circulated since yesterday. Hadi sahib was standing [there], so I asked him to take her away or I would initiate contempt of court proceedings.”
Later, Chattha maintained in a post on X that the judge had in fact made the reported remarks.
 






He accused the judge of lying and misconduct before referring to Justice’s Dogar remarks from today’s hearing.
The IHC CJ said during today’s hearing that in case of contempt of court proceedings, Mazari’s career would suffer.
Reacting to that, Chattha said Justice Dogar was “not eligible to hold judicial office” and that he had held “the entire high court hostage”.
Condemnations
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, posted on X after yesterday’s hearing that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She added that Mahrang Baloch’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
After Justice Dogar’s clarification today, she again criticised him on X for making “sexist” remarks and accused him of harassing her.
“First, the chief justice misbehaved, harassed me at my workplace and threatened me openly in the court … Today again, he is passing sexist remarks.”
She asserted that she was neither his daughter nor a child. “I am a professional lawyer”.
 






Later, she also thanked the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) for condemning the IHC CJ’s remarks in statement. Sharing the statement on X, she expressed the opinion that Justice Dogar was “not fit to be a judge”.
 






The LHCBA statement said the body’s president, vice president and secretary “strongly condemn” Justice Dogar’s exchange with Mazari.
The statement said that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity was to be prioritised just as those of respected judges who were working within the bounds of law and the Constitution.
It added that Justice Dogar’s “dictatorial behaviour is a gross violation of the judge’s code of conduct and it is immensely important to keep any such judge away from court proceedings”.
The LHCBA urged the Supreme Judicial Council — the highest forum responsible for disciplinary proceedings against judges of the superior judiciary — to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
Separately, a group of female lawyers also became signatories to a condemnation of Justice Dogar’s remarks, terming them “sexist, threatening and unbecoming of a judge”.
The condemnatory statement said Justice Dogar’s remarks “reflect a deeply patriarchal attitude, and the threats are a source of concern. The purpose of contempt laws is to uphold the administration of justice, not for judges to hold a sword over the head of lawyers”.
 






The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also issued a statement saying that it “strongly condemns the highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
“The association notes with deep concern that instead of maintaining judicial dignity and impartiality, the chief justice resorted to derogatory remarks and threats of contempt proceedings against the counsel. Such behaviour undermines the sanctity of judicial forums, intimidates members of the bar and is contrary to principles of justice,” the statement read.
It emphasised that lawyers had the right to represent their clients “without fear or harassment, and any attempt to suppress this right cannot be tolerated”.
Expressing solidarity with Mazari, the KBA urged the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Supreme Court and Pakistan Bar Council to take notice of the incident.
“The judiciary must remain above personal remarks and coercive conduct; respect between bar and bench must always be mutual to protect the integrity of our justice system,” the KBA stressed.

The FIA is a border control agency which plays an important role in preventing illegal immigration and human trafficking. Its crackdown on human smugglers intensified following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year.
During a visit to the FIA Headquarters in Islamabad, the delegation was welcomed by FIA Additional Director General Jan Muhammad and received a “comprehensive” briefing on Pakistan’s border management practices.
The head of the Iraqi delegation “reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation between the border management agencies of both countries,” the press release noted.
 






The briefing included an overview of FIA’s mandate and the work of FIA’s specialised units. “At the Risk Analysis Unit (RAU), the director [of] immigration explained how intelligence-led risk management is being applied to identify and mitigate threats at Pakistan’s borders,” it read.
The delegation visited the forensic laboratory, where the “lab’s crucial role in verifying travel documents, detecting forgery, and supporting litigation in travel-related offences” was highlighted. It also visited the Islamabad International Airport to “witness first-hand the enhancements made under FIA’s next-generation border control systems”.
The delegation was given a detailed briefing on the role of FIA Academy in the capacity building of its personnel and on the operations of the Second Line Border Control in detecting fraudulent travel documents and supporting front-line officers.
The visit was facilitated by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) under the framework of a Danish-funded Rights-Based Border Management project, the press release said.
Earlier this week, the FIA arrested 14 suspects, inc­luding four Iranian nationals, in Balochistan during separate operations targeting human smuggling networks.
In January, 65 FIA officials were blacklisted for posting at any immigration checkpost and anti-human trafficking circles in the country after an inquiry into the Greece boat tragedy.</p><small>2025-09-12 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12154649f8d61fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941458/pakistan-to-host-next-sco-summit-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to host next SCO summit: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced that Pakistan will host the next Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, stating that authorities need to start preparing.

PM Shehbaz added that the railways and interior ministries are working on a rail project which will connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

The decision comes as the country is facing catastrophic floods, which have inundated thousands of villages and displaced millions in Punjab, with flood water now expected to move downstream towards Sindh.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health, “After holding discussions with relevant representatives from all four provinces, AJK (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) and Gilgit-Baltistan, on the instructions of Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, the PMDC has revised the exam date to October 26 (Sunday).”
The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
The decision was taken in light of the “difficulties faced by students in the affected areas,“ the statement read.
The exam was previously scheduled to be held on October 5.
The “decision is in the larger interest of the students,” the statement quoted Health Minister Mustafa Kamal as saying.
“The government is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to every student in the country,” he added.
The exam, which in previous years has been marred by delays, is the entry requirement for admission to medical and dental colleges across Pakistan.
Each year, approximately 200,000 candidates take the MDCAT.
This year, the exam will conducted in the following universities across the country: University of Health Sciences, Lahore in Punjab; Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur for Sindh; Khyber Medical University, Peshawar for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Bolan University of Medical and Health Sciences, Quetta for Balochistan; and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad for Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan as well as PMDC’s international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-09-12 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623321-karachi-court-remands-man-suspected-of-assaulting-minor-girls-to-police-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Man suspected of sexually assaulting minor girls in Karachi sent on 5-day physical remand</strong></a><br><p>

The Himalayan nation of 30 million people was plunged into chaos this week after security forces tried to crush rallies by young anti-corruption protesters, culminating in widespread violence on Tuesday. At least 51 people were killed in the worst violence since the end of a Maoist civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.
The military took back control of the streets on Wednesday, enforcing a curfew, as army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Ramchandra Paudel held talks with key figures and representatives from “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
‘Solution being sought’
Disagreements between rival factions remain, although Sushila Karki, 73, Nepal’s first woman chief justice, is a leading candidate.
“A meeting has been scheduled for this afternoon with the president, the army chief, former chief justice Sushila Karki, our representative Sudan Gurung and one legal expert,” Nimesh Shrestha, who was part of the Gen Z protest, told AFP.
Karki has told AFP that “experts need to come together to figure out the way forward”, and that “the parliament still stands”.
 


Gurung, the youth activist, told reporters on Thursday that their “first demand is the dissolution of parliament”.
Paudel issued a statement to the nation on Thursday saying that “a solution to the problem is being sought, as soon as possible”.
The army patrolled the largely quiet streets of the capital, Kathmandu, for a third day on Friday, after the protests and nationwide chaos that included a mass breakout of prisoners.
 
 

“I was very afraid and stayed locked inside my home with family and didn’t leave,” said Naveen Kumar Das, a painter-decorator in his mid-40s. He was among many ordinary residents of Kathmandu who took advantage of a brief lifting of the curfew in the morning to stock up on supplies.
Food stores, tea stalls and pharmacies bustled with customers after people spent days inside.
“It was a really tense time and we just stayed indoors,” said Laxmi Thapa, 32, on a motorbike as her husband filled its fuel tank. “We came out as things have improved.”
‘Make a better Nepal’
At least 21 protesters were among those killed, mainly on Monday during a police crackdown on demonstrations against corruption and poor governance that was sparked by a ban on social media.
Protesters set the parliament, major government buildings and a Hilton Hotel on fire on Tuesday. KP Sharma Oli, 73, resigned as prime minister, and the army then took charge of the streets.
Nepal’s army said on Friday that it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the uprising, during which protesters were seen brandishing automatic rifles.
More than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails across the country during the chaos “are still at large”, police spokesman Binod Ghimire told AFP.

Protests fed into longstanding economic woes in Nepal, where more than two-fifths of people are aged between 16 and 40. A fifth of people aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447.
Discussions are still heated among Gen Z ranks as they seek a radical political transition. James Karki, 24, who was among the protesters, said he was hopeful for change.
“We started this movement so we could make a better Nepal,” he said. “And I am positive that the army will listen. “</p><small>2025-09-12 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12112857c94ace9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941420/pakistan-israel-trade-barbs-at-unsc-over-attack-in-doha' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Israel trade barbs at UNSC over attack in Doha</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Israel engaged in a heated debate at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Thursday, with Islamabad condemning Tel Aviv’s recent attack in Qatar targeting Hamas leaders as “illegal, unprovoked, and a threat to regional stability”.
The sharp exchange took place at an emergency UNSC meeting convened under the agenda item ‘Situation in the Middle East’. The session had been requested by Algeria, Pakistan, and Somalia and was supported by France and the United Kingdom.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, opened his address at the UNSC with a strong condemnation of Israel’s strike, calling it a “brazen and illegal assault” and a violation of Qatar’s sovereignty.
“The brazen and illegal assault is not an isolated incident, rather it is part of a broader and consistent pattern of aggression and violation of international law by Israel that undermines regional peace and stability.”
Ahmad further highlighted that the “Israeli strikes targeted a residential neighbourhood, deliberately endangering civilians, and thus, also constitute a grave breach of the International Humanitarian Law.”
He described the attack as a direct challenge to diplomacy, as it targeted Qatar at a time when delicate negotiations on a Gaza peace deal were reportedly progressing toward a possible breakthrough.
“Striking the territory of a principal mediator and those directly involved in negotiations is a deliberate attempt to sabotage diplomacy, derail peace efforts, and prolong the suffering of civilians,” he said.
Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with Qatar, highlighting the recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Doha as a demonstration of Islamabad’s support for the security and sovereignty of the Gulf nation.
“The visit underscores Pakistan’s unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” he said.
He condemned Israel’s attack as a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
 


Ahmad warned that the attack was consistent with Israel’s long record of cross-border military actions in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Yemen, describing it as “yet another manifestation of [Israel’s] systematic disregard for international law, and its brazen policy of destabilising the region.”
Reading from the Security Council statement adopted earlier in the day, Ahmad highlighted the unanimous condemnation of the strikes in Doha, noting that members had expressed deep regret at the loss of civilian life, underscored the importance of de-escalation, and affirmed support for Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement also stressed the vital role Qatar continues to play in mediation efforts alongside Egypt and the United States for a ceasefire in Gaza, and called for the release of hostages and the end of the conflict in Gaza.
For his part, Israel’s ambassador initially addressed the UNSC by invoking the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to justify the strike in Doha.
“When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil. The question was why was a terrorist given shelter at all. The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas,” he said.
At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply with Ambassador Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable, indeed ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal actions and violations of international law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian organisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
Ahmad also emphasised Pakistan’s frontline role in counterterrorism.
“The international community is well aware of Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. Al Qaeda was largely decimated due to Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, and we remain committed to this collective endeavor,” he said, reinforcing that Islamabad’s position was based on facts and international law.
Following Pakistan’s response, the Israeli ambassador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
“Maybe he was offended by my words and I apologise for that, but I make sure my speeches stick to facts. And the fact is Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, and no one condemned the US for that. When other countries attack terrorists, no one condemns them either,” he said.
He added: “You cannot change the fact that 9/11 happened, and you cannot change the fact that Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan and was killed on your territory. When you criticise us — and I’m sure you will continue — think about the standards you apply to your country and the standards you apply to Israel.”
‘We will not be deterred by those who call for war’
Assistant Secretary General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, Mohamed Khaled Khiari, also briefed the Council while Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, participated under Rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly denounced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.

“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel – led by bloodthirsty extremists – has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals. Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”
Al-Thani criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s justification of the attack, contrasting it against the Taliban’s political bureau in Doha, which facilitated the US-Taliban talks that ended the war in Afghanistan.
“The United States has never targeted the negotiators.”
He warned that Israel’s actions were destabilising the region and undermining prospects for peace.
“We call for peace, not war, and we will not be deterred by those who call for war and destruction,” he concluded.
The Security Council also heard from Rosemary DiCarlo, the under secretary general for political and peace building affairs at the UN, who described the strike in Doha as an “alarming escalation” that violated Qatar’s sovereignty and endangered the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations with respect to the Gaza invasion.
 
 

She detailed that the airstrike targeted a residential area housing Hamas’ political leadership, killing several affiliates along with a Qatari security officer.
“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of any country, including Qatar — a valued partner in advancing peacemaking and conflict resolution — must be respected,” DiCarlo told the ambassadors. Israel, she noted, claimed responsibility, with PM Netanyahu describing it as “a wholly independent operation” following a deadly attack on civilians in Jerusalem on Monday, which Hamas said it carried out.
She also noted that Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the League of Arab States, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had all condemned the action and expressed concern over further escalation, underlining the widespread international alarm over the strike.
China’s representative also highlighted the Israeli attack’s impact on ongoing diplomacy, recalling that the US had proposed a ceasefire on September 7, which Israel reportedly agreed to. Just two days later, a Hamas delegation discussing the proposal was struck by Israel. “Such an act of bad faith, irresponsibility and a deliberate sabotage of negotiations is indeed despicable,” he said, expressing concern that the attack could escalate tensions further in the region.
Other major powers also weighed in.
The US underscored that unilateral bombing inside Qatar did not serve the interests of Israel or Washington, while reaffirming support for ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and hostage negotiations. France condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of the international law and stressed the need for a political solution based on a two-State framework. The UK described the attacks as counterproductive to peace and Israel’s long-term security. Algeria and Somalia criticised Israel’s aggression and urged the Security Council to take action to prevent further destabilisation.
An illustration of deep divisions
The debate illustrated deep divisions within the Security Council over the Doha strike, with Pakistan leading the charge in condemning Israel and defending the principles of international law. Ahmad repeatedly underscored the link between Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories and recurring crises in the region, stating that durable peace could only be achieved through a comprehensive political settlement, including an end to the occupation.
Observers noted that Pakistan’s approach combined strong condemnation with legal and diplomatic reasoning, highlighting both the humanitarian consequences of the strikes and the broader threat to regional stability. Ahmad also emphasised that attacks on Qatar, a principal mediator in Gaza negotiations, constituted not just a violation of sovereignty but an attack on diplomacy itself.
By the end of the session, the UNSC collectively reaffirmed the importance of mediation, the release of hostages, and the need for a political solution to the Gaza conflict. However, the exchanges between Pakistan and Israel, coupled with Qatar and China’s condemnations, highlighted persistent tensions over accountability, the interpretation of international law, and perceived double standards in responses to acts of state violence.
The Doha strike and the ensuing Security Council debate have raised critical questions about the effectiveness of international mechanisms in restraining unilateral military actions, protecting mediators, and ensuring civilian safety in conflict zones.
For Pakistan, the session provided a platform to assert its principled stance on international law, uphold Qatar’s mediation role, and highlight the importance of accountability for actions that threaten regional peace and security.
As the Council moves forward, the debate over Israel’s actions in Doha is likely to influence broader Middle East diplomacy, the role of mediators, and the balance between counter-terrorism operations and international legal norms.
Pakistan’s leadership in condemning the strike, combined with interventions from other Council members, demonstrates the continuing relevance of multilateral forums in addressing complex conflicts, even amid disagreement among major powers.</p><small>2025-09-12 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623308-cjp-bars-justice-mansoor-from-yale-conference-trip' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi bars Justice Mansoor from Yale conference trip</strong></a><br><p>

The country was placed on Wada’s watchlist in September 2024 over outstanding non-conformities to the agency’s updated anti-doping code.
According to the spokesperson, WADA confirmed that the compliance procedure against Pakistan’s Anti-Doping Organisation (Adop) was closed after all pending corrective actions were completed.
“A follow-up confirmation from Wada in September reiterated that Pakistan was no longer under enhanced monitoring, ending speculation over possible sanctions,” the statement said.
PSB Deputy Director General (DG) Shahid Islam was informed of the decision by Wada via email, the PSB spokesperson told Dawn.com.
The statement also said that corrective measures were put under PSB DG Yasir Pirzada’s leadership, including policy alignment and procedural reforms, ensuring that Pakistan met the stringent global standards in time.
“This is not just a bureaucratic victory; it is a lifeline for Pakistani athletes and sports federations,” Pirzada was quoted as saying.
“For a country preparing to showcase itself on major sporting platforms, this clearance from Wada marks a vital step forward,” the statement added.
It also highlighted that the failure to meet critical anti-doping requirements by January would trigger automatic non-compliance, which “could have barred Pakistani athletes from competing under the national flag and risked international isolation in sport”.
Last year, Wada placed seven national anti-doping organisations on a watchlist, giving them four more months “to correct outstanding non-conformities” to a new anti-doping code. The countries included Namibia, Pakistan, Panama, Samoa, Senegal, Uganda and Uruguay.
In May, the body’s president Witold Banka pushed back against what he called the growing politicisation of efforts to stem the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. “The politicisation of anti-doping is something which is very concerning,” he said.
“We see more and more attempts to politicise the anti-doping environment. There is no place for politics or turf wars in the fight for clean sport,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-12 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12124422662bbf0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941436/france-deploys-three-rafale-fighter-jets-to-help-protect-polish-airspace-macron-says' target='_blank'><strong>France deploys three Rafale fighter jets to help protect Polish airspace, Macron says</strong></a><br><p>France will deploy three Rafale fighter jets to help Poland protect its airspace after this week’s drone incursions into its airspace, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday on X.
“The security of the European continent is our top priority. We will not give in to Russia’s increasing intimidation,” he said.
 






A French military official said the warplanes had already been deployed to Poland prior to Tuesday’s incursions.
On Tuesday, Poland said it had scrambled aircraft alongside allies to shoot down “hostile objects” violating its airspace during a Russian attack on neighbouring Ukraine, a first for a NATO country during the war.
The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles (80 kilometres) from the Polish border.
Responding to the accusation, Russia’s foreign ministry claimed that its drones had carried out a major attack on military facilities in western Ukraine but stressed that there were no plans to hit any targets in Poland.
Subsequently, Poland — a NATO member, invoked the Western defence alliance’s Article 4 for urgent talks in reaction to the violation.
Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its “territorial integrity, political independence or security” are at risk.
Poland’s European partners in NATO have backed the country, with the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Sweden each summoning their Russian ambassadors on Thursday to protest.
Germany announced it would expand its role in a Nato mission to defend Polish airspace.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting today to discuss violations of Poland’s airspace.
Stray Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of Nato members, including Poland, several times since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland, calling the incident a “provocation”.
Poland in 2023 said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine. And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.</p><small>2025-09-12 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623295-pakistan-will-have-to-adapt-to-floods-as-the-new-normal' target='_blank'><strong>'Pakistan will have to adapt to floods as the new normal'</strong></a><br><p>

“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”
 






Landau did not elaborate on what such action would mean.
Some users replied to Landau’s post with screenshots of accounts and posts, though it was unclear if the accounts they flagged were US visa holders.
The State Department’s number two then replied to some of those comments, saying he would direct consular officials to monitor the comments on the post, which as of Thursday afternoon had over 2,000 replies.
A State Department spokesperson, asked about Landau’s post, said: “This Administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.”
But the spokesperson did not address questions on whether anybody had been identified to have their visa revoked or how consular officials would evaluate those flagged in response to Landau’s post.
Kirk, a 31-year-old author, podcast host and close ally of US President Donald Trump, helped build the Republican Party’s support among younger voters.
He was killed on Wednesday by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah in what President Donald Trump called a “heinous assassination.”
The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping crackdown on immigration, including increasing social media vetting and revoking thousands of student visas and aiming to tighten the duration of others.</p><small>2025-09-12 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623288-at-unsc-pakistan-condemns-israels-reckless-attack-on-qatar' target='_blank'><strong>'Broader, consistent pattern of aggression': Pakistan assails Israel on Qatar strikes at UN</strong></a><br><p>

One suspect is currently in custody, while another of his alleged accomplices have been identified and efforts are underway to arrest him, DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
The suspect, a fruit vendor, was apprehended by Defence police from Qayyumabad with the help of locals, the officer said.
Investigations are underway, and police are said to have obtained video evidence of multiple incidents of sexual assault against minor boys and girls. Although it is too early to say just how many victims the suspects have assaulted, investigators think they could number over a hundred.
“Police have recovered a mobile phone from his custody containing hundreds of videos filmed in his room that show graphic scenes involving children,” DIG Raza said, adding that he was being interrogated further.

DIG South says efforts underway to track down his accomplices; scores of videos unearthed from phone, USB drive suggest suspect had been preying on children for years

According to police, the suspect came to Qayyumabad in 2016 and started luring and trapping children around 2019. He first opened a grocery shop, and then a juice cart.
When asked how he managed to keep his activities clandestine for such a long period of time, DIG Raza also expressed surprise, saying that the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect.
The victim then took the USB to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it, but the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
“A USB and the mobile phone are in police custody which contain many such videos,” said the DIG.
Police then approached the parents of the victims, who came to the police station and lodged three FIRs against the suspect. A special team — led by DSP Defence Dr Saifullah — has been set up to investigate the case. The committee also includes the Defence SHO, SIO Defence, and the SIO Women Police Station.
“The team shall make hectic efforts into the cases by utilising all available resources and shall submit reports on a daily basis,” according to a police order.
The FIRs, registered on the complaint of the father of a couple of victims, states that the two girls, aged 10 and 12, had been upset for some days and complained about pain in their body. When quizzed by their mother, they revealed that the suspect had sexually assaulted them.
Another complainant, a labourer, has filed a case on behalf of his 10-year-old sister, who also complained of pain after the suspect took her to his residence on Sept 4, and assaulted her. The act was also filmed, according to the FIR.
A third complainant said that his seven-year old daughter had been silent for one week and also complained of pain.

Kirk, 31, a superstar on the Republican right and a close ally of President Donald Trump, was killed by a single gunshot to the neck while addressing a large crowd on Wednesday. The FBI has described the killing as a “targeted event”.
The FBI issued grainy photos of a person of interest wearing a black baseball cap, dark sunglasses and what appeared to be jeans, with a long-sleeved top emblazoned with a design including an American flag.
Authorities described the suspect as being of university age and acknowledged the gunman remained at large after escaping into woodland.
“We’re doing everything we can to find him, and we’re not sure how far he has gone yet, but we will do our best,” FBI Special Agent Robert Bohls told a media briefing. The FBI also announced a reward of up to $100,000 for information.
Mr Bohls said the presumed murder weapon, a “high powered bolt action rifle,” was recovered in a wooded area where the shooter had fled.
Investigators found ammunition engraved with expressions of transgender and antifascist ideology inside the rifle, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the investigation.
It was Trump who first announced Kirk’s death. In a video address, Trump cited a “dark moment for America” and suggested the left wing was responsible. On Thursday, the president paid tribute to Kirk as a “giant of his generation” and announced he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honour.

According to officials, a failure to act in time would have “serious security implications” for at least 10 other districts and further complicated the security situation in the province bordering Afghanistan. A civil administration official told Dawn that the militants would have overrun KP had they not been contained in the upper reaches of Bajaur.
“The district serves as a transit route to nine districts of Malakand division as well as Katlang in Mardan. All these areas are interconnected,” the official said, while referring to the districts of Upper and Lower Dir, Shangla, Swat, Buner, Malakand, and Katlang in Mardan.
Another official said that the “threat projection was big” and the situation would have been more difficult to handle if timely action had not been taken. The targeted action, the official said, forced a large number of militants to flee and they were now believed to have concentrated in regions close to the border.
 
 

The official said the security forces cleared 11 of the 36 areas and over 3,000 families, who were temporarily displaced, had returned to their homes.
“We thought that Damadola and Kitkot with build-up areas would turn out to be tough. Militants have now retreated from the area and we are in the process of sanitisation before allowing people to return to their homes and hearths,” the official said.
Damadola, about seven kilometres from the Afghan border, has always been a militant hotbed. It gained national and international attention in January 2006 when the US strikes killed a number of seminary students. Pakistan had distanced itself from the strike, which reportedly targeted Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Officials believed that if the targeted action continued at the same pace, remaining areas could be cleared in the near future and people would be able to return home ahead of winter. Bajaur, the official claimed, could serve as a model in other districts affected by militancy.
 
 

This was the first time a targeted area-wise operation was launched by engaging the local population, who were encouraged to ask militants to leave the area to avoid displacement and damage to their property.
Authorities began the process of engagement with the area notables on July 30. Negotiations continued for fourteen days but following the militants’ refusal to leave the area, residents agreed to vacate their areas for the targeted operation.
A document seen by Dawn revealed that the notables acknowledged that the protection of life and property was the responsibility of the state, thus empowering the security forces to establish the writ of the state. The document also emphasised that efforts would be made to minimise the damage to the property and allow for compensation.
This enabled the security forces to undertake action without fear of harming and causing civilian casualties and damage to properties, the official added.
Accordingly, 21,000 families left their homes, out of which 8200 were provided shelter at government-owned buildings, while 12,800 stayed with the community. “The most remarkable thing was to facilitate the return of people to six villages of Tarkho within five days of their displacement on August 21. Subsequently, six more areas were cleared and residents were allowed to return on September 8,” the official said.

Party leaders alleged that those behind the attack sought to eliminate the province’s “true political leadership”.
Large numbers of workers and supporters, carrying party flags and banners inscribed with anti-government slogans, gathered outside the Quetta Press Club.
The demonstration was led by Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, BNP-M Senior Vice President Sajid Tareen Advocate, Awami National Party (ANP) Balochistan Presi­dent Asghar Khan Acha­kzai, Jamaat-i-Islami Balo­chistan Naib Emir Zahid Akhtar, and leaders from PTI and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM).
Mr Ziaratwal strongly condemned the suicide attack, warning that such assaults threatened all political parties.
“These attacks cannot force the true leadership to abandon its struggle for the rights of the people of Balochistan,” he said, vowing that PkMAP would continue its democratic struggle without fear.
BNP-M’s Sajid Tareen said party workers had gathered peacefully at Shahwani Stadium to pay tribute to the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal, yet were “punished” with violence that claimed the lives of 15 BNP workers and injured many more.
He said the province-wide wheel-jam and shutter-down strike had demonstrated the people’s rejection of “the rulers’ oppressive attitude”.
He added that his party would not bow down to anyone and would continue its struggle for the rights of people of Balochistan and its resources.
ANP’s Asghar Khan Achakzai said Baloch­istan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were facing systematic attempts to seize their natural resources.
He called for unity among political parties to protect provincial rights and condemned the detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch and other female activists, demanding their immediate release.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar recalled the alliance’s long march to Islamabad, saying the federal government “trembled” at the sight of their protest.
He reaffirmed JI’s full support for the opposition alliance’s decisions. PTI and MWM leaders also addressed the gathering.
Similar protest demonstrations were held in Turbat, Gwadar, Loralai, Noshki and several other towns of Balochistan.

A two-member bench, led by Chief Justice Sar­dar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, will hear on September 16 the petition filed by Advocate Mian Dawood.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against Justice Jahangiri, arguing that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from the University of Karachi — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
 
 

The petitioner has bas­ed his case on official correspondence from the Uni­versity of Karachi, which is attached as evidence.

Justice Dogar’s predecessor had reserved judgement on maintainability of plea; fresh hearings will delve into substantive allegations

The petition was initially filed earlier this year. Former IHC CJ Aamer Farooq had reserved judgement on the preliminary issue of whether the petition was maintainable.
With the case now listed for a fresh hearing before a new bench, the court is poised to potentially delve into the substantive allegations.
The key allegations include use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The University of Karachi has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The enrolment number AIL-5968/87, which appears on Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I mark sheet, was officially allocated by the university to another individual, Imtiaz Ahmad, son of Muhammad Ellahi.
Furthermore, the principal of Government Islamia Law College, Karachi, stated in a letter that a student named “Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram”, under enrolment number AIL-7124/87, was never admitted to the college for the LLB programme during the relevant period.
In addition, the Controller of Examinations at the University of Karachi concluded in an official letter that the degree and mark sheets in question are “invalid”.
The petition argues that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
Citing judgments like the Sajjad Ali Shah case, the petitioner contended that the presence of a judge with an allegedly invalid degree “shakes public confidence” and “tarnishes the image of the judiciary as a neutral arbiter”.
It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, along with two other judges —Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the Islamabad High Court.
He was also among the cohort that, last year, wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council, alleging interference by intelligence agencies in the judicial matters.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.

• PM Shehbaz lauds Doha’s mediatory role for Gaza peace
WASHINGTON / ISLAM­ABAD: Members of the UN Security Council railed against Israel’s “illegal and unprovoked aggression” against Qatar, recalling that in the span of mere days, it has struck Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and now the main peace broker in Gaza.
Some nations even called for levying sanctions on Tel Aviv “before it was too late”.
In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, the Council also condemned the strikes, calling for “de-escalation” and expressing solidarity with Qatar, but without naming Israel.
Calling Doha “the territory of a key mediator” for peace talks between Israel and Hamas, the council also “underlined their support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar.”
Meanwhile, at a special UNSC briefing — jointly requested by Pakistan, Algeria and Somalia — Pakistan’s Permanent Repre­s­e­n­tative Asim Iftikhar Ahmad welcomed the condemnation, but called for further steps.
 
 

“The Council must go beyond; must hold Israel accountable; safeguard the role and protection of mediators engaged in peace efforts; and recommit to the centrality of international law and the UN Charter in maintaining international peace and security,” he urged.
The briefing was held under the agenda item ‘Situation in the Middle East’, and was attended by Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani.
“The brazen and illegal assault is not an isolated incident, rather it is part of a broader and consistent pattern of aggression and violation of international law by Israel that undermines regional peace and stability,” Ambassafor Ahmad said.
Even Dorothy Shea, the US envoy, stressed that unilateral bombing inside Qatar does not serve the interests of either Israel or the US.
However, she emphasised that this should not be used to cast doubt on Israel’s commitment to bringing its prisoners home.
Algerian Ambassador Amar Bendjama noted that “Israel behaves as if law does not exist, as if borders are illusions and the UN Charter is an ephemeral text.”
He pointed out that Qatar was the fourth country attacked by Israel in as many days, condemning “the conduct of an extremist government” and urging the Council to use all its tools — including sanctions — “before it is too late”.
Arab diplomacy
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates on Thursday condemned Israel’s threat of further attacks on Qatar, warning that any assault on a Gulf nation amounted to an attack on the “collective Gulf security framework”.
The remarks came in response to a threat made by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu who said that Doha must expel or prosecute senior Hamas officials, “because if you don’t, we will”.
 
 

The incident prompted a fierce backlash across the Arab world and triggered urgent efforts to coordinate a regional response.
UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan embarked on a tour of Gulf capitals, a move his diplomacy adviser, Anwar Gargash, said was aimed at “reinforcing the concept of a common destiny”.
Meanwhile, at the funeral of those slain in Doha on Thursday, coffins draped in Qatari and Palestinian flags were carried into a packed mosque, underscoring the dual impact of the strike.
Hamas confirmed that five of the dead were part of its political operation, including the son of veteran negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. The Qatari soldier who died was named as Lance Corporal Badr Saad Mohammed al-Humaidi al-Dosari.
Hamas officials accused Israel of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal. Fawzi Barhoum, a senior spokesperson, described the airstrike as “an assassination of the entire negotiation process” and accused the US of complicity.
An emergency Arab-Islamic summit will be held in Qatar on Sunday and Monday to discuss next steps.
Shehbaz in Doha
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday rushed to Qatar to express solidarity with its people and the government after Israel struck the Hamas leadership in Doha in “a blatant violation of international laws”.
During his one-day visit, the prime minister met Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and conveyed Pakistan’s strongest condemnation of the Sept 9 Israeli attack, which he termed “a blatant and flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
He appreciated Qatar’s responsible, constructive and mediatory role in efforts to bring peace in Gaza, and stressed that such acts of Israeli aggression were clearly meant to undermine regional stability and threaten ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an extraordinary Arab-Islamic Summit on Sept 15, and said Pakistan had indicated its willingness to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to co-sponsor and co-convene this summit.

• 19 militants killed in separate operations across KP
• President, PM laud successful operations
• Tribal elders vow to expel militants from South Waziristan, announce strict penalties
LOWER DIR / PESH­AWAR: At least seven Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were martyred and 13 others injured during a search and strike operation against militants in the Sar Banda area of Maidan in Lower Dir on Thursday.
According to official sources, one FC soldier was also reported missing after a fierce gun battle with militants in the mountainous terrain within the jurisdiction of Lal Qila police station. The militants had taken positions and opened fire on a security convoy.
The wounded were shifted to Lal Qila Hospital, and later referred to District Headquarters Hospital Timergara.
Police officials said a heavy contingent of pol­ice, Elite Force and Dir Scouts remained in the area as the operation continued.
Security forces also claimed to have inflicted “significant losses” on the militants, though no details were immediately provided.
Lal Qila was once a stronghold of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muhammadi (TNSM), led by Maulana Sufi Muhammad.
His son-in-law, Mullah Fazlullah, became the head of the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) and fled to Afghanistan during the 2009 military offensive in Malakand. He was later killed in an air strike in Afghanistan.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operations. In their statements, both leaders lauded the bravery and professionalism of the troops in eliminating 19 militants, APP reported.
“Pakistan is determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorism,” President Zardari said, reaffirming the nation’s resolve to completely eradicate terrorism and praying for the safety and success of the security forces. PM Shehbaz also commended the security forces for successful operations in Mohmand, North Waziristan and Bannu, reiterating that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete elimination from the country.
Police post
Separately, militants launched a late-night assault on the Lajbook police post. Police sources said personnel deployed there repelled the attack after several hours of firing, forcing the militants to retreat. No casualties were reported.
In another development, the Lower Dir district administration imposed Section 144 on Thursday, banning the flying of drones, quadcopters and balloons across the district. Deputy Comm­issioner Mohammad Arif Khan directed assistant commissioners and police officials to ensure strict enforcement, warning that violators would face legal action.
19 militants killed
At least 19 militants were killed in three separate encounters with security forces across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“On 9-10 Sept, nineteen Khawarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in KP” the ISPR said in a statement.
According to the statement, 14 militants were killed after troops engaged their hideout in an intense exchange of fire in the Guluno area of Mohmand district.
Another operation in Datta Khel, North Waziristan, left four more militants dead, while a separate encounter in Bannu resulted in the killing of one militant.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain fighters, who, the ISPR said, had been involved in numerous attacks in the region. Troops were carrying out sanitisation operations to clear the area of remaining militants.
The ISPR reiterated that security forces were committed to wiping out “the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
Meanwhile, tribal elders of the Toji Khel tribe in South Waziristan resolved in a meeting on Sept 9 not to allow militants to operate from their soil. They warned militants to leave the area or face exile.
The elders also announced strict penalties, including demolition of houses and a fine of Rs2 million, against anyone found facilitating militants with food, shelter or other assistance.

LAHORE: Punjab is facing a relentless flood emergency as the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers continue to swell, inundating thousands of villages and displacing millions across the province.
The situation intensified after Indian authorities issued alerts regarding rising water levels at Ganda Singh Wala and Ferozepur two days ago, prompting renewed evacuations along the Sutlej River.
Despite some areas witnessing a slight recession in water levels, the overall flood threat remains severe, with rescue and relief operations stretched across multiple districts.
At Panjnad Headworks on the Chenab River, water discharge surged to an exceptionally high level, crossing 668,000 cusecs. Between Wednesday morning and early Thursday, the flow increased by 100,000 cusecs, triggering mass evacuations in Alipur tehsil.
 
 

In a late night development, a protective dyke near the city of Shujabad collapsed for a second time, inundating communities along the river bank.
The downstream pressure has also impacted Sindh’s Guddu and Sukkur barrages, which continue to record medium flood levels with flows exceeding 400,000 cusecs.
In Rahim Yar Khan, authorities reported 660,000 cusecs passing through Chachran Sharif, though no immediate threat to localities was identified.
According to the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) data, Pan­jnad witnessed outflows of over 668,000 cusecs, with a steady trend, while Guddu and Sukkur barrages had a flow of over 400,000 cusecs.
On the other hand, flood levels in Punjab rivers receded further, with Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River near the Indian border in a “medium” flood.
PDMA River Flows report relea­sed at 6:30pm revealed that on the Chenab River, Marala Headworks was steady at 68,986 cusecs, Khanki Headworks was rising at 82,411 cusecs, and Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 84,440 cusecs.
At Chiniot Bridge, the flow was rising at 57,463 cusecs, while the Rivaz Bridge gauge level was steady at 518 feet.
At Trimmu Headworks, the flow was steady at 140,007 cusecs. The Head Muhammad Wala gauge was falling at 412.38 feet, the Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.20 feet and Panjnad Headworks was flowing extremely heavy at 658,845 cusecs.
On the Ravi River, conditions were steady at all locations: Jassar was reporting 19,500 cusecs, Ravi Syphon 32,120 cusecs, Shahdara 31,682 cusecs, Balloki Headworks 59,580 cusecs, and Sidhnai Headworks 75,549 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, flows were predominantly steady: Ganda Singh Wala was at 98,165 cusecs, and Sulemanki Headworks was at 121,459 cusecs. An exception was Islam Headworks, where the flow was falling at 113,956 cusecs, while the Mailsi Syphon was steady at 120,150 cusecs.
For the Indus River upstream of Guddu, the Chachran Bridge gauge was steady at 298.25 feet, and the Guddu Barrage flow was steady at 506,433 cusecs.
Tragedies, displacement
In Bahawalnagar, two people drowned after a Rescue 1122 boat carrying 23 evacuees capsized. In Jalalpur Pirwala, another rescue bo­­­­at carrying 25 people overturned, leaving five, including children, missing. In Muzaf­fargarh, three teenagers fell into floodwaters near Basti Jarah; one died and two were rescued.
Authorities reported thousands fleeing their homes in Seetpur, Khairpur and Bait Nabi Shah in Muzaffargarh, as well as in Jalalpur Pirwala, where 706,000 people across 148 mou­­zas have been affected. In Khanewal, 159,029 people were evacuated from riverbeds, while 128,658 acres of crops were submerged.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said more than 4,500 villages and 4.287 million people have been affected by floods across the province, with 2.262m relocated.
He said 396 relief camps, 490 medical camps and 412 veterinary camps have been set up, while 1.696m animals have been shifted to safer areas. A total of 79 people have lost their lives in the floods, he added.
Rescue, relief efforts
Punjab Emergency Service Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said over 13,600 people were rescued in the past three days in Multan alone, with more than 25,000 relocated. Across the province, more than 362,000 people have been evacuated using 139 rescue boats.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said four helicopters and 2,000 tents have been deployed to Jalalpur Pirwala, where reli­­ef distribution continues with army support.
Rahim Yar Khan Deputy Commissioner Khurrum Parvaiz told Dawn that water levels were rising downstream of Panjnad, prompting evacuation operations in the riverbed areas of Khanpur and Liaquatpur. He said around 12,000 people had been evacuated, six relief camps established and 1,800 tents distributed among flood-affected families.
The deputy commissioner added that all dy­­k­­es in the district were intact, with 660,000 cu­­secs passing through Chachran Sharif, and as­sured there was no threat to nearby localities.
 
 

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had ord­ered the removal of the Assistant Commis­sioner of Jalalpur Pirwala over negligence after a rescue boat capsized. She added that water levels at Muhammad Wala and Sher Shah bridges had fallen below critical levels, ruling out immediate breaching of dykes.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman visited Panjnad Headworks, where he was briefed on inflows and discharges. Officials confirmed that evacuation of low-lying areas was ongoing, with all embankments under constant monitoring.
Meanwhile, officials said Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, India’s Bhakra 90pc, Pong 99pc and Thein 97pc, increasing downstream pressure.
Balochistan rains
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Thursday that Pakistan was facing the final monsoon spell of this season, adding that during the past two days, the floodwater heading south was “losing steam”, Dawn.com reported.
“The water in our rivers came in two layers,” he explained. “The first is hitting Guddu Barrage, the other is at Panjnad. Based on this information, we expect that it will stabilise in the next two to three days.”
Several areas of Balochistan have been lashed by torrential monsoon rains over the past two days, triggering flash floods and prompting the PDMA to issue an alert on Thursday. District administrations have been directed to take urgent measures to protect residents from possible devastation.
Officials said seasonal rivers and streams were already carrying heavy rainwater, with the risk of severe flooding if showers continued in the catchment areas.
At Hub Dam, water levels rose rapidly to 338 feet, just one foot short of its full capacity of 339 feet. A senior Irrigation Department official said the spillways could be opened at any time, and people living along the Hub Riv­er had been warned to move to safer locations.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government has completed arrangements along the left bank of the Indus River in anticipation of floodwaters expected to arrive from Punjab’s Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers within the next few days.
Rescue teams, boats and heavy machinery have been deployed in the border areas of Nasirabad division, including Nasirabad, Usta Muhammad, Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad.
“For the past week, rescue staff and equipment have been positioned along the Sindh-Balochistan border,” an official said.
Balochistan Irrigation Minister Sadiq Um­­rani told the provincial assembly that preparations were in place to shift people from vulnerable areas to safety. He added that an understanding had been reached with the Sindh government that no embankments would be deliberately breached if water reached dangerous levels. “If over 1.1 million cusecs flow through the Indus, the chief ministers of both provinces will decide further action,” he said.
Balochistan PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan said 16 flood control centres had been set up across four districts of Nasirabad division, operating round the clock. Rescue and relief arrangements, including provision of essential goods, had been finalised to assist displaced families.

“It flows unconditionally from the solemnisation of a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his decision on an appeal by Ambreen Akram. She had challenged the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) verdict of April 28, 2015, which turned down her plea for maintenance because the marriage was not consummated.
“In essence, the only legitimate ground for suspending this obligation (maintenance) arises where the husband discharges a high burden of proof to establish that his wife has wholly and without justification withdrawn from marital relationship, not merely as physical access but encompassing the full spectrum of emotional, residential and relational life,” Justice Shah explained in his 15-page judgement.

Justice Shah says claim to maintenance takes effect with solemnisation of marriage; criticises LHC observations as ‘deeply patriarchal’

“Absent such proof, the obligation to provide maintenance persists,” Justice Shah emphasised.
Two fundamental questions
The judgement observed that the case raises two fundamental questions at the intersection of Islamic law, constitutional rights and social realities: When does a Muslim woman become entitled to maintenance within a marriage?
And, under what circumstances, may a man be excused from his marital obligation to pay maintenance to his wife?
 
 

At stake is not merely the contemporary interpretation of Islamic law but the very meaning of marriage (Nikah) and marital relationship, the scope of financial independence of a woman within marriage and the Constitution’s promise to uphold the dignity, privacy and equality of an individual, the protection of the family and participation of women in all spheres of life, the judgement explained.
The case pertains to Ambreen Akram’s marriage to  Asadullah Khan in Nov 2012. Despite a valid Nikahnama, Asad­ullah delayed Rukhsati for over a year.
So Ambreen Akram filed for maintenance in Oct 2013.
Claim upheld
A family court in Faisalabad upheld her claim, awarding an amount of Rs3000 per month as maintenance with effect from the date of marriage. The amount was later raised by Faisalabad’s District Court to Rs5000.
Asadullah Khan divorced his wife on May 2, 2014. But the LHC reversed the decision, citing lack of consummation.
The Supreme Court observed in its judgement that Asadullah Khan had failed to provide a marital abode, made no arrangements for rukhsati and did not fulfil his basic obligations under the marital contract.
There is no factual or legal basis to invoke an exception to the husband’s obligation of maintenance, Justice Shah observed.
 
 

“No credible evidence has led to suggest that the petitioner wilfully withdrew from the marital relationship or refused cohabitation without valid cause,” the apex court judge said.
The wife’s inability to cohabit due to husband’s own failure to facilitate Rukhsati does not defeat her claim to maintenance, the judgement explained.
Hence Ambreen Akram cannot be penalised for non-consummation as it resulted from her husband’s own inaction, Justice Shah said.
“To suggest otherwise would allow men to weaponise the absence of consummation, often caused by their own neglect, as a means to escape financial responsibility, thereby trapping women in marriages devoid of rights and dignity,” the judgement cautioned.
The Supreme Court held that the petitioner’s right to maintenance took effect with the solemnisation of marriage and continued as long as the bond lasted.
Considering that the divorce took place during the pendency of the litigation, the maintenance period will continue till the period of Iddat, the judgement added.
“The denial of maintenance in the light of husband’s default and in the absence of any fault on part of the wife, was contrary to law and accordingly set aside,” Justice Shah observed.
In his judgement, Justice Shah went on to say that a reading of Islamic jurisprudence, statutory enactments, constitutional protections and judicial precedents affirm that a woman’s right to maintenance was neither contingent upon consummation or rukhsati, nor subject to discretion of her husband.
This understanding not only gives effect to the egalitarian spirit of Islamic law but also reinforces constitutional commitment to dignity (Article 14), equality (Article 25), and protection of the family unit (Article 35).
“In a patriarchal society where economic dependence often fuels systemic injustice, the right to maintenance must be safeguarded as an essential constitutional, legal and ethical entitlement.
“Any attempt to curtail it must therefore be subjected to strictest constitutional and jurisprudential scrutiny, the judgement emphasised.
The Supreme Court set aside the LHC judgement by holding that Ambreen Akram’s entitlement to maintenance of Rs5000 per month began on the date the marriage was solemnised. It will include maintenance for the period of Iddat.
Concern over LHC verdict  In his concluding remarks, Justice Man­soor Ali Shah noted with concern the language used in the LHC judgement.
The High Court verdict stated: “Maintenance allowance is the right of wife after consummation of marriage and after crossing the barrier, it becomes the responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife.”
Justice Shah criticised the observations as “deeply patriarchal”.
These expressions cast women as passive recipients in marriage rather than equal partners, undermining their legal and constitutional status, the judge said.

A CTD Balochistan spokesman said on Thursday that the joint operation was launched on intelligence-based information about the presence of the terrorist group in Akalzai Yaro area in Pishin.
 
 

The terrorists opened fire on the CTD personnel when they cordoned off the area. However, the security personnel immediately retaliated, and a heavy exchange of fire continued for over an hour. During the gun battle, four members of Fitna al Khawarij — the term used by the state for the TTP — were killed, the spokesman said, adding that a large quantity of arms and ammunition was recovered from their hideout.
The seized weapons included two SMGs with magazines and cartridges, two 9mm pistols with cartridges, three hand grenades, a large quantity of explosive material, prima cord, and detonators.

Gunmen slay four in Kharan; as many abducted

The spokesman further said that the slain suspects had been directly involved in several terrorist incidents, including multiple casualty improvised explosive device (MCIED) attack on an FC truck in Chaman in Jan, IED attack on a Levies dafadar on College Road in Chaman in March, target killing of police official Mohammad Hashim in Oct 2022, and killing of another police official, Shaheed Zainullah in Nov 2022.
Further investigation is underway, the CTD Balochistan spokesman added.
Kharan attack
Meanwhile, unknown armed men gunned down four members of a family and abducted four others from a remote area of Kharan district on Thursday.
Police said the incident took place in the Laja area of Kharan, where a large number of armed men arrived late Wednesday night. After identifying a house, they barged in and opened fire on its residents, killing four people — three of them brothers — on the spot.
“The armed men fired multiple rounds at the victims, causing their instant death,” a senior police officer said, adding that the bodies were badly mutilated due to the excessive number of bullets.
Police officials also confirmed that the attackers took away four relatives of the deceased while leaving the area. Sources said the victims belonged to local tribes of Laja.
“It appears to be a case of target killing,” police officials in Kharan said, adding that an investigation was underway. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the killings.

A series of posts shared on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, which were supposedly based on his conversation with his sisters in Adiala Jail, recalled that the former ruling ANP had become unpopular in the province due to its support for such military action.
Although Mr Khan does not have access to his X account while in prison, it is not clear who operates it in his stead.
“Killing one’s own always leads to an increase in terrorism,” the post on the ex-PM’s official account said.
The message instructed all members of provincial and national assemblies and the Senate who are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “to come together and resist these  operations and drone strikes against our own people, and to work for  peace so that issues can be resolved through dialogue”.
Continuing his mantra of favouring negotiations over kinetic action, he also regretted the forcible expulsion of Afghans from the country. “These measures must stop immediately, otherwise the situation will deteriorate further.”
 






Mr Khan also expressed indignation over the attacks on his wife and sisters, saying that they had no role in politics.
“Aleema Khan only conveys my message, while the campaign against her reflects the regime’s fear. Bushra Begum has never interfered in political decisions and is suffering solitary confinement only because she is my wife.”
 






The PTI founder also criticised the “sham trials” that, in his words, are being used to snatch parliamentary seats. He pointed out that senior leader Ejaz Chaudhry’s seat was “unlawfully” awarded to Rana Sanaullah.
On the occasion of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s death anniversary, Mr Khan also paid tribute to Pakistan’s founding father, reaffirming his party’s resolve to continue its struggle for democratic rights.

PM Shehbaz reached Doha today on a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after the attacks, state media reported.
“The prime minister emphasised that Israel’s ongoing aggression in the Middle East must be stopped and the Muslim world needs unity in its ranks to confront Israeli provocations,” according to a statement by state broadcaster PTV on X.
 






The statement said the prime minister strongly condemned the Israeli attack as a “blatant violation” of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that the leadership and people of Pakistan were deeply concerned about the attack, which was contrary to international laws.
“Reaffirming the historical and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, the prime minister said that both countries stand with each other. “In this spirit of brotherhood, Pakistan has stood shoulder to shoulder with his highness the emir of Qatar, the royal family and the brotherly people of Qatar during this difficult time.”
He assured the Qatari leadership of Pakistan’s complete solidarity and support against this unjustified provocation, statement said, adding that he also expressed deep sympathy over the loss of precious lives in Israel’s brutal and heinous attack and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated Qatar’s “responsible and constructive mediation role” in efforts to establish peace in Gaza, stressing that Israeli actions, such as the Doha strikes, “clearly aim to undermine regional stability and jeopardise ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts”.
Qatar and Egypt have been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
According to Hamas sources, the group’s representatives were targeted in Doha by Israel on Tuesday while they were discussing United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Qatar had condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In today’s meeting with the Qatari emir, PM Shehbaz recalled that after the Israeli attack in Doha, Pakistan called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council at Qatar’s request to discuss recent developments in the Middle East.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an Arab-Islamic Summit on September 15, saying that Pakistan had expressed its willingness to co-sponsor and co-organise the summit with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The prime minister also thanked his highness the emir for Qatar’s strong support for Pakistan during India’s unjustified aggression against Pakistan earlier this year. The emir of Qatar thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for visiting Doha to express solidarity.
“Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination in promoting regional peace, upholding international law and supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. During the visit, both leaders reaffirmed the deep brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar and their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the statement concluded.
The prime minister later departed after wrapping up his visit. He was received earlier today and then seen off by Deputy PM and Minister of State for Defence Affairs Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman bin Hassan Al Thani.
 






The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi and others during the visit.
The Foreign Office earlier said that the visit underscored Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East”.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
Earlier this month, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and stability during a meeting between Pakistan’s top military official, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the Qatari military leadership on his visit to Qatar.</p><small>2025-09-11 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623218-several-pti-senators-quit-standing-committees-on-imran-khans-directives' target='_blank'><strong>Several PTI senators quit standing committees on Imran Khan's directives</strong></a><br><p>
