Addressing the 17th ECO Summit in Azerbaijan’s Khankendi city, the prime minister said two recent events — the Iran-Israel war and the India-Pakistan conflict — showed that “the forces of instability and chaos continue to destabilise our region for geo-political agendas.
“The evolving global landscape has made regional cooperation even more essential,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing the 10-nation Eurasian bloc. “ECO represents our best hope, and Pakistan is a proud partner in these collective efforts.”
Speaking about the 12-day Iran-Israel war, he said that “the unlawful, uncalled for and unjustified Israeli attack on Iran was the most recent manifestation of this dangerous trend.”
According to Iran’s health ministry, at least 627 people were killed and 4,870 wounded in Israeli strikes.
“Pakistan condemns this act of Israeli aggression against Iran and offers our condolences to the martyrs,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also condemned the recent Indian aggression against Pakistan and New Delhi’s attempts to weaponise water by holding the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance.
“The unprovoked and reckless Indian hostility directed at Pakistan after an unfortunate incident in India’s illegally occupied Kashmir was yet another attempt to destabilise regional peace.
“The world saw the steadfast determination of our armed forces under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir and the unyielding spirit of our resilient people who stood firm in the face of provocation and responded with courage and professionalism.”
India had launched missile attacks on several Pakistani cities after baselessly accusing Islamabad of backing an attack on held Kashmir’s Pahalgam town, which saw the killing of 26 tourists on April 22.
In response, Pakistan downed five Indian jets and launched retaliatory strikes on India. It took US intervention on May 10 for both countries to reach a ceasefire.
“We are witnessing a new and alarming trend with India’s weaponisation of water, illegal attempt to defy the World Bank-negotiated Indus Water Treaty and its blatant disregard for the recent ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) are unacceptable and should be rejected with contempt.”
Last week, the PCA in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. However, India “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself.
PM Shehbaz said the Indus waters were the lifeline of Pakistan’s 240 million people and India couldn’t be allowed to “pursue this dangerous path that will be regarded as an act of aggression by the people of Pakistan”.
The prime minister also voiced concerns over the situation in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli strikes there, which have killed more than 57,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023.
“The world is witnessing an unprecedented man-made catastrophe in Gaza, a region that has descended into an abyss of perpetual suffering,” the premier said.
“It is as if humanity no longer exists as famine looms large, while humanitarian workers, including UN personnel, are being attacked with impunity by Israel to cut off the only lifeline of the helpless and starving people of Gaza.”
He said Pakistan stood firmly against those who “perpetrate barbaric acts against innocent people, whether in Gaza, occupied Kashmir or Iran”.
Regarding the effects of climate change, the prime minister said Pakistan had undertaken a series of climate-related policy initiatives focused on the government’s Resilience, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF).
He proposed the development of low-emission corridors, ECO-wide carbon market platforms and a regional disaster resistance system.
 






Earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz held a bilateral meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the ECO Summit.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction over the progress made regarding investment prospects and agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of trade and investment.
They reiterated their resolve to strengthen the economic partnership, especially Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan, according to a statement by the PM’s Office.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the recent interactions between the leadership of both countries helped in making the relationship even stronger. He also invited President Aliyev to visit Pakistan.
In a post on X, the prime minister said he congratulated President Aliyev on “successfully hosting the summit and lauded Azerbaijan’s proactive role in ECO”.
 






He said they “reviewed the progress in Pakistan-Azerbaijan bilateral ties, which are growing stronger through our frequent and productive high-level exchanges”.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to deepen cooperation across diverse sectors, particularly trade and investment,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-04 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/041722361fd6a5d.jpg?r=172438' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922086/russia-pounds-kyiv-with-largest-drone-attack-hours-after-trump-putin-call' target='_blank'><strong>Russia pounds Kyiv with largest drone attack, hours after Trump-Putin call</strong></a><br><p>Russia pummelled Kyiv with the largest drone attack of the war, injuring at least 23 people and damaging buildings across the Ukrainian capital hours after US President Donald Trump spoke to Russia’s Vladimir Putin, officials said on Friday.
Air raid sirens, the whine of kamikaze drones and booming detonations reverberated from early evening until dawn as Russia launched what Ukraine’s Air Force said was a total of 539 drones and 11 missiles.
Families huddled in underground metro stations for shelter. Acrid smoke hung over the city centre. Outside a high-rise apartment block damaged by a drone, residents stood around surveying the scene as the clean-up job began. Some cried. Others looked on silently.
“I woke up to the sound of explosions, first the Shahed drones started buzzing, and then the explosions began,” said 40-year-old resident Maria Hilchenko. “Then people started screaming outside. The explosions from the Shaheds kept coming.”
President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is due to speak to Trump later on Friday about the war and a US pause in some deliveries of air defence missiles, called the attack “deliberately massive and cynical”.
“Notably, the first air raid alerts in our cities and regions yesterday began to blare almost simultaneously with media reports discussing a phone call between President Trump and Putin,” Zelensky said on X.
“Yet again, Russia is showing it has no intention of ending the war and terror,” he added, calling for increased pressure on Russia and more air defence equipment.
 






Kyiv officials said the attack damaged about 40 apartment blocks, passenger railway infrastructure, five schools and kindergartens, cafes and many cars in six of Kyiv’s 10 districts. Poland said the consular section of its embassy was damaged in central Kyiv, adding that staff were unharmed.
Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that 14 of the injured were taken to the hospital.
Ukraine’s state-owned railway Ukrzaliznytsia, the country’s largest carrier, said on Telegram that the attack on Kyiv forced them to divert a number of passenger trains, causing delays.
Damage was recorded on both sides of the wide Dnipro River bisecting the capital, and falling drone debris set a medical facility on fire in the leafy Holosiivskyi district, Klitschko said.
Russian airstrikes on Kyiv have intensified in recent weeks and included some of the deadliest assaults of the war on the city of 3 million people.
Call for sanctions
Trump said that the call with President Putin on Thursday resulted in no progress at all on efforts to end the war, and the Kremlin reiterated that Moscow would keep pushing to solve the conflict’s “root causes”.
Speaking to reporters on his return to Washington from a trip to Iowa, Trump said, “I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there, and I’m very disappointed.
“I’m just saying I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”
The decision by Washington to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances.
On Friday, Zelensky called for increased pressure on Moscow to change its “dumb, destructive behaviour”.
“For every such strike against people and human life, they must feel appropriate sanctions and other blows to their economy, their revenues, and their infrastructure,” he said.
Ukraine’s Air Force said it destroyed 478 of the air weapons Russia launched overnight. However, airstrikes were recorded in eight locations across Ukraine, with nine missiles and 63 drones, it added.
Social media videos showed people running to seek shelter, firefighters fighting blazes in the dark and ruined buildings with windows and facades blown out.
Both sides deny targeting civilians in the war that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the conflict, the vast majority of them Ukrainian. Many more soldiers are believed to have been killed on the front line, but neither side releases military casualty figures.
Late on Thursday, Russian shelling killed five people in and near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine said.
Zelensky to meet with Trump
Zelensky told reporters in Denmark that he hopes to speak to Trump today about the pause in some weapons shipments.
Speaking to reporters as he left Washington for Iowa, Trump said “we haven’t” completely paused the flow of weapons but blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for sending so many weapons that it risked weakening US defences.
“We’re giving weapons, but we’ve given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons,” he said. “And we’re working with them and trying to help them, but we haven’t [completely stopped]. You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.”
The pause in US weapons shipments caught Ukraine off guard and generated widespread confusion about Trump’s current views on the conflict, after saying last week he would try to free up a Patriot missile defence system for use by Kyiv.
Ukrainian leaders called in the acting US envoy to Kyiv on Wednesday to underline the importance of military aid from Washington, and caution that the pause in its weapons shipments would weaken Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia.
The Pentagon’s move has meant a cut in deliveries of the Patriot defence missiles that Ukraine relies on to destroy fast-moving ballistic missiles, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-07-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04163739a82a03d.jpg?r=163933' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-7-dead-8-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari' target='_blank'><strong>At least 7 dead, 8 injured as five-storey building collapses in Karachi’s Lyari</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people died and eight were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari area on Friday, Mayor Murtaza Wahab
said.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Wahab said: “According to the reliable reports so far, seven people have [lost their lives], whose bodies have been taken to the hospital, and we have succeeded in saving eight people.”
Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.
The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.
Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.

Visiting the location, Wahab said the government needs to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that have been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.
“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”
The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.
The deceased included three men and two women, according to a list of patients issued earlier today by Civil Hospital Karachi’s (CHK) Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma (SMBBIT).
The injured included four men, two women and a teenage girl. Five of those wounded had “minor injuries”, SMBBIT Executive Director Dr Muhammad Sabir Memon told Dawn.com.
The casualties included Fatima Babu and Hoor Bai — both aged 55 years — 21-year-old Prantic Arsi, 32-year-old Prem and 35-year-old Waseem Babu.
The injured were listed as 17-year-old Kishna Jumna Das, 25-year-old Rashid Aziz, 29-year-old Mujeeb Ali, 30-year-old Santia Chaitan and Chanda Jumma Lal, 45-year-old Ghulam Hussain, and 50-year-old Yousaf Subhan.
Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to AFP as a “worn-out building”.
Police official Arif Aziz told AFP that up to 100 people had been living in the building.
 


Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Ghani said: “Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.
“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” he added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.
“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.

Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.
“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by his media consultant, Zubair Memon.
“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.
 
 

In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
Over 100 personnel at site: Rescue 1122
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.
“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.
He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.
He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
The Rescue 1122 head affirmed that the operation would continue till the site was “cleared”.
Sindh CM seeks report
Taking notice of the incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed that rescue teams immediately rescue those trapped under the rubble, while immediate medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“This is an unfortunate incident; concerned authorities should submit an immediate report,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
CM Murad also sought details of dilapidated buildings in Karachi from the SBCA.
“Dangerous buildings should be identified immediately and practical steps should be taken to protect citizens,” CM Murad said. “Negligence will not be tolerated; protection of human lives is the top priority.”

Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori expressed his grief over the incident and ordered rescue authorities to conduct “immediate, effective, and coordinated relief operations”.
In a statement, he directed that all available resources be employed to safely rescue those trapped under the rubble, and that “every possible facility” be provided to the affected families.
“Any kind of neglect or carelessness will be intolerable,” Tessori warned.
 






President, PM stress preventing such future incidents
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep grief and sorrow over the incident, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
In separate statements, the president and the premier offered their “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the family members of those who lost their lives.
Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured, President Zardari directed the Sindh government to expedite the relief efforts and immediately rescue those trapped under the debris.
The president also ordered that the causes of the incident be determined immediately and that effective measures be implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.
 






PM Shehbaz also issued directives that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured.
“Such incidents must be prevented in the future by formulating a strategy on a priority basis,” the prime minister stressed.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, chairman of the PPP that governs Sindh, conveyed his condolences to the aggrieved families and wished the injured a quick recovery.
“I assure [the public] that the Sindh government will provide all assistance [needed],” Bilawal said in a statement shared by his party.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah also expressed their condolences.

Scores of people die each year during the rainy season due to flash floods and landslides across India, a country of 1.4 billion people.
Rivers swollen by lashing rain, including the mighty Beas, which starts from the region’s glacial peaks, disrupted several routes in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
The “cumulative damage” includes 69 people dead, and 110 others injured in different incidents over the past two weeks, the state’s revenue department said in a statement.
India’s meteorological department on Thursday issued a fresh alert for “heavy to very heavy rainfall” in Himachal Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand, another picturesque Himalayan state popular with Indian tourists.
India’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
Heavy monsoon rains claimed at least 30 lives and injured dozens in India’s remote northeast region in June.
 
 

It led to the Brahmaputra, another major river that originates in the Himalayas, overflowing into nearby towns and villages in India’s state of Assam.
Other instances of landslides and flash floods were also reported in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Manipur, with authorities pressing the Indian military to aid in relief and rescue operations.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
Last month, India’s financial capital Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.</p><small>2025-07-04 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0412464466e1558.jpg?r=124917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922052/over-5500-police-personnel-deployed-across-karachi-for-8th-muharram-processions-today' target='_blank'><strong>Over 5,500 police personnel deployed across Karachi for 8th Muharram processions today</strong></a><br><p>More than 5,500 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi on Friday for the security of 8th Muharram processions.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
According to the Karachi police, as many as 829 processions and 5,227 majalis are scheduled to take place during the first 10 days of Muharram.
“Karachi police [are] performing [their] duties at various locations in the city for the security of the 8th Muharram  processions,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.
A total of 5,543 police officers and personnel will be present to monitor and secure the central procession, the statement added.
It continued that apart from senior officers and 4,957 constables and head constables of the Karachi police, 586 NGOs will also be performing duty for the security of the central procession. Expert police snipers will also be deployed alongside the main procession.
“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 8th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing and keep the public safe from any inconvenience,” the statement said.
“The Karachi police are providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 8th Muharram processions.”
The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.
A day earlier, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a total of 49,662 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, and Shaheed Benazirabad from 8th Muharram till Ashura to prevent any untoward incident.
He added that 14,546 police personnel would be deployed for security of majalis, while 35,116 to protect Muharram processions. He further said that over 14,000 additional personnel had been assigned to ensure security of all events.
 
 

Also on Thursday, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) issued a traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
According to the KTP plan, Muharram processions on all three days will depart from Nishtar Park and culminate at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah after following their traditional fixed routes.
Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower. Additionally, vehicles performing sabeel, niaz or tabarruk were instructed to enter the procession route at Tower/Memon Mosque.
Lahore arrangements
Meanwhile, Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said in a statement that the rescue service’s secretary reviewed the final arrangements for Ashura and Muharram 9 on the chief minister’s instructions and over 12,000 personnel would be deployed on the weekend.
Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said the arrangements included 815 ambulances, 2,166 motorbikes, 316 fire and rescue emergency vehicles to be deployed.
He said over 1,350 staff would be deployed in Lahore, including 55 emergency ambulances, 300 rescue motorbikes, 44 fire and rescue and specialised emergency vehicles.
Naseer said that additional rescue posts would be set up at more than 1,000 important places on Ashura and Muharram 9 across Punjab and the Provincial Monitoring Cell would oversee all rescue operations. In case of any major emergency or challenging situation, immediate relief teams will also respond from the nearby districts, he said.
He added that district officers would also monitor all operations and keep the Provincial Monitoring Cell updated.
Along with the Ashura arrangements, Naseer said that routine rescue operations would also continue and district officers would mark alternative routes for the provision of immediate rescue services.
Naseer added that providing immediate rescue services to the general public would be ensured at all costs. “In case of any negligence, laziness or shortcomings, strict disciplinary action will be taken immediately,” he said.
Naseer directed citizens to dial 1122 immediately from the mobile app, landline and PTCL in case of an urban emergency.</p><small>2025-07-04 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04165155e6099f3.png?r=165350' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922078/pakistan-through-to-u13-u15-finals-at-asian-junior-squash-championship' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan through to U13, U15 finals at Asian junior squash championship</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan continued their dominance on the squash courts as four players advanced to the finals of the 32nd Asian Junior Individual Squash Championships in Gimcheon, South Korea, on Friday.

The announcements were made as Iqbal chaired a meeting of the National Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. Formed in April 2023, the body is working to develop a 10-year roadmap for accelerated adoption of AI in different sectors.
According to a statement from the Press Information Department, during the meeting, Iqbal emphasised that it was time for Pakistan to move with clarity and purpose.
“He stated that AI adoption cannot be advanced in isolation and must instead be guided by cross-sectoral collaboration, alignment with national priorities, and effective coordination across all relevant institutions,” the statement read.
It added that the taskforce was assigned a clear mandate to identify twelve key sectors, including education, health, agriculture, climate, business, and governance, where AI applications can generate measurable national benefits.
 






“Each sector will establish a multi-stakeholder working group, comprising experts from government, academia, and the private sector. These groups will develop sector-specific AI roadmaps, with defined objectives, timelines, and resource requirements,” the statement said. “The purpose is to ensure that Pakistan not only aligns with global technological trends but also maximises the utility of AI in solving domestic challenges.”
The minister also directed the establishment of a national AI fund to provide financial support for innovative ideas and pilot projects. To utilise these resources effectively, he called for the mapping of AI experts, research centres, and resources across the country.
Iqbal, according to the statement, instructed the task force to organise a national AI workshop in collaboration with the Pakistan IT Industry Association (P@SHA) and other relevant industry bodies to provide a platform for dialogue between government, academia, and industry.
“It will focus on designing practical AI solutions tailored to Pakistan’s development context,” the statement read.
Last year, Iqbal inaugurated a three-day international conference on 3D printing and vacuum technology at the National Centre for Physics (NCP) at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, calling on scientists, researchers and innovators to work tirelessly to position Pakistan at the forefront of technological advancements.</p><small>2025-07-04 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/041540161d89df7.jpg?r=154635' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922074/body-of-liverpool-footballer-jota-arrives-in-portugal-for-hometown-wake' target='_blank'><strong>Body of Liverpool footballer Jota arrives in Portugal for hometown wake</strong></a><br><p>The bodies of Liverpool footballer Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva arrived in northern Portugal on Friday for a wake in their hometown, as tributes continued to pour in after they died in a car accident in Spain.
A convoy of hearses left for Gondomar near Porto on Thursday evening from the morgue of Puebla de Sanabria, near where the Lamborghini the brothers were travelling in had veered off the road and burst into flames after midnight early on Thursday. Police said they suspected a tyre had burst.
Jota’s wife Rute Cardoso, who had married the footballer just weeks earlier, was seen leaving the morgue and joining the convoy, as was Jota’s longtime agent Jorge Mendes.
A wake is expected to take place at a chapel in Gondomar from 4pm (8pm PKT) and a funeral on Saturday at a church nearby at 10am local time, Gondomar’s mayor’s office said.
Portugal’s Prime Minister Luis Montenegro arrived in the village on Friday morning.

The death of Jota at the age of 28 has jolted the world of football, with messages of homage pouring in from former teammates, clubs, national leaders and fans.
Outside Liverpool’s Anfield stadium fans left flowers, scarves and hand-written notes, many from children.
Football clubs including Paris St Germain, who have several Portuguese internationals in their squad, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Real Madrid observed a moment of silence during training for their matches in the Club World Cup taking place in the United States.
Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said on Thursday that forward Pedro Neto was weighing whether to play in Friday’s quarter-final against Palmeiras, as the Portuguese international mourns the tragic death of his close friend.
Jota’s manager at Liverpool, Arne Slot, said in a statement on Thursday that his thoughts were with his family.
“My message to them is very clear you will never walk alone,” Slot said.
“For us as a club, the sense of shock is absolute. Diogo was not just our player. He was a loved one to all of us. He was a teammate, a colleague, a workmate and in all of those roles he was very special,” he added.
 






Jota was making his way back to Liverpool by car after he was told he should avoid plane travel for up to 6 weeks following lung surgery to address a fractured rib, his physiotherapist Miguel Goncalves told broadcaster Now late on Thursday.
Goncalves said Jota was recovering well from the pneumothorax surgery and that he had planned to take a ferry to the UK from Spain.</p><small>2025-07-04 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612361-pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-boost-cooperation-in-trade-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan vow to boost cooperation in trade, investment</strong></a><br><p>

“The Israeli military’s current mission is to prepare an enforcement plan to ensure that Iran cannot threaten Israel again,” Katz said at a meeting with military leaders on Thursday, according to a statement released by his ministry.
“The army must prepare on the intelligence and operational level to ensure that the air force maintains air superiority over Tehran, the ability to enforce restrictions on Iran and prevent it from rebuilding its capabilities,” he added.
Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran on June 13 following a decades-long shadow war, saying it aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon — an ambition Tehran has consistently denied — and degrade its ballistic missile arsenal.
Following a US-announced ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to prevent Iran from ever rebuilding its nuclear facilities, raising the prospect of further conflict.
Katz wrote on X on June 27 that the army will “act regularly to thwart such threats”.
 






Israeli media say the country’s leaders are seeking a similar approach to the one it has adopted in Lebanon.
 
 

Its army regularly launches strikes on what it says are suspected Hezbollah militant positions and operatives in Lebanon despite a truce signed in November.
Israel has acknowledged being hit by more than 50 missiles during the 12-day war with Iran, resulting in 28 deaths, according to official figures.
In Iran, Israeli strikes killed more than 900 people, according to the country’s judiciary.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04130550b392824.jpg?r=131341' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922059/india-plans-230m-drone-incentive-after-pakistan-conflict-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>India plans $230m drone incentive after Pakistan conflict, sources say</strong></a><br><p>India will launch a $234 million incentive programme for civil and military drone makers to reduce their reliance on imported components and counter rival Pakistan’s programme built on support from China and Turkiye, three sources told Reuters.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
The nuclear-armed neighbours are now locked in a drones arms race.
New Delhi will launch a 20 billion Indian rupees ($234m) programme for three years that will cover the manufacture of drones, components, software, counter-drone systems, and services, two government and one industry source, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Details of the programme have not been previously reported and its planned expenditure is higher than the modest 1.2bn Indian rupees production-linked incentive scheme New Delhi launched in 2021 to promote drone start-ups, which have struggled to raise capital and invest in research.
India’s civil aviation ministry, which is leading the incentives programme, and the defence ministry did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment.
Reuters previously reported that India plans to invest heavily in local industry and could spend as much as $470m on unmanned aerial vehicles over the next 12 to 24 months, in what government and military officers said would be a staggered approach.
In the past, India has mainly imported military drones from its third-largest arms supplier, Israel, but in recent years its nascent drone industry has scaled up its cost-effective offerings, including for the military, although reliance on China continues for certain components such as motors, sensors and imaging systems.
 
 

Through the incentives, India is aiming to have at least 40 per cent of key drone components made in the country by the end of fiscal year 2028 (April-March), the two government sources said.
“During (the India-Pakistan) conflict there was quite a lot of use of drones, loitering munitions and kamikaze drones on both sides,” Indian Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said last week.
“The lesson that we’ve learned is that we need to double down on our indigenisation efforts to ensure that we build a large, effective, military drone manufacturing ecosystem.”
India bans import of drones but not their components and the government has planned additional incentives for manufacturers that procure parts from within the country, the two government sources said.
The state-run Small Industries Development Bank of India would also support the incentive programme by providing cheap loans for working capital, research and development needs for the firms, the government sources added.
Currently, there are more than 600 drone manufacturing and associated companies in India, according to estimates shared by an industry source involved in the discussions for the incentives programme.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04141310631ec5f.jpg?r=142530' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922068/pdma-issues-glof-warning-in-kp-amid-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>PDMA issues Glof warning in KP amid heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA)  warned on Friday that the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) has increased in the glacial areas of the province due to heavy rains and flash floods.
Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in Gilgit Baltistan and KP are vulnerable, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
In an advisory issued today, the PDMA warned that continuous increase in temperature increases the possibility of melting of glaciers and flash floods.
“The residents of Chitral, Dir, Swat and Kohistan have been instructed to remain alert about possible glacial outbursts. The district administration has been instructed to monitor sensitive areas, ensure timely warning and evacuation drills,” the disaster management agency said.
The PDMA has advised residents to avoid unnecessary movement near rivers and canals and refrain from taking vehicles into fast-flowing water. It also instructed tourists to remain alert and take precautionary measures.
The agency said evacuation sites have been set up in potentially affected areas and rescue services have been instructed to remain alert with required emergency equipment.
The National Highway Authority (NHA), Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and the Communication and Works Department (CWD) have been instructed to remain alert and take preventive measures for timely restoration of roads.
The PDMA has instructed district administration to take emergency measures in case of any untoward incident. District authorities have launched awareness campaign to inform the general public about measures to prevent possible losses.
“The PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre is fully functional. The public should contact 1700 for further information,” it added.
The advisory comes heavy rainfall and flash floods across the country that have killed 64 people and injured 117 in a week, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The highest toll was in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 23 dead, including 10 children, the authority said. Fourteen of the victims were swept away in a flash flood in the Swat Valley last week.
The PDMA has already warned district administrations across the province about the possibility of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides due to a new spell of monsoon rains from July 5 to 11.
In an advisory, the PDMA quoted the Pakistan Meteorological Department as revealing that moist currents are penetrating into most parts of the region and likely to intensify in the next couple of days.
It also said that urban flooding was very likely to happen in low-lying areas of Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan, while there’s a likelihood of riverine flooding in Chitral, Swat, Panjkora and Kabul rivers.
The PDMA said authorities should keep monitoring rivers, streams, local and rainfed nullahs, ensure drainage systems are clear from obstacles to facilitate the efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0411441127bfdf9.jpg?r=114425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922039/30-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-as-bid-to-infiltrate-via-pak-afghan-border-thwarted-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>30 terrorists killed in North Waziristan as bid to infiltrate via Pak-Afghan border thwarted: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Thirty terrorists of an “Indian proxy” outfit were killed as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read that on the nights of July 2 and July 3, “movement of a large group of khwarij, belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in general area Hassan Khel, North Waziristan district”.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term used by the government for the TTP, while those associated with the terrorist group are referred to as khaarji.
As per the ISPR, “all 30 Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell” as a result of the military’s “prices and skilful engagement” after the security forces foiled their attempt to infiltrate the border.
“A large number of weapons, explosives and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorists,” the statement added.
 






The ISPR appreciated the “exceptional professionalism, vigilance and preparedness” displayed by the security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe”.
The military’s media wing urged the Afghan government to “check and prevent the use of Afghan soil by ‘foreign proxies’ for orchestrating terrorist activities against Pakistan”.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for their bravery and reaffirmed the country’s “unwavering” resolve to curb terrorism.
“Security operations will continue until the terrorists are eliminated completely,” he said, according to a statement issued by the president’s office.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the operation, saying the “entire nation salutes the security forces”, in a statement reported by Radio Pakistan.
“The brave armed forces of Pakistan are standing like a solid wall to protect the country,” he asserted.
 






“Pakistan’s courageous security forces served as an unyielding shield to protect the nation,” the premier was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
“We are determined to eliminate all forms of terrorism from the country completely,” PM Shehbaz reaffirmed.
The engagement comes only days after security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.
In June, Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment recorded 78 militant attacks in June, compared to 85 in May.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612335-imran-directs-pti-to-begin-anti-govt-movement-after-10th-muharram-says-aleema' target='_blank'><strong>Imran directs PTI to begin anti-govt movement after 10th Muharram, says Aleema</strong></a><br><p>

“Iran remains committed to the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) and its Safeguards Agreement,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.
“The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbors anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.
 






On Wednesday, Iran officially suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, citing the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
In a post on X, Germany’s foreign office called on Iran to  “reverse this decision,” saying it sends a  “devastating message.”  “It eliminates any possibility of international oversight of the Iranian nuclear programme, which is crucial for a diplomatic solution,” it added.
 






Araghchi lambasted what he called Germany’s  “explicit support for Israel’s unlawful attack on Iran” on June 13, killing top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.
On June 17, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Israel was doing the  “dirty work… for all of us” by targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. The 12-day war between Iran and Israel saw it, along with the United States, launching unprecedented strikes Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz.
More than 900 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to the judiciary.
US sanctions
The US imposed sanctions on Thursday against a network that smuggles Iranian oil disguised as Iraqi oil, and on a Hezbollah-controlled financial institution, the Treasury Department said.
A network of companies run by Iraqi-British national Salim Ahmed Said has been buying and shipping billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil disguised as, or blended with, Iraqi oil since at least 2020, the department said.
“Treasury will continue to target Tehran’s revenue sources and intensify economic pressure to disrupt the regimes access to the financial resources that fuel its destabilising activities, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.
The US has imposed waves of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports over its nuclear programme and funding of groups across the Middle East.
Thursday’s sanctions came after the US carried out strikes on June 22 on three  Iranian nuclear sites, including its most deeply buried enrichment plant Fordow.
The Pentagon said on Wednesday the strikes had degraded Iran’s nuclear programme by up to two years, despite a far more cautious initial assessment that had leaked to the public.
The US and Iran are expected to hold talks about its nuclear programme next week in Oslo, Axios reported.
Said’s companies and vessels blend Iranian oil with Iraqi oil, which is then sold to Western buyers via Iraq or the United Arab Emirates as purely  Iraqi oil using forged documentation to avoid sanctions, Treasury said.
Said controls UAE-based company VS Tankers, though he avoids formal association with it, Treasury said. Formerly known as Al-Iraqia Shipping  Services & Oil Trading (AISSOT), VS Tankers has smuggled oil for the benefit of the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps, which is designated by Washington as a terrorist organisation, it said.
The sanctions block US assets of those designated and prevent Americans from doing business with them. VS Tankers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Iran’s mission in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US also sanctioned several vessels that are accused of engaging in the covert delivery of Iranian oil, intensifying pressure on Iran’s shadow fleet, it said.

The bill, when enacted, will overhaul the government’s Medicaid healthcare programme that covers around 71 million low-income Americans, introducing changes including mandatory work requirements that are expected to leave nearly 12 million people uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
Republicans have said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth. According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1tr. Much of those spending cuts come from Medicaid.
Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, an influential US doctors’ group, warned that the Medicaid cuts would limit access to care by leaving millions without health insurance and make it harder for them to see doctors.
“It will make it more likely that acute, treatable illnesses will turn into life-threatening or costly chronic conditions. That is disappointing, maddening, and unacceptable,” he said.
The Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents local, nonprofit health plans, also rebuked the bill’s passage, saying it would drive up consumer costs while slashing federal health spending to historic levels.
The group pledged to work with policymakers to minimise disruption for communities.
Greg Kelley, president of the Service Employees International Union’s healthcare branch, representing Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas, called the bill a “moral failure” that threatened healthcare access, jobs, and the stability of the healthcare system.
Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare programme at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said their research showed such cuts would hurt patient health. He said expanding Medicaid had saved lives and cutting it back was likely to have the opposite impact.
Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins health policy professor and adviser to the conservative Paragon Health Institute, said she expected the private market would step in as able-bodied adults lose Medicaid and subsidies.
“These people will come back to the private market,” she said. “The financial burden to purchase insurance will be shifted away from US taxpayers to these people’s shoulders.”</p><small>2025-07-04 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0407255113d1ba9.png?r=072621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921952/ndma-issues-monsoon-alert-from-july-6th' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues monsoon alert from July 6th</strong></a><br><p>• Flash flood risk in northern areas from July 7-12

Local authorities have been directed to ensure the readiness of response teams, drainage clearance and public awa­re­ness campaigns. Motorists have been warned to avoid driving through flooded roads and underpasses. Emergency services remain on high alert for potential rescue and evacuation operations.
 
 

The NDMA asked citizens to monitor its advisories and use the ‘Pak NDMA Disaster Alert’ app for real-time weather updates and safety information.
Punjab on high alert
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab has issued its own alert ahead of expected monsoon rains from July 5 to 10, warning of urban flooding and rising river levels.

A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali ordered the government to conduct an impartial and across the board operation for removing encroachments along the Swat River.
The bench was informed by head of three-member inquiry committee Khayyam Hassan Khan that they had visited Swat and had been probing the incident for the last four days.
He said that they had observed lapses on part of some of individuals and departments during flash floods in Swat and would highlight it in the report.

Committee head says he will highlight negligence by some individuals and depts

The bench was hearing two petitions related to the Swat incident of June 27, during which 13 persons stuck in gushing floodwater were killed near Fizzagut, Swat.
One of the petitions is filed by a lawyer Naeem Ahmad Khattak, seeking directives of court for respondents including government to take effective measures and remove obstacles/encroachments throughout KP near riverbeds.
 
 

Another petition is filed by a citizen, Amir Alam, for ordering a judicial inquiry into the ‘circumstances’ that led to deaths of several people during the floods in Swat as well as a probe into the alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles by the provincial government for ‘political’ purposes.
The petitioner has sought directives for law enforcement agencies and accountability authorities to look into alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles and resources by the provincial executive for political purposes and proceed strictly in accordance with law if cognisable offences were committed.
Advocates Babar Khan Yousafzai and Nasir Khan appeared for the petitioners, whereas KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel appeared for the government.
The chairman of the inquiry committee, Khayyam Hassan, also turned up along with some of divisional commissioners.
When the bench inquired who was the inquiry officer probing the incident, Mr Khayyam, the chairman of Provincial Inspection Team, informed the bench that provincial government had constituted the inquiry committee under his chairmanship.
He stated that the other two members of the committee were the inspector general of prisons, Mohammad Usman, and the director (admin) of excise and taxation department, Sheharyar Qamar. He said that according to the notification, the committee had to complete its probe within seven days.
Mr Khayyam said that according to terms of reference of the committee, they had to inquire into multiple aspects of the incident. He said that they were assigned to conduct thorough and impartial investigation into the flash flood incident, which had resulted into loss of precious lives.
He said that that they would assess and identify lapses or negligence on part of government functionaries and tourists. He said that they would also identify the individuals or institutions involved in any lapse regarding compliance of safety and fix responsibilities.
He said that they would put forward recommendations in order to avoid such tragic incidents in future and ensure strict adherence to safety measures.
Shah Faisal Uthmankhel informed the bench that government and administration in Swat had started an anti-encroachments drive along the Swat River that was facing certain hurdles.
The PHC chief justice observed that the court was aware that certain quarters would be exerting pressure in the drive. The bench directed him to continue with the operation without extending favour to any person.
The petitioners’ lawyers stated that government was having two helicopters and if it intended it could have saved lives of the deceased persons. The petitioners have also requested the court to issue directives for the respondents to cancel all mining activities, carried out through auction or otherwise, in the Swat River.
They said that the failure of Rescue 1122 and provincial authorities to respond timely and effectively caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of lives.

• Says absence of master plan led to disorganised, haphazard urban growth
• Mayor promises to include all relevant stakeholders in formation of new plan
KARACHI: The maiden meeting of the steering committee tasked to develop the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047 was informed on Thursday that the new master plan of the country’s commercial capital would be ready within two years.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani chaired the inaugural meeting of the high-powered body, which was also attended by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, director generals of the Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Development Authority, Malir Development Authority and Lyari Development Authority, Additional Chief Secretary-Local Government Waseem Shamshad, Senior Member Board of Revenue Baqaullah Unar, Planning & Development Secretary Sajjad Abbasi, Project Director Muhammad Arshad Khan, representatives of the project’s consulting firms and other officials.
 
 

The meeting was told that under the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, a comprehensive master plan for the city will be developed within the next two years by the local government department in collaboration with all stakeholders, civic agencies, and civil society organisations.
Participants of the meeting were briefed by the project director on the progress made so far on the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, while representatives of consulting companies involved also presented a comprehensive review of the Phase-I of the project.
‘No approved master plan’
Speaking on the occasion, LG Minister Ghani, who is also the chairman of the steering committee, said currently there is no approved master plan for Karachi.
He said that the absence of an approved master plan of Karachi has resulted in disorganised urban growth.
He said the government has started work to develop the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, an ambitious initiative aimed at monitoring the city’s future growth and resolving civic and infrastructural issues.
According to a press release issued after the meeting, he said the master plan aims to address illegal constructions and bring improvements across all key sectors of the metropolis, including water supply, sewerage, health, education, transport, infrastructure and commerce.
The minister said that the new master plan would serve as a crucial blueprint for the city’s development over the next two decades.
Previous plan expired in 2017, says mayor
Mayor Wahab told the meeting that the last master plan for the city was extended up to 2017. He said it had expired and the absence of a new master plan has caused difficulties across all sectors and led to the city’s unregulated expansion.
He expressed optimism that upon completion of this project and the formulation of the Master Plan 2047, it will be possible to better address Karachi’s infrastructure and public issues.
The mayor added that the Sindh government and the local government department were making all-out efforts to ensure that all relevant stakeholders who can play a vital role in the city’s and country’s progress are included in the formation of the plan.
It may be noted that six master plans have been prepared for Karachi in the 1923, 1948, 1952, 1974, 1991 and 2007. The last plan — Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020 — was prepared by the now defunct City District Government Karachi but it could not be fully implemented due to various reasons.

• Regrets how petition by death row prisoner received first hearing seven years after it was filed
• Criticises abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed regret over the inordinate delays plaguing the country’s criminal justice system, warning that such inefficiencies are eroding public confidence in the judiciary and amount to a form of “unauthorised punishment”.
In a detailed judgement, Justice Athar Minallah called for the urgent completion of appeal processes and said the abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country add to the unimaginable suffering of prisoners — especially those on death row. These conditions become “a form of unauthorised punishment not intended by the legislature”, he wrote.
He emphasised that it was the constitutional duty of every organ of the state — the executive, the judiciary and the legislature — to take urgent steps for ensuring that the criminal justice system serves the people of this country and they repose their trust and confidence in its fairness, impartiality and independence.
Justice Minallah presided over a three-member bench hearing the appeal of Tahir alias Tahri, who had challenged a 2014 Lahore High Court (LHC) decision upholding his conviction and death sentence for the murder of five individuals.
Justice Minallah observed that a weak and compromised criminal justice system undermines the rule of law and thus encourages corruption, authoritarianism and the rule of the powerful and privileged instead. “An effective and responsive criminal justice system, free from political interference and corruption, is a fundamental right of every citizen, while inexpensive and expeditious justice is a commitment of the state under the Constitution,” he wrote.
He conceded that judiciary was also responsible when the process of appeal exceeds the necessary and reasonable time required for its completion, but other branches of the state — the executive and legislature — were equally responsible for ensuring that the conditions in the prisons were humane and that the treatment of prisoners was not cruel, inhumane and degrading.
In the case at hand, Justice Minallah regretted that the appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court on Sept 3, 2008, and the appeal was preferred within time. The LHC decided the appeal on Sept 18, 2014, and the reference was answered in the affirmative, and thus, the sentence of death was confirmed.
But there was a six-year delay in deciding the appeal of a prisoner who has been handed down a death sentence, which cannot be justified when the necessary time for taking up the appeal and its ultimate disposal should not have been more than a year, Justice Minallah bemoaned.
The appellant had then sought leave by filing a petition before the Supreme Court, and the necessary and reasonable time required for its final disposal should not have been more than 12 months, he wrote.
The petition, which was filed in 2014, was fixed for hearing for the first time after seven years — on March 22, 2021 — and finally on Jan 29, 2025. It took more than 17 years to complete the appeal process from the date when the death sentence was handed down, the judgement regretted.
Throughout this time, the prisoner remained in a death cell, despite having no role in the delay nor any control over the procedural hurdles. Justice Minallah said such delays grossly exceed the “necessary and reasonable” time that should be required for appellate procedures.

Speaking at a press conference at KCCI, President Jawed Bilwani said the chamber, along with all seven industrial associations, would back any unified strike call against these provisions. “Posting banners and holding press conferences are just the beginning — protests will intensify until the government repeals Sections 37A and 37B entirely,” he warned.
Bilwani revealed that officials from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had contacted him to discuss the formulation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for implementing Section 37A. However, he categorically rejected any such proposals, stating, “In line with the unanimous demand of the business community, we reject SOPs and reiterate our sole demand: complete repeal of Section 37A.”
On the timeline for a potential strike, Bilwani said a final decision would be made following meetings with other chambers, trade bodies, and relevant stakeholders.

Demand repeal of Sections 37A and 37B; caution against investor exodus and rising protests

Criticising the sweeping arrest powers granted to FBR officials under the contentious provisions, he said these laws undermine Pakistan’s reputation as a business-friendly destination and risk scaring off both local and foreign investors.
“Section 37A is incompatible with doing business in Pakistan,” he said, adding that KCCI continues to receive complaints from business owners concerned about the psychological pressure and constant threat posed by these sections.
Bilwani stressed that the law unfairly targets already compliant taxpayers rather than addressing root causes of tax evasion. “Only 40pc of Pakistan’s economy is documented, of which barely 2pc may be involved in malpractice — yet 98pc of tax-compliant businesses are now subject to harassment,” he said. He added that the focus should be on those issuing fake or flying invoices, not those already in the tax net.
Highlighting the FBR’s poor enforcement record, he said most court verdicts in such cases have favoured taxpayers, with only a small fraction decided in favour of tax authorities.
KCCI has identified 30 anomalies in the tax framework, with five or six deemed critical enough to make return filing practically impossible. These, Bilwani stressed, need immediate rectification through urgent legislative amendments.
Businessmen Group Chairman Zubair Motiwala echoed Bilwani’s concerns, warning that unchecked arrest powers would lead to widespread harassment and open the door to corruption. “Officials vested with arrest powers may misuse them for personal gain, forcing law-abiding taxpayers to comply with unlawful demands just to safeguard their dignity,” he said.
He urged the government to target those outside the tax net rather than burdening the already documented segment.

“Minus Imran Khan is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?”
Ms Khan made the clarification while speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail after not being allowed to meet her brother on Thursday.
“Who’s doing the minus? Who’s in pain? If [the] government is not afraid, Imran Khan should not be in jail.”
She claimed her words were taken out of context by the media, adding that her brother remains open to any political resolution, but on his own terms.

Says her brother wants to negotiate with those who ‘Trump spoke to’

She then pivoted to her brother’s position on dialogue, saying he would only negotiate with Pakistan’s powerful establishment — the same officials she said US President Donald Trump has engaged with.
“Imran said that we should talk to those whom Donald Trump has been talking to,” Aleema said. “Trump knows that the current government cannot take decisions and there is martial law in the country.”
Another member of Mr Khan’s family, Noreen Niazi, reinforced the message, saying: “Imran Khan will only talk to those with whom Trump talked.”
When a reporter countered, saying that those in power have asked Mr Khan to speak with the government, Ms Khan was dismissive. “Why? When they don’t have any power and they know they are lost and dragged, Imran Khan will only talk to those with whom Trump spoke,” she said.
In the past, the PTI founder had signalled his willingness to negotiate with powerful quarters, but military figures repeatedly rebuffed his overtures. Famously, the military’s chief spokesperson demanded an apology over the events of May 9, 2023, when his supporters attacked military installations after his initial arrest.
But Mr Khan has refused, instead demanding the return of what he called his “stolen mandate”, and the provision of CCTV evidence to prove his party’s involvement in the targeting of military installations on May 9.
Aleema Khan had sparked controversy last month by claiming that her brother had been sidelined, following the unexpected passage of the KP budget.
“I think so he has been minused,” she had said when questioned whether Mr Khan had been excluded from the decision-making process over the provincial budget.
This was interpreted by many as an allegation against elements within the party. But on Thursday, she sought to dispel this impression.
She claimed she was only delivering Imran Khan’s message for members “playing on both sides”, suggesting that the PTI founder understood the pressure they faced, but expected them to stand firm or step aside.
She also expressed frustration with the PTI leadership for failing to organise protests outside the jail.

The designations, announced by the State Department and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), target a network of shipping and management firms accused of helping Iran covertly move oil and petrochemicals in violation of US sanctions.
The latest measures come weeks after Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and reflect Washington’s resolve to enforce the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” policy.
“The Treasury will continue to target Tehran’s revenue sources and intensify economic pressure to disrupt the regime’s access to the financial resources that fuel its destabilizing activities,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a statement.
 
 

Among those sanctioned is SAI Saburi Consulting Services, a New Delhi-based company that served as the commercial manager of two LPG tankers, BATELEUR and NEEL.
According to the Treasury, in September 2022, BATELEUR transported petroleum products from Iran on behalf of Alliance Energy Co., a previously sanctioned entity.
Alliance Energy Pvt Ltd, based in Lahore, Pakistan, was also sanctioned for its role in the Iranian oil trade. The company had already been blacklisted for violating US sanctions.
Other entities targeted include UAE, Iran and Panama-based firms and the vessels they operate.

The plan is subject to approval by both parties involved in the conflict. US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have been working to secure agreement.
According to an official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the plan includes provisions for negotiation on a permanent end to hostilities in the Palestinian territory.
Under the current draft, 10 Israeli prisoners would be returned along with the bodies of 18 others, according to the following schedule: Day 1: 8 prisoners — Day 7: 5 bodies — Day 30: 5 bodies — Day 50: 2 prisoners — Day 60: 8 bodies.  The swaps will take place without any ceremonies or parades.
On Day 10, Hamas would be expected to provide information and evidence that confirm which remaining prisoners are alive or dead, plus medical reports.
In turn, Israel will provide full information about Palestinian prisoners from Gaza detained since October 7, 2023.
As per practice, Hamas will release prisoners in exchange for Israel releasing detained Palestinians.
 
 

Israel says that of the 50 prisoners held by Hamas and its allies, about 20 are believed to be alive.
In addition, aid will immediately enter Gaza in sufficient amounts with the involvement of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with a January 19 agreement.
After the first eight Israeli prisoners are released, the Israeli army will withdraw from parts of northern Gaza as per maps that will be agreed upon.
On the seventh day, Israelis will withdraw from parts of the south.
A technical team will work on drawing boundaries for withdrawals during rapid negotiations that will take place after agreement on the framework of the proposal.
Negotiations will also start on a permanent ceasefire with key points that include: Remaining prisoner exchanges, long-term security arrangements for Gaza, and the declaration of a permanent ceasefire. If an agreement is reached, all remaining Palestinian prisoners detained from Gaza since October 7, 2023, will be released.
The proposal guarantees US President Donald Trump’s commitment to the agreement. If negotiations during the 60-day ceasefire are successful, they will lead to a permanent end to the conflict. The mediators will guarantee serious negotiations take place during the pause.

Moscow’s special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told the state news agency Ria Novosti that the government had “recognised” the Taliban.
In a statement issued after it accepted the credentials of a new ambassador from Kabul, the foreign ministry said the move would give impetus to the development of productive bilateral cooperation between our countries in various fields.
No other country has formally recognised the Taliban government that seized power in August 2021 after US-led forces staged a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war.
However, China, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Pakistan have all designated ambassadors to Kabul, in a step towards recognition.
The Russian move represents a major milestone for the Taliban administration as it seeks to ease its international isolation.
It is likely to be closely watched by Washington, which has frozen billions in Afghanistan’s central bank assets and enforced sanctions on some senior leaders in the Taliban that contributed to Afgha­nis­tan’s banking sector being largely cut off from the international financial system.
In April of this year, Russia’s top court had suspended the ban on the Afghan Taliban and removed its designation as a terrorist organisation.
At the time, the move was seen as a step towards Moscow normalising ties with the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.
Recently, shared security interests — including the fight against the so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) have drawn Russia and the Taliban closer.
Reacting to the development, Afghanistan’s foreign minister said on Thursday that Russia’s decision to become the first country to recognise their government was a “brave decision”.
“This brave decision will be an example for others… Now that the process of recognition has started, Russia was ahead of everyone,” Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a video of a meeting with Dmitry Zhirnov, the Russian ambassador to Kabul, posted on X.

• ANP’s application for proportional allocation of seats referred to election commission for further action
PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Thursday vacated its stay order on the oath-taking of MPAs on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, a move which would boost the stre­ngth of opposition parties in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
The court had granted a stay order on the petition of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), formed by former PTI leader and KP chief minister Pervez Khattak, and stopped the speaker from administering oath to MPAs-elect on reserved seats.
 
 

On Thursday, a two-member PHC bench, comprising justices Syed Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal, resumed the hearing on PTI-P application and a similar plea filed by ANP.
The petitioners had sought directives for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to recalculate their share of reserved seats in proportion to their general seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
They had requested the court to set aside two notifications issued by the ECP on Mar 4, 2024, notifying the names of returned candidates of different political parties on seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
Both PTI-P and ANP claimed they were allocated one seat each out of the total 26 seats reserved for women, whereas not a single seat was allotted to them against the four seats reserved for non-Muslims.
They claimed that they were entitled to three seats each for women and one seat each for non-Muslims.
ECP special secretary Mohammad Arshad informed the bench that PTI-P had earlier submitted a similar application to the commission but it was turned down.
He stated the party then challenged the issue before the Islamabad High Court, where the matter was still pending.
The bench questioned PTI-P’s counsel about how the plea could be filed in the PHC when the issue had already been challenged in the Islamabad High Court.
Advocate Sultan Mohammad Khan stated the petition was filed by the PTI-P parliamentary leader, Arbab Mohammad Waseem, who was unaware of the pending litigation in the IHC.
After a short break in the proceedings, Advocate Khan informed the court his client wanted to withdraw the petition.
Subsequently, the bench dismissed the petition and recalled its stay order granted on July 1.
ANP’s petition
Meanwhile, Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai, who appeared on behalf of ANP, said the party has also challenged the allocation of reserved seats.
He said the party has two general seats in the KP Assembly and under the system of proportional representation of allocation of reserved seats, it was entitled to three seats reserved for women and one for non-Muslims.
The ECP special secretary contended ANP’s case was “different” as it won a single seat in the February 8, 2024, general election and then another in a by-election.
He stated that the reserved seats were allocated on the basis of seats won by a political party in the general election.
The ECP official added that if seats were allocated on the basis of by-election results, it would result in complications and disrupt the existing process. The bench referred ANP’s plea to the ECP with directives to decide the matter within 10 days.
Last year, the ECP had allocated 10 seats reserved for women to JUI-F, eight to PML-N, six to PPP and one each to ANP and PTIP.
Similarly, two seats reserved for non-Muslims were allotted to JUI-F and one each to PML-N and PPPP.
The number of seats held by opposition parties in the KP Assembly is expected to jump from 27 to 52 following the Constitutional Bench’s decision to render the PTI ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.
The judgement, issued last month, restored several March 2024 notifications of the ECP declaring 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to reserved seats in the provincial assembly.
Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, who were elected as independents, while the 25 reserved seats were vacant.
On Wednesday, the ECP allocated reserved seats in the Punjab and Sindh assemblies, boosting the tallies of all major political parties, except the PTI.

The observation came during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Commit­tee on Climate Change, held at the National Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) He­­ad­quarters, where lawmakers received a briefing on the cou­ntry’s evolving disaster landscape and climate-induced chal­lenges.
Chaired by MNA Munaza Hassan, the sitting underscored that the country was ranked among the most climate vulnerable and water-scarce nations in the world. 
Members of the committee expressed concern that provincial and district authorities remained under-resourced to act on the NDMA’s warnings. 

Standing Committee on Climate Change stresses need for better coordination

“Empowering provincial and district authorities with better federal support is non-negotiable,” said Ms Hassan. 
She proposed mobilising overseas Pakistanis for both funding and volunteer response. The committee also recommended stronger coordination between NDMA and elected representatives on disaster warnings and relief.
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik presented the Authority’s Disaster Cale­ndar 2025 and plans which integrated forecasts of floods, heat waves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), and sea level rise. 
Drawing on 300 satellite feeds and an in-house Global Glacier Monitoring Portal, NDMA highlighted its early warning systems, the Integ­rated National Search and Rescue (INSaR) platform, and training initiatives of over twomillion responders. 
Yet, the committee lamen­ted that provincial and district authorities often lacked capacity. “We need a federal response framework to back up the PDMAs’ actions on the ground,” Ms Hassan stressed.
The committee was infor­med that NDMA had identified prime sites for rainwater reservoirs but provincial land acquisition delays were stalling progress. Members also raised concerns over sea water intrusion in Sindh and flood and erosion damage in district of Layyah calling for a national strategy beyond provincial jurisdictions.
The meeting was attended by MNAs Musarrat Asif Kha­waja, Syeda Shehla Raza, Sha­gufta Jumani, Rana Ansar, Ghu­lam Muhammad, Mus­sa­rat, Rafique Mahesar, Sahib­zada Sibghatullah, Shahzada Muhammad Gushtasap Khan, Awais Haider Jakhar and Ayesha Nazir along with Ministers of Water Resources, Science and Technology, Energy and National Food.
