The event took place at the Forest, Parks, and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, with numerous outfitters and hunters participating in the bidding, during which the department auctioned permits for the trophy hunting of four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibexes, and 14 blue sheep.
The second-highest permit for an Astore markhor sold for $286,000, while the top permits for a blue sheep and a Himalayan ibex went for $40,000 and $13,000, respectively.
“This is a record for the highest markhor hunting permit bid in the world and in Pakistan,” GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife Khadim Abbas told Dawn.

Top permit for Astore markhor sold for $370,000

He noted that the previous highest-priced permit in Pakistan was auctioned by the Khyber Pak­h­tunkhwa wildlife department in Chitral last year for $271,000.
Shikar Safaris Owner Raja Farhad Maqpoon placed the winning $370,000 bid for a permit in the Nanga Parbat conservancy area.
The other two Astore markhor permits sold for $270,000 and $240,000. The highest bids for both the blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits were won by M Ali Nagri of Markhor Safaris.
For the upcoming season, the department raised the base price for an Astore markhor permit to $200,000, up from $150,000 last year.
The base prices for blue sheep and Himalayan ibex were set at $30,000 and $10,000, up from $9,000 and $5,500, respectively. In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor was $161,000.
However, some local outfitters and tour operators argued the sharp fee hikes are discouraging international clients and could harm their businesses.
“If the true spirit of conservation is replaced with short-term financial gains for local communities, the model will lose its foundation and is likely to collapse within a few years, leaving both wildlife and communities at a greater loss,” said Ikram Baig, president of the GB Association of Tour Operators.
The trophy hunting programme in Gilgit-Baltistan was launched in 1990 and is credited with helping protect endangered species.
Under the programme, local communities receive about 80 percent of the revenue from hunting permits to be used for conservation and development projects. Stakeholders now fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

The committee also suggested placing the authority under the Finance Division rather than the Cabinet Division.
During discussions on the government’s Virtual Assets Bill 2025, PMLN Senator Afnanullah Khan accused the Secretary of Law of plagiarism. He claimed that he had originally tabled the bill, which was later “copy-pasted” by the Ministry of Law and introduced as the government’s version.
“This is shameful,” he said, adding that the government’s draft was identical to the one he had proposed, which had been opposed by the government earlier.
 






Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, criticised the practice of the government claiming credit for draft laws initially proposed by members. He pointed out that such instances had occurred multiple times in the past, with the government only acting when parliamentarians introduced new bills. Senator Dilawar Khan likened the situation to someone claiming ownership of Mirza Ghalib’s poetry.
Secretary of Law Raja Naeem Akbar denied having seen Mr Khan’s private member bill until the Senate panel provided it. However, Senator Afnanullah maintained that the law minister had seen and opposed his bill when it was first introduced. He proposed a privilege motion in the Senate, accusing the Law Secretary of misleading Parliament by claiming the bill was never presented.

Recommends barring PVARA members from trading; proposes placing authority under Finance Division

The committee also recommended setting eligibility criteria for members and the chairman of PVARA, including a minimum of five years of experience and an age limit of 55 years. Senator Afnanullah suggested stronger safeguards for data privacy, and proposed that service providers be held accountable for privacy violations.
 
 

Senators Mandviwalla and Mohsin Aziz raised concerns over the $10,000 limit on virtual asset transactions, suggesting that there should be no such cap if the government is determined to regulate virtual assets.
The government had issued a presidential ordinance on July 8 to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and service providers. The regulator will have comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, and prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing, in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
PVARA’s board will include key government figures such as the State Bank’s governor, and the secretaries of finance, law, and information technology, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and Digital Pakistan Authority. Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance, or technology will also be appointed by the federal government.
 
 

Under the bill, any person or company wishing to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by PVARA. The bill outlines a structured licensing regime with specific requirements for operational capacity, compliance frameworks, and reporting obligations.
The bill aims to ensure investor protection, promote transparency, and foster innovation in the virtual asset market.
The government has also ensured that the regulatory framework will be compatible with Islamic finance principles by mandating the creation of a Sharia Advisory Committee to advise PVARA on Sharia compliance for virtual asset products and services.

The US-based Muslim Charity Helping Hand for Relief and Development (HHRD), largely run by Pakistani Americans, spent the day on Capitol Hill, highlighting the urgent need for food, clean water, medical assistance, and long-term rehabilitation for millions of people affected by the floods.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, described the floods as “an unprecedented disaster that has set back economic growth, and continues to cause devastation across the country”.
Warning that next year’s monsoon could arrive earlier and bring even greater devastation, he called Pakistan “a frontline state” in the fight against climate change.
“Governments will do what they can, but all should come forward and help. The world must form a collective strategy to deal with recurring disasters,” he said.

Pakistani Americans highlight urgent need for food, clean water, medical aid and rehabilitation for millions hit by floods

The HHRD also announced dedicating an initial $5 million for relief and rehabilitation work and pledged to expand its efforts. The Pakistani community is holding fundraising events across the United States and Canada to supplement the relief efforts.
HHRD officials told lawmakers that the floods have directly affected more than five million people, with over 20 million at risk, underscoring the urgency of global support. Since late June, torrential rains and flash floods have battered Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The floods have killed 881 people, injured more than 1,100, destroyed 11,000 homes, and damaged 250 bridges and 415 miles of roads. Some 1.2 million hectares have been submerged, including 853,000 hectares of cropland.
A UN report, released on Wednesday, warned that “the situation remains highly fluid, with reservoirs at full capacity and heavy rainfall forecast in early September, cautioning that new surges along the Chenab and other rivers could impact downstream districts in South Punjab”.
HHRD officials said their teams have been providing mobile clinics, water filtration systems, search-and-rescue operations, cooked meals, hygiene kits, mosquito nets, milk, and “Smile Boxes” for children. By early September, their relief teams had reached over 62,000 people across 13 districts, including Lahore, Sialkot, Swat, Neelum Valley, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials emphasised that this initial $5m is a starting point and that the organisation intends to expand its reach in the coming weeks and months.
Ambassador Sheikh also highlighted the proactive spirit of Pakistanis, noting that citizens often take initiative in disaster response without waiting for government intervention.
Published in Dawn, September 4th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-04 04:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/040858296ddd569.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939549/supreme-court-bar-association-for-open-hearing-of-plaints-against-judges' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court Bar Association for open hearing of plaints against judges</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As the scheduled full court meeting of the top court is fast approaching for giving a final approval to the Supreme Court Rules, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has proposed open inquiries into complaints by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against superior court judges.
In a set of proposals, the SCBA highlighted that open hearings will not only ensure internal accountability but also reaffirm the constitutional guarantee of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution.
Once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should conduct open proceedings subject to reasonable safeguards of dignity and decorum while deciding references within a fixed timeframe, preferably six months.
The 12-page set of proposals seeking to amend the SC Rules-2025 was furnished by SCBA President Mian Mohammad Rauf Atta and senior advocate Hafiz Ehsan Khokhar and were made known to the media at a press conference on Wednesday.

Set of proposals made public ahead of SC full court meeting

Considering the adverse reaction by the top lawyer’s bodies including the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and SCBA, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to suggest recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to provisions of the new rules.
The proposals will be taken up by the full court on Sept 8.
The written proposals request immediate withdrawal of recent increase in court fees, setting up a timeline for lawyers representing different parties to present arguments, deciding every case filed in the Supreme Court within a year, issuing orders of court proceedings the same day and reserved decisions within a month.
According to the set of proposals, suggestions were made to ensure the implementation of legal provisions under Articles 4, 10A, 25, and 37(d) that guarantee equality before law, fair trial, and the right to inexpensive and expeditious justice.
It was noted that as SC’s sanctioned strength has been enhanced to 35 judges, including the CJP, this moment presents a unique opportunity for structural reforms.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees, stating the recent increase in court fees should be withdrawn to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany where only nominal fees were charged.
One of the proposals deals with the right of audience for counsel by ensuring uninterrupted opportunities for lawyers to present their case, similar to structured models in Norway, France and Germany, while another asked for increase in working hours and urgent benches of the court as practised in India, the UK and the US.
The right of access to justice enshrined in Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution requires not merely the availability of judicial forums but also their effective and timely functioning, it was emphasised.
The pendency of cases before the SC that had reached unprecedented levels demands innovative approa­ches to maximise court’s productivity. One effective reform would be the extension of working hours for hearings and the creation of “late benches” dedicated to urgent matters such as bail, human rights petitions, election disputes and stay ap­­plications. Comparative practices il­­lustrate that this model has proven highly effective in other jurisdicti­o­­ns, the proposal said, adding the Su­­p­reme Court of India regularly constitutes vacation benches and late benches to address urgent relief during recess and after-hours sittings.
For Pakistan, the adoption of extended hours and urgent benches would not only address the backlog but also reinforce public confidence in the judiciary’s responsiveness, thereby fulfilling the constitutional promise that justice will be administered without delay or denial.
Another proposal stated the Arti­c­les 175 and 184 envisioned the Sup­r­e­me Court as the apex judicial auth­ority, with mandate to adjudicate ma­­tters of constitutional, tax, civil, criminal, and regulatory importan­­ce.
On cause list and adjournment of cases, the proposal asked for adopting India’s continuous listing and China’s AI-driven scheduling to curb adjournments.
It asked for the issuance of short orders the same day followed by detailed reasons, consistent with the practice in Germany, Turkiye, and France.
About digitisation, it asked for e-filing, online tracking, and automation modelled on systems in Singapore, China, and Norway.

The remarks were made during a press conference, where leaders of the political alliance criticised the government’s response to a natural disaster affecting numerous districts.
“Punjab is also facing severe floods, but the provincial government has completely failed,” said TTAP Secretary General Asad Qaiser, who was joined by Salman Akram Raja, Raja Nasir Abbas and others.
“Instructions have been passed that relief activities cannot be done without pictures of Maryam Nawaz. Only media campaign is going on and no relief has been provided.”

TTAP accuses officials of using relief efforts to run media campaign for CM

Mr Qaiser, stating that he also belongs to a flood-affected area, spoke of the human toll of the disaster. “I also belong to areas affected by flood and know a house in which 13 family members died,” he said.
He called for a comprehensive plan to build small dams and suggested that an emergency be declared. Mr Qaiser also blamed illegal housing societies for flooding in Lahore and urged the government to re-launch the Billion Tree Tsunami project to prevent disasters in future.
He contrasted the current situation with the 2022 floods, claiming the former PDM government sought international funds but failed to act. He also alleged the current Punjab government was preoccupied with social media.
“Punjab government was busy on TikTok and was doing nothing,” Mr Qaiser said, noting that livestock was suffering without care while officials were making visits to Japan instead of supporting the people.
 
 

Salman Akram Raja, who also spoke at the conference, warned of economic consequences. He said destroyed crops would lead to higher prices for rice and wheat.
“The import-export gap has been increasing due to which inflation will increase,” Mr Raja said.

This combination of growth with inflation portends trouble because it is a sign that the economy is trying to serve levels of demand that its productive apparatus is not capable of meeting.
Over-extraction is something similar, but on the opposite end of the spectrum. This is when a state tries to extract for itself resources from an economy that the productive apparatus is not able to supply. And that is where we have reached in Pakistan. We are now in a situation where the state is trying to extract dollars and revenues from an economy in quantities that the productive apparatus cannot supply.
 
 

Consider the state’s growing appetite for dollars. One data series illuminates this. Look at the net foreign assets, or NFAs, in the State Bank’s monetary data series. This data measures the total foreign currency liquidity in the system. You’ll notice three entries. One tells you how much of the NFA is held by the State Bank. The second tells you how much is held by commercial banks. And the third entry is the total.
Notice that total NFAs are negative for a long time. Start from July 2023, when they are negative Rs1.7 trillion, and notice how the line moves in one long, slow, agonising upward trajectory, pock-marked with dips along the way, until it finally breaks into positive territory on the last day of March 2025. This long, slow, agonising climb out of negative territory is one of the two key elements of what they call ‘stabilisation’, because so long as NFAs are negative, it means the foreign currency liabilities on the system are larger than the assets.

The state is trying to extract more revenues, and more dollars from an economy that is not able to supply these.

It took years for this figure to break out above the x-axis of the graph, and the journey was marked with strong devaluation of the rupee, strangulation of imports, sharp curbs on cross-border payments, administrative measures on land border crossings, threats and cajoling for money changers and incentives for banks to rake in more remittances through formal channels. In short, it took nearly the full might of the state and central bank, for well over 20 months, to pull this line up from its low point back then to positive territory today.
 
 

Now look at the series for NFAs held by the State Bank. Notice how it breaks out above zero back in August 2024 and keeps rising from that point, suffering a few setbacks along the way in late December and early January. By June 2025, it hits a peak of Rs657 billion. Not bad considering its journey began from negative Rs883bn back in June 2023, on the eve of the stabilisation programme. That’s an increase of Rs1.5tr.
Notice how in June this figure drops suddenly back into negative territory, then leaps out of it the next week to a new peak of Rs968bn. This is a sudden outflow due to repayment of a Chinese bond, followed by an equally sudden inflow due to a rollover, so the same liquidity flows out of the system with the repayment and back in again once the rollover is finalised from the Chinese side.
Then look at what happens after that. State Bank NFAs rise massively to Rs1.45tr, and remain stable more or less at the level till today. Meanwhile, NFAs held by private banks plunge, falling from negative Rs353bn when the rollover happens to negative Rs741bn today.
Once plotted on a graph, these three lines will tell a stark story of how all the foreign exchange that flowed into the country once the current account was stabilised with great pain and sacrifice somewhere in the early months of 2023 was then bought and stashed away by the central bank in order to build its reserves. And this frenzied buying is being carried out at a price dictated by the government.
The fact that NFAs of scheduled banks remain negative through all this entire period as the State Bank’s assets rise to levels not seen for years tells us that the state is basically taking all the foreign exchange flowing into the country for itself. And the data shows that this process is intensifying from May 2025 onwards.
This helps explain the rising pressures on the exchange rate in these months. It also helps explain why maybe exporters are holding back export proceeds in anticipation of a potential exchange rate devaluation.
 
 

It also helps us understand why money changers were called in one more time a few weeks ago and told to stop trying to sell their dollars in the black market. It helps us understand why the State Bank is not cutting interest rates even though inflation has fallen to historic lows. It also helps explain the large spread between the price of the dollar in the interbank market versus the hundi or hawala market, which probably reflects the true price more accurately.
We hit peak stabilisation somewhere in the early months of 2025. From there, we have now moved into over-extraction mode. The state is trying to extract more revenues, and more dollars from an economy that is not able to supply these. At least not as presently constituted. So the state resorts to heightened coercive measures, which is what gives the whole enterprise the look of extraction. This is no longer the pursuit of macroeconomic stability that we are in. This is now a state bleeding its own economy to feed its appetites.
The balance-of-payments crisis that Pakistan faced in the summer of 2022 is what happens when you gun an overheating economy to grow harder and faster. The present juncture is what you get when you try to extract dollars and revenues from a stagnant economy. We have gone from overheating to over-extraction. And the only way out is to either reform, or find an external bailout.

• Move to have family courts hear polygamy cases gets full court nod
ISLAMABAD: Despite strong resistance from senior judges, a full court meeting of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adopted the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025.
The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two  judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
According to the agenda, the full court had been convened to deliberate on three key issues: amendments to the law related to polygamy, structural flaws in the IHC building, and the adoption of the service rules.
The meeting was attended by all 11 judges, including Chief Justice Sardar Moham­mad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Jus­tice Tariq Mehmood Jahan­giri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ish­aq Khan, Justice Khadim Hus­sain Soomro, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, Justice Moham­mad Azam Khan, Jus­t­ice Moham­mad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
Polygamy law, building flaws
Sources said the full court unanimously approved the amendment to the polygamy law, under which such cases will now be tried by family courts instead of executive magistrates.
It also decided to refer the IHC building case to the federal government for a thorough investigation into persistent issues. An inquiry conducted by the public works department earlier pointed out several defects in the elevators.
The inquiry report noted that the elevators lacked certain features promised in the prototype and the specifications, but it failed to identify those responsible for the fau­lty installation and maintenance.
Apart from the elevators, the IHC building continues to suffer from multiple problems, including an ineffective cooling system and inadequate parking facilities for litigants and lawyers.
The judges observed that instead of referring the matter directly to the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency, the federal government should be asked to carry out a comprehensive probe and take corrective measures.
CJ’s powers
Unlike these two agenda items, the proposed IHC Rules, 2025 triggered  a sharp division among the judges. While the chief justice strongly supported them, senior judges, including Justice Kayani, Justice  Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Imtiaz, opposed their adoption and urged amendments.
A day before the meeting, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had written letters to their colleagues, voicing serious concerns that administrative powers were being misused to sideline dissenting judges.
 
 

Both judges strongly objected to a new circular requiring judges to obtain a No-Objection Cert­ificate (NOC) from the chief justice for foreign travel.
They alleged that case assignments were being manipulated to benefit judges transferred to the IHC alongside the chief justice, while permanent judges who had opposed his transfer were being sidelined.
The letters also challenged the chief justice’s use of the “master of the roster” power to transfer part-heard cases.
Justice Khan also took exception to the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR), reminding his colleagues that PPR had already been gazetted without approval or even proper discussion by the full bench.
He noted the voluminous document, spanning more than 600 pages, had been provided only a day and a half before the meeting, reducing consultation to a mere formality and making meaningful input impossible.
Justice Khan dem­anded that five additional agenda items, including these objections, be formally taken up for “proper deliberations” in the full court meeting, signalling his refusal to let the controversy be ignored.
Voting and objections
According to sources, Chief Justice Dogar rejected any alteration in the agenda and proceeded to call a vote.
Six judges, including the chief justice, approved the rules, while five opposed them and resolved to record their objections in writing.
During the proceedings, the dissenting judges questioned whether those voting in favour had even read the new rules. The response, sources claimed, was negative.
Some judges, noting the massive length of the document, requested the chief justice to postpone the meeting, but their plea was turned down. Ultimately, the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were adopted by a razor-thin majority, leaving the full court deeply divided.

This is a welcome step considering the increasing use, application, availability and risks of AI in technology-related sectors, as well as the increased societal use of it. Whereas the policy outlines an ambitious plan related to AI in Pakistan, it can benefit with several additions, and the addressing of contextual realities including impact and risks that the plan does not acknowledge.
The AI policy created a National AI Fund (allocating 30 per cent of Ignite’s Research and Development fund), Centres of Excellence, an AI Council/Directorate, regulatory sandboxes and national compute/data infrastructure.
 
 

The policy prioritises sector pilots in health, education, agriculture and governance, plus public awareness. Targets include training up to one million professionals by 2030; 3,000 scholarships annually, paid internships and alignment with global standards on ethics, cybersecurity and data protection. Implementation will follow a master plan and action matrix overseen by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom.
The policymaking process was not inclusive, as a multi-stakeholder dialogue has not included cross-cutting segments of society, including environmentalists, civil society, digital rights experts, media and the healthcare and education sectors; and there is no transparency around the stakeholder engagement process.
Significantly, there is no legislative basis for taking these decisions, as no parliamentary debate (including in the IT committees) has taken place, other than the IT ministry formulating the policy through a nontransparent process.
For starters, the policy does not acknowledge the limitations in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure, including a jarring digital divide, which will impact the implementation of the AI policy equitably. For instance, there was a three-week mobile internet shutdown across Balochistan last month, and internet connectivity remains limited in several other parts of the country, including KP’s western districts.
 
 

The policy speaks of including AI in public school curricula, but thousands of schools across the country are devoid of functional computer labs. For instance, according to reports, 1,482 government-run schools in KP lack computer lab facilities. How then can AI be taught to students who do not even have access to computers?
Furthermore, the policy does not take into account the dynamic nature of AI and technology, and outlines no strategy on how curricula for AI in the education sector will be updated with changes in technology, something that may render earlier curricula obsolete.

The policy does not take into account the dynamic nature of AI and technology.

Whereas the policy mentions use of AI for the environment, it completely ignores the climate-related risks of AI data centres in Pakistan, which, besides being a water-scarce country is acutely vulnerable to the impact of climate change. A large data centre for AI can require up to 5m gallons of water per day — this is the daily amount needed for a town of around 50,000 people.
 
 

As Pakistan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, over 80pc of its population faces water scarcity. Therefore, any AI policy with proposals for local data centres should include a mandatory environmental impact assessment condition.
The AI policy includes plans for E-khidmat centres for public services, health, education, sanitation, energy, security and other government services through AI chatbots, smart reporting and centralised service delivery. This raises surveillance risks, especially in the face of the absence of a data protection regime. Further, overreliance on AI when people need assistance and interface with government officials will only mirror current portals and helplines where people never hear back.
There are significant rights implications of this policy, in particular relating to privacy rights and freedom of speech impacts. It is alarming that the policy has been formulated in the absence of a data protection regime in Pakistan as the Personal Data Protection Bill is yet to be passed; however, the AI policy refers to aspects of the bill despite the status of the law remaining unclear. If a strong data protection regime does not exist, it raises serious concern around privacy risks around the large language models that fuel AI systems.
 
 

Furthermore, the policy details how an AI directorate will be formed to provide regulatory guidelines to address “disinformation, data breaches and fake news”. It is necessary that such steps entail a robust and inclusive parliamentary process, as such language raises alarms related to freedom of expression.
The policy does not mention the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, which deals with issues such as disinformation and ‘fake news’ in its amended form as of February 2025, and the overlap that the work of this directorate may have with that of the Social Media Regulatory Authority that the Peca amendments proposed.
The Digital Rights Foundation in its analysis of the policy stresses the “serious questions around transparency, ethical safeguards and protecting marginalised communities from discrimination”, which is imperative considering the risks of discrimination that automated systems in AI pose. In the absence of provisions in the policy on human rights risk assessments, the human rights impact of AI systems in the country are likely to create new issues rather than address existing ones.
Relatedly, the policy includes proposals for special training programmes for women and persons with disabilities, but it does not address the expanded role AI is playing in technology-facilitated gender-based violence.
At an event on TFGBV, a Pakistani man noted that “previously men would throw acid at women to destroy their lives, but now men have to create an AI-generated video to destroy the life of a woman”. This shows the gendered risk that AI poses to Pakistani women and gender minorities in particular, and it should be reflected in the policy.
Lastly, whereas the AI policy addresses expanding AI systems in Pakistan and supporting innovation and education related to it, there need to be specific provisions around developing machine-learning models in languages most common in Pakistan so that reliance on foreign languages reduces and inclusive expansion of AI tools are available to speakers and readers of Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto, Seraiki, Balochi languages.

Over the past week, authorities in Punjab have destroyed several embankments to save major cities from being inundated. Naturally, the Sindh government has been facing queries about whether a similar strategy will be deployed in the province.
The swollen eastern rivers of Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej merge into the Indus River at Panjnad before entering Sindh, and the province faces a similar situation to the one it faced in September 2014.
The Indus River has already passed a medium and high flood through the Guddu and Sukkur barrages in July and August of this season.

Minister says Punjab’s strategy can’t be emulated downstream due to province’s peculiar topography

How much water will pass through Guddu now remains a guessing game, considering flow patterns at the barrage. The barrage passed a peak of 550,965 cusecs on Sept 1 — recorded at Trimmu first — from Punjab.
Officials remain unsure whether floodwaters from the Chenab would precede combined flows from the Ravi and Sutlej, which would accumulate at Panjnad before heading to Guddu.
With a discharge capacity of 865,000 cusecs against Trimmu’s 875,000, Panjnad is the second last destination before the tributaries merge into the mighty Indus.
Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, who is stationed at the Sukkur Barrage to monitor floods, told Dawn that breaches were not an option.
“There is no option of breach in our minds,” he said, adding that Sindh’s topography tells a different story when it comes to such decisions.
“Gradient in Sindh’s lands is lower than the Indus River,” he argued, while asking people not to worry about any possible breaches. “I tell those putting this query that we can’t breach a dyke. It’s not an option,” he assured.
Peculiar gradient
Explaining this phenomenon, Tando Jam Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Altaf Siyal said there were variables in the soil gradient in Punjab and Sindh and breaching a dyke was a different story for each province.
“A breach can be made on either side of the Indus. If it occurs on the right bank, the water will head westward because those pockets have large depressions. In case of a breach on the left bank, it will impact the Nara canal of Sukkur Barrage first before heading downstream,” Dr Siyal said.
A breach around Khairpur Mirs and Naushahro Feroze would send water to the river from the Qazi Ahmed side on the left bank of the Indus.
 
 

According to him, any breach on the right bank upstream of Sukkur will send water down to Manchhar Lake via the Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD)/Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD).
“Manchhar Lake then allows the authorities to redirect water to the Indus if the river flows remain on the lower side,” he said, alluding to the 2010 super floods.
In 2010, a massive breach 60km downstream of Guddu displaced millions after the Tori Bund developed a fissure, affecting seven districts on the right bank. The water eventually ended up in the lake.
In 2022, heavy rainfall in the Kirthar Range inundated parts of the right bank districts, including Qambar-Shahdadkot, Larkana, Dadu, and Jamshoro. These flows entered the Indus after Manchhar had to be breached the same month at two locations.
A high-powered judicial commission was formed to probe the causes of the 2010 flood breaches at Tori and Molchand-Surjani at Kot Almo in Thatta, downstream of Kotri Barrage, on Aug 27, 2010.
The report mentioned that around 1.47MAF water was released from Tori and 70pc of the 150km on Begari Sindh Feeder, an off-taking channel of Guddu Barrage on its right side was destroyed.
The chief engineer of the Guddu barrage and his team, along with the irrigation secretary, were held responsible for negligence.
Discharges in Punjab
Mr Jam and Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero also shared information about discharges recorded in Punjab, especially at Trimmu, Panjnad, Head Sidhnai over Ravi (with 157,580 cusecs discharge at 4pm Wednesday) and Sulemanki over Sutlej (122,736 cusecs). Chenab, in fact, passed a peak of 1,077,951 cusecs in the last week of August, which Sindh is now waiting for.
“Let’s see which peak reaches Guddu first. My hunch is that the time lag between barrages has increased,” he said.
Sutlej and Ravi are passing their peaks, too, and the water will head for Guddu while Indus water from Taunsa will also reach the first barrage in Sindh, adding to these discharges. Panjnad’s downstream flow was 217,447 cusecs at 6pm on Wednesday. These are the flows released from the Tarbela Dam built on the Indus.
Even the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) mentioned that 1.3m cusecs of water would reach Guddu Barrage, which has a capacity of 1.2m cusecs.
The irrigation secretary said that losses between the two reaches of the barrages needed to be factored in as well.
He also drew a parallel between this year and 2014’s Chenab flows. “A discharge of 947,000 cusecs downstream Khanki [over Chenab] on Sept 7 eventually turned out to be a flow of 453,570 cusecs at Panjnad on Sept 16 and 475,000 cusecs [inclusive of Indus flows] at Guddu on Sept 19.
He, however, assured that the government was prepared to deal with any situation involving a flow of 900,000 cusecs, considered a super flood.

His endorsement of the dam runs contrary to popular public opinion not just in Sindh and Balochistan but also in his own province.
Ostensibly contingent on addressing provincial reservations to the controversial hydropower project on the Indus, his support for the dam — opposed by the provincial assemblies of Sindh, KP and Balochistan in the not so distant past — has baffled his own party as well. PTI leaders from KP and Sindh quickly disowned his statements. Asad Qaiser said that Mr Gandapur’s statement did not reflect the party’s policy. “The party has always made it clear that there should not be any controversial project. At the moment, there is a need to strengthen the federation,” he said. Haleem Adil Sheikh called the proposal a “dead horse”, which the PTI never supported. The PPP, through Nisar Khuhro, reminded Mr Gandapur that three provinces had already closed the door on Kalabagh.
The irony, however, is that the PML-N’s government in Punjab — often viewed by other federating units as the force behind the project — found itself in rare agreement with Mr Gandapur, with its information minister rushing to countersign the CM’s reckless grandstanding on behalf of her party. It exposes deep provincial fault lines: what is seen as a necessity in Punjab is viewed as a sell-out by the other provinces.
 
 

Mr Gandapur’s support for the Kalabagh dam comes on the heels of a plea from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a recent visit to flood-hit Narowal district, for a consensus on new water reservoirs to fight the challenges of climate change and deal with the recurring floods.
While the move to bring up Kalabagh dam again risks opening old wounds, the cry for new reservoirs underpins how deeply our power elites are stuck in old, redundant concepts. As if we needed it, the effort to revive a defunct project is proof that our rulers are not capable of thinking beyond brick-and-mortar solutions to our worsening climate challenges. Is this because of lack of imagination or due to the massive money involved in such schemes, or both?
Pakistan, which is among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, desperately needs solutions to its problems of water shortages and droughts, devastating floods, erosion of the Indus delta, which is displacing local communities, and so on. These issues cannot be resolved by stopping the river flows through dams.
At a time when Pakistan needs unity more than ever, with floods wreaking devastation in several parts of the country and an economy on the brink, it is crucial that our rulers started to think beyond brick-and-mortar structures — if, indeed, they want to solve our increasing climate-related challenges.

• WFP says it has supplies, funds for only four weeks
KABUL/GENEVA: Afghanistan airdropped commandos on Wednesday to pull survivors from the rubble in areas ravaged by earthquakes that have killed more than 1,400 this week, as a United Nations agency warned that food aid for victims would run out soon without urgent funding.
Meanwhile, the UN refugee chief has called on Pakistan to pause its expulsion of Afghan refugees, as returns continued despite the weekend’s deadly quake.
The latest expulsions come as already impoverished Afghanistan responds to a devastating 6.0-magnitude  earthquake that wiped out villages along the border that were home to many recently expelled migrants.
More than 1,400 people were killed in the disaster. More than 1.2 million Afghans have been made to leave Pakistan since 2023, including more than 443,000 this year alone, according to the UN.
At the Chaman border crossing, “more than 4,000 people have left ever since the deadline ended”, local administrator Habib Bangulzai told AFP.
In Spin Boldak on the Afghan side, migrant registration official Abdul Latif Hakimi estimated that “250 to 300 families are returning” daily since August 31.
At the Torkham crossing further north, more than 6,300 PoR holders returned on Tuesday alone, according to authorities managing the terminal. They estimated that nearly 63,000 PoR cardholders have entered Afghanistan since April.
Afghan refugees, some awaiting relocation overseas, reported police raids as well as extortion and harassment by authorities in the lead-up to the latest deadline.
Search and rescue
Dozens of commando forces were being airdropped at sites where helicopters cannot land, to help carry the injured to safer ground, in what aid groups said was a race against time to rescue those still stuck under rubble.
Time was also running out for those who survived the two devastating quakes in the remote eastern region of the impoverished country, the World Food Progra­m­­me (WFP) warned on Wednesday.
John Aylieff, the head of WFP in Afghanistan, told Reuters that the agency only has enough funding and stocks for the next four weeks.
“Four weeks is just not enough even to meet the basic, essential needs of the population struck by the earthquake, let alone put the victims on a path back to rebuilding their lives,” Aylieff said.
The toll stands at 1,457 deaths, 3,394 injuries and more than 6,700 destroyed homes, the Taliban administration said. The UN has said the toll could rise, with people still trapped under rubble.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
Households wiped out
Entire households were wiped out in some villages in Kunar province, where the majority of casualties were reported from, with a dozen dead and hundreds hurt in nearby Nangarhar and Laghman provinces. Survivors sifted through rubble looking for families, carried bodies on woven stretchers and dug graves with pickaxes.
Access remained difficult, as aftershocks caused rockfall, stymying access to already isolated villages and keeping families outdoors for fear of the remains of damaged homes collapsing on them.
Flimsy or poorly-built homes made of dry masonry, stone and timber gave little protection from the quakes, in ground left unstable by days of heavy rain, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

• UN Committee on the Rights of Persons says 21,000 children disabled in the conflict
DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates warned Israel on Wednesday that annexation in the occupied West Bank would be a “red line” that would severely undermine the Abraham Accords that normalised relations between the two countries.
The comments came as US President Donald Trump, who first brokered the accords, seeks to expand them in his current term, though efforts have stalled amid growing international criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war.
The warning followed an announcement in August by Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich that work would start on a long-delayed settlement intended to divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Smotrich has also called for annexing the West Bank.
“From the very beginning, we viewed the Accords as a way to enable our continued support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspiration for an independent state,” United Arab Emira­tes’s Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lana Nusseibeh told Reuters. “We call on the Israeli government to suspend these [settlement] plans.”
 
 

Ms Nusseibeh added that annexation “would constitute a red line for the United Arab Emirates,” as it would undermine the “vision and spirit” of the accords and end the pursuit of regional integration.
The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, on Wednesday, Smotrich said maps were being drawn up for annexing territory, though it was unclear if he had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s support.
Gaza offensive
The diplomatic friction comes as the Israeli military pushed deeper into Gaza City, with soldiers and tanks entering Sheikh Radwan, one of the urban center’s most crowded neighbourhoods.
Residents said the military destroyed homes and tent encampments that housed Palestinians displaced by the war.
According to local health officials, at least 24 Palestinians, including children, were killed across Gaza, most of them in Gaza City, on Wednesday.
“Sheikh Radwan is being burnt upside-down.
The occupation destroyed houses, burnt tents, and drones played audio messages ordering people to leave the area,” said Zakeya Sami, 60.
“If the takeover of Gaza City isn’t stopped, we might die, and we are not going to forgive anyone who stands and watches,” she told Reuters.
Witnesses said the military also dropped grenades on three schools in the Sheikh Radwan area sheltering displaced families and bombed a medical clinic, destroying two ambulances.
Netanyahu has ordered the military to take the city, which he describes as the last stronghold of Hamas.
In Israel, public sentiment has increasingly favoured ending the war in a deal to release the remaining prisoners.
In Jerusalem on Wednesday, protesters climbed the roof of Israel’s national library, displaying a banner that read, “You have abandoned and also killed.”
Children disabled
The war’s devastating toll on civilians was highlighted in a United Nations report Wednesday, which found that at least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the conflict began.
The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that of the 40,500 children who have suffered new war-related injuries, more than half have been left disabled.
The committee reported that Israeli evacuation orders were “often inaccessible” to people with hearing or visual impairments. Committee member Muhannad Al-Azzeh cited the example of a deaf mother in Rafah killed with her children, unaware of evacuation instructions.
Restrictions on humanitarian aid have disproportionately affected people with disabilities, who face severe disruptions to assistance, leaving many without food, water, or sanitation.
The committee noted that 83 per cent of disabled people have lost assistive devices like wheelchairs and walkers, which Israeli authorities often consider “dual-use items” and exclude from aid shipments.
“We can’t expect children with disabilities… to be able to run and go to the (aid) points,” Mr Azzeh said. “This is why one of our main recommendations is that children with disabilities must be reached out to.”

The ‘Rapid Needs Assessment’ report prepared by UN-OCHA says Buner recorded the largest losses of agricultural land with 1,157 acres affected, followed by Swat with 853 acres, Shangla with 559 acres, and Swabi with 330 acres.
Over 80 per cent of people reported crop losses which were significant in Battagram and Mansehra, while Lower Dir and Torghar reported smaller but notable losses, further threatening food security and livelihoods, the UN-OCHA report says.
People lost about 6,206 livestock across the affected areas of 10 districts. Buner reported the highest losses with 4,818 animals, followed by Swat with 618, Shangla with 295, Battagram with 219, and Swabi with 105. Smaller but significant losses were recorded in Bajaur, Mansehra, Torghar, and Upper Dir, while Lower Dir reported minimal impact.

Report says over 80pc of people reported crop losses; 6,206 livestock lost

The loss of livestock further weakened the livelihoods of rural households already facing crop damage and displacement.
Across most flood-affected areas, market access has remained relatively stable. Overall, 77 per cent of markets were reported as accessible, with full access in districts such as Bajaur, Battagram, Lower Dir, Tor Ghar, and Upper Dir.
Swat and Mansehra also reported high levels of access, showing that even in areas severely hit by floods, physical access to markets was somehow maintained. However, Buner had the lowest access at only 35 per cent, leaving people there with limited options for essential supplies.
Despite this physical access, food and non-food availability in markets remains a challenge across many districts.
 
 

The regular supply of essential commodities was disrupted in 55 per cent of the affected areas, with Swabi, Shangla, and Swat facing the most significant interruptions.
This means that while people in several districts can reach markets, goods they need are often either unavailable or supplied inconsistently, affecting food security and basic household needs.
Despite considerable efforts by the KP government and humanitarian actors, the assessment data reveals that many affected people continue to face critical gaps in assistance across multiple sectors.
Food assistance reached the largest proportion of affected households at 42 per cent overall, with significant support reported in Buner, Swabi, and Shangla districts.
However, in Battagram, Lower Dir, Torghar, and Upper Dir districts, people reported no or very limited food assistance. Similarly, health services were the second-most supported sector, reaching 39 pc of the affected population.
Major health interventions were reported in Buner (82pc), Swabi (50pc), and Shangla (22pc), but Torghar and Upper Dir districts reported no health assistance at all. In terms of shelter support, only 20 per cent of households reported receiving assistance.
Districts like Swabi (50pc) and Buner (31pc) reported the highest coverage, whereas most other districts reported minimal or no assistance despite extensive housing damages. Nutrition support was reported by just 15pc of people, largely concentrated in Buner (48pc), with almost no coverage in other districts, leaving children and pregnant women at risk.
The education sector was the least supported, with only 2pc coverage, despite widespread damage to school infrastructure in districts like Buner, Swat, and Shangla, potentially impacting thousands of children.
Overall, the data highlights that while food and health received the most attention, shelter, nutrition, and education remain critically underserved, requiring targeted and sustained interventions to bridge the assistance gaps across all affected districts.

• ‘Hot mic’ catches Xi and Putin discussing biotechnology, prospects of prolonging human life
• PM meets Chinese businessmen, tours Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital
BEIJING: President Xi Jinping warned the world was facing a choice between peace or war, as China showcased its military arsenal at a massive parade on Wednesday.
“Today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” Xi told a crowd of more than 50,000 spectators at Tiananmen Square, adding that the Chinese people “firmly stand on the right side of history”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sha­­r­if was also in attendance, alon­g­side Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and North Kor­e­an Leader Kim Jong Un, Iran­ian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, and a host of other world leaders.
The event to mark 80 years since Japan’s defeat at the end of World War II was designed to project China’s military might and diplomatic clout.
It managed to get a rise out of US President Donald Tru­mp, who wrote an acidic post on his Truth Social Platform.
“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” Trump added.
The Kremlin said Putin was not conspiring against the Uni­ted States and suggested Tru­mp was being ironic in his remarks.
Military hardware and a ‘hot mic’
Riding in an open-top limousine, Xi then inspected the tro­ops and cutting-edge military equipment such as hypersonic missiles, underwater dron­es and a weaponised ‘robot wolf’.
Helicopters trailing large banners and fighter jets flew in formation during a 70-minute showcase that culminated in the release of 80,000 ‘peace’ birds.
New underwater drones and supersonic missiles counted among the gear on display, as well as the ICBMs.
Donning a tunic suit in the style worn by former leader Mao Zedong, Xi earlier greeted more than 25 leaders on the red carpet, including Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto who made a surprise appearance despite widespread protests at home.
Seated between Putin and Kim in the viewing gallery during the parade, Xi repeatedly engaged in conversations with both leaders as thousands of troops and materiel passed before them. It marked the first time the trio have appeared together in public. At a lavish reception after the parade at the Great Hall of the People, Xi told his guests that humanity must not return to the “law of the jungle”.
Earlier, when Russian President Vladimir Putin walked shoulder to shoulder with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a hot mic caught them discussing organ transplants and the possibility that humans could live to 150 years old.
The moment was carried on the livestream provided by state broadcaster CCTV.
 
 

As Putin and Xi walked toward the Tiananmen rostrum where they viewed the parade with Kim, Putin’s translator could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”
The translator added, after an inaudible passage: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and (you can) even achieve immortality.”
In response, Xi, who was off camera, can be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”
Kim was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi, but it was not clear if the conversation was being translated for him.
PM Shehbaz’s schedule
On Wednesday, PM Shehbaz visited Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital, and directed Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to establish simple, robust and sustainable infrastructure at Islamabad’s under-construction hospitals, including Jinnah Medical Complex, to deliver high-quality medical facilities, modelled on Chinese standards.
 
 

He also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing to boost business-to-business (B2B) investment cooperation between the two countries.
The prime minister emphasized that industrial cooperation remains the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a defining pillar of the high-quality development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it enters into its second phase.
He invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into Special Economic Zones.

• PDMA chief fears renewed flooding in central Punjab as Indian dams near max capacity;
says ‘Ravi flowing backwards’ instead of merging with Chenab
• 3.7m affected across province, death toll jumps to 46; another massive surge expected at Multan tomorrow
LAHORE: As the confluence of the swollen Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal threatens the districts of Multan and Muzaffargarh, provincial authorities on Wednesday braced for an unprecedented disaster in light of a “dual threat”, which persisted despite several controlled breaches over the past week.
The water level at Muhammadwala and Sher Shah was recorded at 412 feet, only five feet below critical level. The authorities termed the next 12 hours critical, as the pressure at the breaching points continued to increase after the convergence of the Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal.
In order to save urban centres along the eastern rivers, the Punjab government has been following a policy of controlled breaches to relieve pressure on barrages and main embankments to protect densely populated cities. A decision on whether to conduct a breach at Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah Flood Bund, and Rangpur is expected within hours to save Multan and Muzaffargarh, with 17 points identified.
However, the situation in these two districts is compounded because of an enormous surge of approximately 550,000 cusecs that crossed the Marala and Khanki Headworks and was recorded passing through Qadirabad Headworks with an intensity of 530,000 cusecs. Officials projected that this powerful surge would reach Trimmu Headworks on Thursday and is expected to arrive in the Multan region by Friday.
“The next 12 hours are extremely critical,” stated a Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) official closely involved in crisis management. “We are facing a dual threat: the existing high water from the confluence of the rivers and a new, massive wave heading directly for us. All resources are being mobilised,” he said.
 
 

On the other hand, the railway traffic to Karachi and vice versa was suspended from Faisalabad after a bridge on a railway track on the Chenab River came under water in Abdul Hakim.
Flood warnings
In a press conference on Wednesday ev­­ening, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the flood crisis was set to intensify as all three major Indian dams were expected to reach their maximum capacity within the next 72 hours, exacerbating an already catastrophic situation in the Punjab river system. Addressing a press conference, DG Kathia revealed that his office had received three separate flood warnings in the past 24 hours alone.
He confirmed that while the water level in the Chenab River was currently stable, previously affected districts along its cou­rse were likely to face renewed flooding.
The Sutlej River has been in a flood-like condition for the past two months, while the Ravi River was experiencing rising levels at the Jassar monitoring point. “The next 72 hours are critical,” he stated.
“Thein Dam is already full and will continue to release water into the Ravi for the next two to three weeks. While the situation in Ravi will not be as severe as before, water levels will definitely increase.”
In an alarming development, the DG explained that instead of merging with the Chenab as normally expected, the Ravi’s waters are flowing backwards, preventing any decrease in its water levels. “Until water levels decrease at Ahmadpur Sial, we will not see any reduction at Sidhnai,” he clarified.
 

THIS map shows the locations of controlled breaches, carried out by authorities so far to save major urban centres in Punjab. According to PDMA, arrangements are in place to breach more dykes at Head Muhammadwala, Shershah and Rangpur.

The presser came after Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz conducted a personal assessment of the critical Head Muhammadwala site. DG Kathia said they were facing a major challenge here because it had only four to five feet of capacity remaining before reaching critical levels.
“At Sher Shah Bridge in Multan, there’s significant water pressure with only a two-foot margin remaining,” he revealed. “Im­­portant decisions regarding a controlled breaching in Multan have already been made to prevent uncontrolled overflow.”
Speaking about the damage, the DG said that more than 3,900 villages and a population exceeding 3.7 million had been affected across Punjab. The death toll has risen to 46 people, while over 1.4m residents and 1m animals had been relocated to safer locations.
 
 

The relief effort has expanded to include 409 flood camps where all essential facilities are being provided to approximately 25,000 displaced persons currently taking shelter.
In the Khanewal and Toba Tek Singh districts, the flooding has already affec­ted 136 and 75 villages, respectively, with numbers expected to rise in light of renewed surges.
Punjab CM’s visit
Earlier, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited flood relief camps in Multan and directed the district administrations to ascertain the scale of damage caused by the floods.
She directed the deputy commissioners to conduct surveys in the flood-affected areas and also provide clean drinking water. She also ordered fumigation and dry germicidal sprays in the flood relief camps and tent cities in the flood-affected areas.

Trump has been frustrated at his inability to put a halt to the fighting, which began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after he initially predicted he would be able to end the war swiftly when he took office in January.
Trump said he would be holding talks in the next few days. A White House official said Trump is expected to speak on the phone on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The French presidency said earlier today that several European leaders, including Zelensky and France’s Emmanuel Macron, would call Trump on Thursday afternoon.
That call was expected to follow a mostly virtual meeting on Thursday, hosted by France, of some 30 countries to discuss their latest efforts to provide Ukraine with security support once there is a peace agreement with Russia. The European leaders were also expected to denounce Moscow’s unwillingness to negotiate.
Putin has shown little interest in ending the war after he and Trump voiced optimism about making progress during their meeting in Anchorage on August 16.
“I have no message to President Putin,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he met Polish President Karol Nawrocki.
“He knows where I stand, and he’ll make a decision one way or another. Whatever his decision is, we’ll either be happy about it or unhappy about it, and if we’re unhappy about it, you’ll see things happen,” he said.
Trump did not explain what he meant, but he has talked about the possibility of imposing more sanctions on Russia.
Putin tells Ukraine to end war via talks or he will end it by force
Russian President Vladimir Putin told Kyiv that there was a chance to end the war in Ukraine via negotiations “if common sense prevails”, an option he’d prefer, but that he was ready to end it by force if that was the only way.
Speaking in China at the end of a visit there, Putin said that he perceived “a certain light at the end of the tunnel”, given what he said were sincere efforts by the US to find a settlement to Europe’s ‘biggest land war’ since World War Two.
“It seems to me that if common sense prevails, it will be possible to agree on an acceptable solution to end this conflict. That is my assumption,” he told reporters in Beijing.
“Especially since we can see the mood of the current US administration under President Trump, and we see not just their statements, but their sincere desire to find this solution.
“And I think there is a certain light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s see how the situation develops. If not, then we will have to resolve all the tasks before us by force of arms.”
Putin did not, however, indicate any willingness to soften his long-standing demands that Ukraine abandon any ideas of joining Nato, reverse what Moscow has described as discrimination against Russian speakers and ethnic Russians, or step back from the idea that Moscow must have full control of at least the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine.
He said he was ready to hold talks with Zelensky if the Ukrainian president came to Moscow, but that it remained to be seen whether such a meeting was worthwhile.
He repeated his view that Zelensky, who has not faced re-election due to martial law despite his official term in office expiring, was illegitimate. Kyiv flatly rejects that, saying it is impossible to hold meaningful elections at a time of war.
Zelensky has been pressing to meet Putin to discuss the terms of a possible deal, even though the two sides remain far apart, urging Washington to sanction Moscow again if Putin does not agree.
Trump has also said he wants the two leaders to meet and spoken of but not yet imposed secondary sanctions on Russia.
Putin told reporters he had always been open to meeting Zelensky, but reiterated the Kremlin’s oft-repeated stance that such a meeting had to be well prepared in advance and lead to tangible results.
“As for a meeting with Zelensky, I have never ruled out the possibility of such a meeting. But is there any point? Let’s see,” said Putin.</p><small>2025-09-03 18:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0321500168f9e0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939456/death-toll-in-suicide-bombing-at-bnps-quetta-rally-rises-to-15' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in suicide bombing at BNP’s Quetta rally rises to 15</strong></a><br><p>The death toll in a suicide bombing near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab the previous night rose to 15 on Wednesday.
The attack occurred shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal. The banned militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility today for the attack, AFP reported.
Addressing a press conference today, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said that the suicide attack claimed 15 lives and injured 32 others.
He said the explosion occurred approximately 500 metres from the exit point of the rally, adding that the rally had officially concluded hours earlier, with the blast taking place at 9:45pm in a poorly lit area near a graveyard.
Shafqaat said that the attacker was unable to breach the main gathering due to stringent security measures, including the deployment of 120 police personnel.
He added that this forced the assailant to detonate the device away from the crowd. “The remains of the bomber, believed to be under 30 years old, were recovered, and authorities estimate that around eight kilogrammes of explosives were used,” he said.
Shaqaat said that the chief minister had announced a compensation package of Rs1.5 million for families of the deceased, Rs0.5m for each injured individual and Rs 200,000 in support for minor victims.
He said Section 144 has been enforced across Balochistan till September 15 and a province-wide high alert remains in effect, adding that authorities have also prohibited public gatherings and processions after sundown, especially during Eid Miladun Nabi, to ensure public safety.
Shafqaat urged the public to trust law enforcement agencies, follow security protocols and report any suspicious activity.
CM Bugti orders swift action against perpetrators, calls for unity
Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, declaring that terrorists would not be allowed to destabilise the province’s peace.
The chief minister expressed these remarks during a high-level meeting on law and order convened in the wake of the attack.
 






During the meeting, Shafqaat and Acting Inspector General of Police Saeed Wazir presented a detailed briefing on the incident. CM Bugti emphasised the need to strengthen security protocols and assured that there would be zero tolerance for lapses in public protection.
He directed Shafqaat to keep both the public and media informed with verified updates to counter misinformation.
“The terrorists behind the Shahwani Stadium blast will be brought to their logical conclusion and held accountable under the law,” Bugti added, reaffirming the government’s solidarity with the victims’ families.
He said that critically injured individuals would be transferred to Karachi via government air services if necessary to ensure optimal medical care.
The chief minister urged political parties and citizens to cooperate with law enforcement agencies during the current threat alert.
“This is a time for unity and collective resolve to defeat those who seek to spread fear,” he said.
In preparation for upcoming religious events, Bugti instructed officials to devise a comprehensive security plan for Eid Miladun Nabi processions. He appealed to the public to support authorities in maintaining peace during these gatherings.
He also visited Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre and Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta to enquire about the health of blast victims.
Health department officials briefed the chief minister on the medical facilities provided to the injured.
The chief minister met the injured and their heirs and asked about the quality of treatment.
Expressing his satisfaction over the steps taken for the treatment and care of the injured, he said that all possible medical facilities were being provided to the injured.
CM Bugti said that terrorists were showing cowardice by targeting innocent citizens and they would not succeed in their design to sabotage the peace of the province.
 






President, PM Shehbaz condemn blast
President Asif Ali Zardari vehemently condemned the blast, said a statement from the Presidency, adding he directed the relevant institutions to launch a comprehensive investigation into the incident and ensure that the perpetrators were brought to justice.
The president expressed his profound grief and solidarity with the families of those who lost their lives in the attack, offering his condolences. He also prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and issued directives to concerned officials to provide them with the best possible medical treatment.
In a separate statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is currently on an official visit to Beijing, also condemned the attack in the strongest terms. The premier expressed his deep sorrow and anguish over the loss of lives.
PM Shehbaz characterised the assault on the political rally as “damning evidence of the nefarious conspiracy by terrorists to spread chaos in Balochistan”. He asserted that “terrorists are the enemies of peace and development in Balochistan.”
He further declared, “We will continue the war against terrorism until the complete eradication of this menace.”
PM Shehbaz stated that attacks on innocent and unarmed citizens were “cowardly and condemnable”. The prime minister also instructed authorities to provide the best medical facilities to the wounded and to ensure the swift identification and prosecution of those involved in the bombing.
He also spoke with CM Bugti to extend his condolences.
 






“The terrorists involved in the blast will be traced and given exemplary punishment,” the prime minister said. “Terrorists are enemies of peace and development in Balochistan.“</p><small>2025-09-03 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03200454272e9e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939447/karachi-school-management-booked-for-manslaughter-as-employee-dies-by-suicide' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi school management booked for manslaughter as employee ‘dies by suicide’</strong></a><br><p>The management of a private school in Karachi has been booked over charges of manslaughter after a young employee purportedly died by suicide, it emerged on Wednesday.
The 25-year-old employee allegedly jumped from the eighth floor of the school building on September 1, according to a first information report (FIR) registered at Brigade police station.
According to the complainant, who was the victim’s brother, “On September 1, he (the victim) left home at around 8:15am for work. At around 9:35am, I received a phone call informing me that my brother’s health had deteriorated and he was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).”
The complainant said that when he arrived at JPMC, the school’s administration staff was also present and they informed him that his brother fell from the eighth floor of the building at around 8:45am.
He added that when he reached the emergency room, he saw that his brother was dead.
“It later transpired that my brother had left a message on social media, naming three men who ‘mentally tortured’ him,” the complainant stated.
He alleged that his brother ended his life because of mental pressure and wanted to pursue legal action against the three people named in the social media post.
The police invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 322 (punishment for manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the suspects.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the victim’s cause of death was “injury to thoraco-abdominal contents”.
She added that multiple bones found fractured in the body. “Thoraco-abdominal cavities found full of blood and there were lacerated wounds on the back,” she continued.
“Visceral samples have been collected to rule out intoxication.”</p><small>2025-09-03 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621801-pakistan-dispatches-humanitarian-assistance-to-quake-hit-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dispatches 105 tonnes of humanitarian aid to quake-hit Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>

GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects. While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.
The bidding ceremony was held today at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, where a large number of outfitters and hunters participated in an auction.
Shikar Safari’s owner, Raja Farhad Maqpoon, placed the highest bid of $370,000 and won the Astore markhor hunting permit at the Nanga Parbat conservancy area in Astore, while the second bidder won the Astore markhor hunting permit for $286,000, the third for $270,000 and the fourth permit for $240,000, respectively.
The highest bid of $40,000 was placed by Muhammad Ali Nagri from Markhor Safaris for a Blue sheep permit, and the same bidder also placed $13,000 for a Himalayan ibex and won both.
GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife, Khadim Abbas, told Dawn.com that for the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit was raised to $200,000, while blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
 
 

Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep and $5,500 for ibex. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa wildlife department had auctioned the highest rate Markhor hunting permit in Chitral for $271,000.
In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Separately, local outfitters and tour operators argued that the sharp fee hikes were damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients.
They warned of losses for both outfitters and the local communities that relied on trophy hunting revenue.
Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme had dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
“Trophy hunting can either remain a success story in GB or fade into history as a failed experiment. The choice lies in the wisdom and vision of the communities that are its true custodians,” he said.
He added that such decisions changed the objectives of the programme as the trophy hunting programme was not supposed to be a commercial endeavour.
Similarly, Syed Sumsam Ali Bokhari, chairman of Safari Club International Pakistan Chapter, warned that rising prices undermined Pakistan’s competitiveness compared to neighbouring countries.</p><small>2025-09-03 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/032048061c23d18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939445/pakistan-dispatches-105-tonnes-of-humanitarian-aid-for-quake-struck-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dispatches 105 tonnes of humanitarian aid for quake struck Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday dispatched 105 tonnes of humanitarian aid for quake-struck Afghanistan, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The earthquake killed a total of 1,469 people and injured more than 3,700, according to a new toll from Taliban authorities, making it one of the deadliest in decades to hit the impoverished country, according to AFP.
The vast majority of the casualties — more than 1,450 — were in Kunar province, with a dozen dead and hundreds hurt in nearby Nangarhar and Laghman provinces.
“Following my telephone call with Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi, the government of Pakistan today dispatched 105 tonnes of humanitarian relief assistance to Afghanistan,” a statement from FM Dar said.
 






The consignment includes “essential food items, medicines, tents, blankets, and bubble mats”, aimed at supporting those affected by the recent earthquakes in the country, the statement added.
“We extend our deepest condolences and prayers for the victims and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,” FM Dar said.
Pakistan stands in solidarity with the brotherly people of Afghanistan in this difficult time, he added.
The relief supplies are being sent to Afghanistan via the Torkham border via five trucks with 40-foot containers. The departure ceremony of the supplies was held at the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warehouse in Islamabad, PTV News reported.
The ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Kohistani, along with officials from the NDMA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This was the third major earthquake since the Taliban took power in 2021, but there are even fewer resources for the cash-strapped government’s response after the United States slashed assistance to the country when President Donald Trump took office in January.
Even before the earthquake, the United Nations estimated it had obtained less than a third of the funding required for operations countrywide.
Days after quake, Afghan survivors still await aid
Rescue teams struggled to reach survivors as night approached days after the powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, as access to remote areas remained obstructed.
Fearful of the near-constant aftershocks rattling the area, people huddled in the open air while others struggled to unearth those trapped under the heaps of flattened buildings.
Access remained difficult, as aftershocks caused rockfall, stymying access to already isolated villages and keeping families huddled outdoors for fear of the remains of damaged homes collapsing on them.
“Everyone is afraid and there are many aftershocks,” Awrangzeeb Noori, 35, told AFP from the village of Dara-i-Nur in Nangarhar province. “We spend all day and night in the field without shelter.”
 


The non-governmental group Save the Children said one of its aid teams “had to walk for 20 kilometres to reach villages cut off by rock falls, carrying medical equipment on their backs with the help of community members”.
The World Food Programme (WFP) shared images of teams hiking up slopes carrying boxes of food aid on their shoulders.
The Taliban government deputy spokesperson, Hamdullah Fitrat, told AFP that areas that had taken days to reach had been finally accessed.
“We cannot determine the date for finishing the operation in all areas as the area is very mountainous and it is very difficult to reach every area.”
More than 12,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, according to ActionAid, noting women and girls were particularly vulnerable in emergencies as they face steep restrictions under the Taliban authorities.
Residents of Jalalabad, the nearest city to the quake epicentre, donated money and goods such as blankets to be delivered to those impacted by the quake.
“I am a simple labourer and I came here to help the earthquake victims because I felt very sad for them,” said resident Mohammad Rahman.
“If I could do more, I would help even more, but I helped with what I had.”
Afghanistan airdrops commandos to rescue quake survivors
Afghanistan also airdropped commandos to pull survivors from the rubble in areas ravaged by earthquakes, as a UN agency warned that food aid for victims would run out soon without urgent funding.
Dozens of commando forces were being airdropped at sites where helicopters cannot land, to help carry the injured to safer ground, in what aid groups said was a race against time to rescue those still stuck under rubble.
Time was also running out for those who survived the two devastating quakes in the remote eastern region of the impoverished country, the WFP warned today.
John Aylieff, the head of WFP in Afghanistan, told Reuters that the agency only has enough funding and stocks for the next four weeks.
“Four weeks is just not enough even to meet the basic, essential needs of the population struck by the earthquake, let alone put the victims on a path back to rebuilding their lives,” Aylieff said.
WFP funding for Afghanistan this year is just under $300 million, according to UN financial data, down from $1.7 billion in 2022, the first full year the country was ruled by the Taliban.
Resources for rescue and relief work are tight in the nation of 42 million people hit by war, poverty and shrinking aid. It has received limited global help after the disaster.</p><small>2025-09-03 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03125922db98c59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939386/business-tycoon-renowned-philanthropist-rafiq-m-habib-passes-away-at-88' target='_blank'><strong>Business tycoon, renowned philanthropist Rafiq M.

Rafiq was the former head of the House of Habib conglomerate, Habib University’s chancellor, and a member of Stile company’s board of directors. He was also the chairman of the Habib University Foundation.
“With profound sorrow, Habib University mourns the passing of its founding chancellor, Rafiq M. Habib (1937-2025), and honours his enduring legacy,” Habib University said in a post on Instagram.

Remembering him, the varsity said: “A man whose calm resolve and deep integrity shaped every step of this journey, Rafiq sahab was the moral and visionary force behind the creation of Habib University.
“His belief that education must serve the greater good continues to guide our mission. His legacy lives on in the institution he helped build and the generations it will continue to empower.”
According to Habib University’s website, Rafiq was a trustee of “several welfare projects”, including education, healthcare, relief and rehabilitation.
Rafiq actively participated in social welfare programmes and had been part of “several welfare institutions covering a wide range of social activities, education being the prime focus, where the family runs its own schools and supports other schools presently imparting high quality primary education to over 8,000 children”, Stiles noted.
Rafiq had a “wide business experience” in the insurance and banking industry, and promoted many companies, including Indus Motor Company Limited.
“He is a Rotarian, an effective major donor, supports Polio Plus programme and actively promotes street schools, home schools, etc,” Stiles added.
The businessman remained as a consultant for Habib Bank AG Zurich, which has Habib Metropolitan Bank as its subsidiary in Pakistan.
He also served for several years on the Board of Directors of Philips Electrical Company of Pakistan Ltd and was the first chairman on Standard Chartered Bank’s advisory board in the country.
Wasif Rizvi, the president of Habib University, termed Rafiq a “towering figure of vision, humility, and steadfast service, whose leadership and generosity laid the very foundations” of the varsity.
“Rafiq sahib was the visionary in the legendary Habib family to imagine a world-class institution of higher learning being founded in Karachi,” Rizvi wrote in a statement.
“His generosity was never about recognition, it was an act of devotion to knowledge, to service, and to the belief that education is the noblest inheritance one can give to society.”</p><small>2025-09-03 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0318312501aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939439/lahore-atc-grants-bail-to-imran-khans-nephew-shahrez-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC grants bail to Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez in May 9 riots case</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Wednesday granted bail to PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023, riots.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict that was reserved earlier today on Shahrez’s bail petition and ordered his release subject to paying a surety bond set at Rs100,000. Shahrez’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar, confirmed the development to Dawn.com and PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said the same.
 






Lahore Police had picked up Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Shahrez was sent on 14-day judicial remand by the Lahore ATC on August 30.
During today’s hearing on Shahrez’s bail petition, Advocate Mudassar argued that the athlete was accused of inciting party workers, adding that the investigation was approached from multiple angles, with geo-fencing carried out as well, and yet no evidence was found against Imran’s nephew.
“Everything is clear in the challan, it mentions named and unnamed suspects but Shahrez is not mentioned at all, no investigator gave any statement. He was arrested after 28 months and his mother — the PTI founder’s sister —  is raising her voice for his release. This arrest was made to suppress their voice,” he said.
The lawyer argued that Shahrez was in Chitral during the riots and several people had submitted affidavits in this regard. He said the athlete was also due to go abroad to compete in a sporting event.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI had challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-09-03 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621779-rabi-ul-awal-sindh-govt-announces-two-day-holiday-on-eid-milad-un-nabi' target='_blank'><strong>Rabi ul Awal: Sindh govt announces two-day holiday on Eid Milad un Nabi</strong></a><br><p>

For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur on a daily basis.
In a post on X, the Punjab Police said that “an operation against dacoit hideouts was carried out in Rahim Yar Khan’s Kacha Ronti, using drones”.
“The operation left multiple dacoits injured,” the statement added.
Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar commended the efforts of the police and was quoted as saying, “Punjab Police is fully utilising drone technology not only to assist flood-affected people but also to eliminate criminal elements.”
 






On August 1, five cops were martyred after bandits of the Katcha area attacked a police checkpoint in Rahim Yar Khan.
In March, three people were allegedly shot dead by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River, to avenge the murder of a YouTuber.</p><small>2025-09-03 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031535305d1b149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939410/rawalpindi-police-arrest-principal-over-alleged-rape-abortion-of-student' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi Police arrest principal over alleged rape, abortion of student</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Police on Wednesday said they had arrested the principal of a private academy over the alleged rape and forced abortion of a Grade 10 student.
The student, a resident of Khayaban-i-Sir Syed of Rawalpindi’s Pirwadhai town, had lodged a first information report (FIR) with the police on Monday under Sections 338A (punishment  for  Isqat-i-haml) and 376i (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alleging that her academy’s principal raped her multiple times and forced her to have an abortion.
In her complaint, the victim alleged that the principal, who was childless, had offered to marry her while she was studying in Grade 10. She reportedly told him to approach her parents regarding the matter.
She further said that the principal started coming closer to her and assured her that he would help her get good marks in the matriculation examination, convincing her to have physical relations with him.
The complainant claimed that the man called her into his office and raped her. After a few months, she informed him that she was pregnant, but instead of marrying her, he gave her medicine for an abortion.
As per the FIR, the victim alleged that the suspect continued raping her from time to time and again made her pregnant. However, when she insisted on marriage, he refused and began subjecting her to torture.
A statement by the police on X quoted Rawalpindi Superintendent of Police Rawal Arshad as saying that the force took swift action and arrested the suspect, adding that the victim’s medical examination had also been initiated.
SP Arshad said a challan would be filed in court with solid evidence to ensure an exemplary punishment for the suspect.  and real punishment will be ensured. “Violence, abuse or harassment against women and children is unacceptable,” he said.
 






Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier ordered an “immediate and transparent” investigation into the incident, according to a statement issued today by Tarar’s office.
The minister ordered the suspect’s immediate arrest and sought a report on the incident. “The provision of justice to the affected student should be ensured under all circumstances,” Tarar, who is also the law minister, was quoted as saying.
According to Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, the punishment for rape can be a death sentence or imprisonment of not less than 10 years and not more than 25 years, or the remainder of the convict’s life, along with a fine.
 
 

In May, a sessions court in Rawalpindi sentenced a man to death for raping a woman under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Act, 2021.
Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.
However, systemic challenges persist, with the national level conviction rate for rape at a mere 0.5 per cent, according to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO).
National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said last month that only 41pc of the women raped report it, and even out of those, many back off due to societal pressure.
 
 

Last month, the interior ministry reported that 200 of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025 involved children.
In June, Rawalpindi police said they had arrested an Adiala jail employee who allegedly raped his 11-year-old niece in the prison’s residential colony.
The same month, a woman in the district’s Dhamial area complained to the police that she had allegedly been sexually assaulted by her landlord’s son.</p><small>2025-09-03 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031752099127f06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939434/boxer-imane-khelif-not-competing-at-world-championships-amid-sex-testing-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Boxer Imane Khelif not competing at world championships amid sex testing appeal</strong></a><br><p>Imane Khelif has the right to appeal World Boxing’s decision barring her from events unless she undergoes genetic sex testing but the Algerian is not competing at the world championships as she has not entered, World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst said.
World Boxing, which will oversee boxing in the 2028 Olympics, introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions in May, less than a year after Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting won gold in Paris amid a gender-eligibility row.
But Khelif appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport — sport’s highest court — seeking to overturn World Boxing’s ruling asking boxers to undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test.
“She has the right to do this (appeal). For us, it’s important to stress that we introduced mandatory testing in order to have safe and competitive competitions, fair competitions,” Van der Vorst said on Wednesday.
“We announced it in May. And for us, everyone is equal. Every woman here has to submit several documents, including the sex testing.”
The World Boxing Championships get underway in Liverpool on Thursday and when asked if Khelif would have failed the test, Van der Vorst said: “It’s too early to draw conclusions.
“She has simply not entered on behalf of her own federation here in Liverpool.”
The Algerian Boxing Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, World Boxing confirmed Taiwan’s Lin would not be competing at the world championships either.
“I know that she also is not part of the entry list of the National Federation,” Van der Vorst added.
The Dutchman had apologised in June when World Boxing specifically named Khelif in their announcement on mandatory sex testing.
However, he defended the decision for such tests to ensure they had “safe and fair competitions”.
“We are speaking not only about amateur boxing, but Olympic boxing. For us, that’s our brand, because that’s the ‘why’ of World Boxing. We established World Boxing in order to save the Olympic dream,” he said.
“Boxing is a combat sport and it is important to have safe and fair competitions. So, for us, it’s really crucial to introduce this kind of testing. I think it’s an important step that we show that we want to protect female boxing.”</p><small>2025-09-03 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621745-private-academys-principal-arrested-for-allegedly-raping-student-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Private academy's principal arrested for allegedly raping student in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

The monsoon season in India has been particularly intense this year, killing at least 130 people in August alone in north India, wiping out villages and destroying infrastructure.
The latest round of flooding has hit northern areas of occupied Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab, where the Chenab and Tawi rivers have risen above the danger mark at several spots.
The swollen rivers have triggered landslides and damaged many roads, disconnecting parts of the mountainous regions of Jammu and Himachal from the rest of India.
At least five people were killed today after landslides battered Rajouri and Mandi districts in Jammu and Himachal Pradesh, respectively, officials said.
The India Meteorological Department warned of heavy to very heavy rain in the region today, with more downpours expected in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
The Central Water Commission said the swollen Yamuna had breached its danger mark a day ago in Delhi.
Local media reported that nearly 10,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps set up by the government along the main highways as a precautionary measure for those living in low-lying areas.
Residents living along the Yamuna in Delhi were evacuated in 2023 as well after floodwaters entered their homes and the river hit its highest level in 45 years.
 
 

Many tourist spots in Himachal Pradesh have been hit by landslides in recent weeks, as raging rivers damaged infrastructure.
Educational institutions were ordered shut, authorities said, asking people to remain indoors due to flood warnings.
In neighbouring India’s Punjab, the government said 30 people have been killed and nearly 20,000 evacuated since August 1.
Water gushing through the plains in India’s breadbasket Punjab state has destroyed 150,000 hectares of crops, the government said a day ago.
Continuous rain prompted authorities to release water from dams, which has caused flooding in the plains in India and Pakistan in recent days.
On the other side of the border, Pakistani authorities issued an alert for more floods in Punjab today after India warned it would release water downstream from its dams, officials said.
New Delhi has previously given four such warnings to Islamabad, the officials said.
The worst floods in four decades have killed at least 43 people in Pakistan’s Punjab, with more than 3.3 million affected since August 26, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said.
The death toll across Pakistan since the start of the monsoon season in late June stands at 881, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.</p><small>2025-09-03 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031453477be1c82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939405/china-unstoppable-says-xi-with-shehbaz-kim-and-putin-at-his-side' target='_blank'><strong>China ‘unstoppable’, says Xi with Shehbaz, Kim and Putin at his side</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif flanked Chinese President Xi Jinping at a massive parade of military might in Beijing on Wednesday, capping a week of diplomatic grandstanding by the Chinese president and his allies against the West.
The event, ostensibly to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, was a chance for Xi to put on an extravaganza to showcase China’s military prowess and bring together friendly leaders to send a message to the rest of the world.

Kicking off the parade, President Xi warned the world was still “faced with a choice of peace or war”, but said China was “unstoppable”.
China’s enormous new intercontinental ballistic missile DF-5C, with a range of 20,000 kilometres, counted prominently among the tonnes of hardware on display.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “not invited to the parade” and that PM Shehbaz’s presence alongside Xi, Putin, and Kim highlighted Pakistan’s growing significance in the region.
 






The heavily choreographed event drew an acidic response from United States President Donald Trump, who accused the three leaders of plotting against the US.
“Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” he wrote on Truth Social.
 


Military hardware on show
During the 90-minute parade, Xi inspected the massed troops and weaponry from an open-topped limousine down Beijing’s vast Chang’an Avenue, before turning back to join his guests in a seating area above the iconic portrait of Mao Zedong on Tiananmen, the entrance gate of the historic Forbidden City.
China’s huge collection of military vehicles and heavy weapons rolled past the dignitaries, while images of thousands of servicemen and women in immaculate uniforms marching in tight ranks and soldiers jumping in and out of vehicles were shown in a slick state media broadcast.

Besides the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), new underwater drones and supersonic missiles were among the latest gear on display.
Beijing residents went out into the streets to catch a glimpse of a spectacular flypast involving scores of warplanes and helicopters, some making an “80” formation.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941.
 


Whirlwind week
All eyes were on how the trio of Xi, Putin and Kim — who rarely leaves secretive North Korea — interacted with each other, but the state media broadcast only offered rare snatches of the three together and foreign journalists were kept at a distance and told not to film or photograph the leaders.
The event was the climax of a whirlwind week for Xi, who hosted a slew of Eurasian leaders for a summit aimed at putting China front and centre of regional relations.
The club of 10 countries, named the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), touts itself as a non-Western style of collaboration in the region and seeks to be an alternative to traditional alliances.
During the summit, Xi slammed “bullying behaviour” from certain countries — a veiled reference to the United States — while Putin defended Russia’s Ukraine offensive, blaming the West for triggering the conflict.
Many of the guests from the Tianjin gathering, including Putin, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and several other leaders, joined Xi for the Beijing parade. However, no major Western dignitaries were among the two dozen world leaders at the event.
 


Political influence
Security around Beijing was tightened, with road closures, military personnel stationed on bridges and street corners, and miles upon miles of white barriers lining the capital’s wide boulevards.
China has touted the parade as a show of unity, and Kim’s attendance is the first time he has been seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. It is only his second reported trip abroad in six years.
Kim was accompanied on the trip by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who was pictured arriving at Beijing Railway Station, and his sister Kim Yo Jong, who was photographed by AFP at a gala lunch.
Putin and Kim held talks after today’s parade, during which the Russian president thanked Kim for deployments of North Korean soldiers to aid Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.
 


Lam Peng Er, principal research fellow from the East Asian Institute at the
National University of Singapore, said Kim’s visit “demonstrates to the North Koreans and the world that he has powerful Russian and Chinese friends who treat him with respect”.
“China also shows that it has convening power and political influence to bring Putin and Kim Jong Un together,” he told AFP.</p><small>2025-09-03 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621721-six-killed-in-attack-on-passenger-vehicle-in-lower-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>Six killed in attack on passenger vehicle in Lower Kurram</strong></a><br><p>

Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed Marwat said in a statement, “Six passengers have been killed in a tragic incident of firing on a passenger vehicle in Lower Kurram.
“A search operation has been launched after the terrorist incident,” he said, adding that 12 suspects were detained in the operation and a large number of weapons were recovered from them.
“Terrorists will not be spared under any circumstances. No one will be allowed to disturb regional peace,” RPO Marwat stated.
Earlier today, Kurram District Police Officer Kurram Malik Habib Khan said that the unknown assailants fled the scene after the attack. “The bodies have been taken to the hospital,” he said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.
Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Hameed Hussain condemned the incident in a statement, calling it “an attempt to disrupt the peace of the area”.
“Such incidents are regrettable even after the establishment of check posts on the main highway,” he said.
Meanwhile, Haji Zamin Hussain, secretary of the Anjuman-e-Hussainia Parachinar, strongly condemned the attack, stating, “We are shocked at the incident as people of Kurram have been martyred.”
He expressed solidarity with the victims and called for “severe punishment” against the culprits. “We all should stand together to punish the perpetrators,” he said. He added that there has been “complete peace” in the Turi area and no incidents on the road over the past six months.
Kurram has been marred with tribal violence stemming from decades-old land disputes, which claimed at least 130 lives last year. Following months of conflict, the warring tribes reached a ceasefire agreement in January this year, followed by a year-long peace deal signed in July by the Lower Kurram and Sadda tribes.
In April, three people were killed and several others went missing when unidentified assailants attacked a group of people travelling from Parachinar to Peshawar in the Bagan area of Lower Kurram, triggering protests across the tribal district.
