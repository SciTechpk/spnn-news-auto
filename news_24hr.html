The M-Tag is a prepaid radio frequency identification (RFID) sticker for a car windshield that automates toll payments. As a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, scanners identify the vehicle and entry point; upon exiting, the system automatically deducts the fare from the balance, eliminating the need to wait in long queues.
To ensure the security of the federal capital and link vehicles with electronic monitoring, the administration has decided that vehicles without M-Tags will not be allowed to enter Islamabad from the now-extended deadline of January 15.
With 12 days remaining before enforcement begins, authorities in Islamabad have reported steady progress in the M-Tag registration drive. Officials said 120,447 vehicles have been fitted with M-Tags so far, while 3,392 vehicles were registered in the last 24 hours alone.
Excise and Taxation Department Director General (DG) Irfan Memon said arrangements at all M-Tag centres have been strengthened to handle the rising number of visitors as the deadline approaches.

 

Additional staff have been deployed and sufficient stock of tags has been ensured to avoid shortages, he said, adding that the steps were meant to reduce waiting time and allow citizens to complete the process in one visit.
DG Memon said the extension provides sufficient time for vehicle owners to comply and warned that after January 15, action would be taken against vehicles without M-Tags at 12 entry points across the city.
These checks will be carried out with the support of Safe City systems, which have already completed the installation of M-Tag readers at designated locations, he added.
Officials said the electronic readers were now active and integrated with monitoring systems. The setup is intended to identify vehicles entering the city without valid tags. Authorities said this will help enforce compliance and improve traffic oversight.
Officials noted that the daily figures at registration centres have increased as awareness grows and the deadline draws closer. The department expects further rise in registrations over the coming days.
The M-Tag initiative is part of broader efforts to streamline vehicle records and support digital enforcement. By linking vehicle data with electronic systems, authorities aim to improve identification at checkpoints and entry routes. Officials said the system will also assist in managing traffic flow and tracking violations.
Citizens have been advised to bring the required documents when visiting M-Tag centres to ensure quick processing.
According to official guidelines, the vehicle owners must present only two documents at designated M-Tag registration points. These documents are the vehicle registration card or registration book, and the computerised national identity card (CNIC) of the vehicle owner. Copies may be required for record purposes, but original documents must be shown at the counter.
Officials said incomplete documentation remains a common cause of delays and urged applicants to prepare in advance.
The excise department reiterated that the deadline extension was final and encouraged vehicle owners to utilise the remaining 12 days. “The purpose is facilitation, not inconvenience,” DG Memon said, adding that compliance before January 15 will help citizens avoid checks and penalties once enforcement begins.
The authorities also appealed to residents not to wait for the final days, as last-minute rush could increase queues at the registration centres. They said spreading visits over the remaining period would help maintain smooth service.
The department reiterated its commitment to facilitating citizens while preparing for enforcement measures set to begin after January 15.</p><small>2026-01-04 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643196-stolen-over-two-years-ago-karachi-mans-motorcycle-resurfaces-via-e-challan' target='_blank'><strong>Stolen over two years ago, Karachi man's motorcycle resurfaces via e-challan</strong></a><br><p>

A Rescue 1122 spokesperson said the Central Command and Control received the alert and immediately dispatched a water rescue team and trained divers to the site.
“The rescue team carried out a rapid operation and rescued all five affected individuals, who were heading to attend a wedding ceremony,” he said.
The spokesperson said all affected individuals were rescued and taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre by ambulance for medical treatment.
However, one of the women rescued from the drain was reported to be in critical condition, the spokesperson added.
The spokesperson told Dawn that four people – two women and children – were on their way to attend the wedding ceremony. Upon reaching the corner of the street to board the bus, they ascended over a rain drain near the mosque covered with slabs; however, it could not bear their weight, and all four persons fell into it.
A male family member, who rushed to the spot and jumped into the drain to rescue the women and children, was also swept away.
The spokesperson said that the drain was around 50-100 feet deep.
Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad also took notice of the incident and confirmed the rescue of all five family members. He further said that all affected individuals were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
The statement from his office said that an immediate rescue operation was launched at the site on the directives of the deputy mayor.
“The affected individuals were safely pulled out of the drain,” it said.
He said Rescue 1122 teams were promptly dispatched to the location and carried out the operation efficiently.
Murad added that the protection of human lives was the top priority of the city administration and appreciated the timely coordination and cooperation of emergency response agencies during the incident.
Open drains in Pakistan persist due to poor urban planning, lack of maintenance, and weak enforcement of safety standards. During rains, they become invisible hazards, leading to fatal falls, drownings, and injuries, particularly among children.
A week ago, an eight-year-old boy who was playing outside his home drowned in an uncovered manhole in Mehran Town.
Earlier in December, a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, also fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal. His body was recovered more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
According to the Edhi Foundation, 27 people had lost their lives after falling into open manholes and ditches in the metropolis last year.</p><small>2026-01-04 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/041250148554a57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965057/3-on-duty-traffic-policemen-martyred-in-firing-by-suspected-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>3 on-duty traffic policemen martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT/ BANNU: Three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in the Serai Naurang area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Sunday.
Qudratullah, spokesperson for the district police officer (DPO), told Dawn the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when “unidentified terrorists, who were on a motorcycle”, opened fire on them.
As a result, they died on the spot, the spokesperson said.
Ticketing officer in-charge Jalal Khan was among the martyred, he said, adding that two other personnel were identified as Azizullah and Abdullah.
The bodies were moved to Naurang Hospital, and police have launched a search operation at the site of the incident, Qudratullah said.
Later in the day, the funeral prayers of the martyred traffic cops were offered at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines with official honours. Police and district administration officers, the bereaved family members and other residents attended the prayers.

A statement issued by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s office said he condemned the attack and termed the incident “unfortunate”.
“Sacrifices of the martyred policemen will not go in vain. Enemies of the countries cannot succeed in their nefarious designs by such cowardly acts,” the statement quoted him as saying.
He added that policemen were on the front line in the fight against terrorism and had been rendering sacrifices.
The CM said that attackers would be brought to justice and the provincial government was standing with the police.
He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the departed souls.







Separately, a police constable was martyred in firing by unidentified attackers in the Kashfi Khel area of KP’s Bannu district, spokesperson for the Bannu DPO Asif Hasan told Dawn.
He said that martyred constable, Rashid Khan, was leaving his home for work on Sunday morning when armed assailants, who were on a motorcycle, shot him.
Following the incident, a large contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and collected evidence, the spokesperson said. A search operation was also launched to arrest the attackers, he added.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of policemen in the firing incidents in Lakki Marwat and Bannu, a statement issued by the PPP said.
The president paid tribute to the cops’ sacrifices and prayed for their high ranks. “The services and sacrifices of policemen and security forces to establish law and order are worthy of pride,” he was quoted as saying.







Attacks in recent months
Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent days.
Last month, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak. In response to the attack, a large police contingent, including the Counter-Terrorism Department’s commandoes, had launched an operation to hunt down the attackers. Eight terrorists were killed in that operation.
On December 1, two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
In late November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in KP’s Hangu.
Similarly, a police head constable was martyred when unidentified assailants had opened fire at him in Mohammad Akbar village in the jurisdiction of Gul Imam police station of Tank district on November 9.
Prior to that, on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts had rocked Hangu.</p><small>2026-01-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643186-committee-finds-convicted-individuals-entered-punjab-assembly-with-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>'Convicted individuals' entered Punjab Assembly with KP CM</strong></a><br><p>

Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).
Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
“Bangladesh will not go to India to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken this decision today,” Nazrul, who is an adviser to the Ministry of Sports, said in a statement after an emergency meeting of the BCB.
“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”
Earlier, Nazrul had said, “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”
“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.
Nazrul said he had ordered the BCB to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC).
“The board should inform that, where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” he wrote.
“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka.”
Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters.
“I have requested the information and broadcasting adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.
Kolkata Knight Riders, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.
BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“
Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.
The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to soured relations with hosts Pakistan.
Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.
On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.
The ICC and BCB did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p><small>2026-01-04 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04164035cc79839.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965062/uk-says-conducted-joint-strike-with-france-on-is-site-in-syria' target='_blank'><strong>UK says conducted joint strike with France on IS site in Syria</strong></a><br><p>The British Ministry of Defence said it cooperated with France on Saturday night to strike an underground facility in Syria that had likely been used by the militant Islamic State (IS) group to store weapons.
“Royal Air Force aircraft have completed successful strikes against Daesh in a joint operation with France,” the ministry said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for IS.
“This facility had been occupied by Daesh, most likely to store weapons and explosives. The area around the facility is devoid of any civilian habitation,” the statement added.







The ministry said there was no indication the bombing north of the ancient site of Palmyra had posed any risk to civilians.
IS was territorially defeated in Syria in 2019 but still maintains a presence, particularly in the country’s vast desert.
Last month, Washington said a lone IS gunman in Palmyra attacked American personnel, killing two US soldiers and a US civilian.
US forces said they struck dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation.</p><small>2026-01-04 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0408421494c76a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965043/maduro-now-in-new-york-jail-as-trump-says-us-to-run-venezuela' target='_blank'><strong>Maduro now in New York jail as Trump says US to ‘run’ Venezuela</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention centre on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered a US raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves.
As part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, US Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a US Navy ship offshore before flying them to the US.







“We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
For months, his administration criticised Maduro, 63, alleging his involvement in shipping drugs to the US. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats.
Maduro in New York
A plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard.
Images released by US authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a “happy New Year.”







Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official.
It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. US forces have no control over the country, and Maduro’s government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.
We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said, calling Maduro “the only president of Venezuela.” A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president.
Trump has also indicated US troops could be deployed in Venezuela, saying Washington is “not afraid of boots on the ground.”
One aspect that became clearer was Trump’s interest in Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies … go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,” he said.
“We’ll be selling large amounts of oil.”
Trump dismisses opposition leader
US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that “the hour of freedom has arrived”.
She called for the opposition’s 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to “immediately” assume the presidency.







But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela’s new leader, saying she doesn’t have “support or respect” there.
Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”. Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro’s release and vowing to “defend” the country.
Mamdani opposes ‘pursuit of regime change’
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said on Saturday he had called Trump and voiced his opposition to a “pursuit of regime change” in Venezuela.
“I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law,” he said while speaking to reporters.
Separately, in a post on social media platform X, he said he had been briefed about the US military capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City.
“Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law.
“This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,“ he added.







China, North Korea condemn US actions
Venezuela’s ally China initially said it “strongly condemns” the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot “be imposed from outside”.
China’s foreign ministry later said on Sunday that the United States should immediately release Maduro and his wife and resolve the situation in Venezuela through dialogue and negotiation.







The ministry said in a statement on its website that the United States should also ensure the personal safety of Maduro and his wife, saying that their deportation violated international law and norms.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected”.
At Venezuela’s request, the UN Security Council will meet on Monday to discuss the crisis.
While many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela’s 2024 election, Trump’s boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past US interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Some legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow.
Trump said as part of the takeover, major US oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years.
North Korea also denounced the US strikes as “the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty,” state news agency KCNA said today.







“The incident is another example that clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the United States,” KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for North Korea’s foreign ministry.
The statement came after North Korea launched ballistic missiles earlier on Sunday, the day the leader of South Korea begins a state visit to China, Pyongyang’s chief ally.
Pyongyang said the current situation in Venezuela “caused a catastrophic consequence to ensuring the identity of the regional and international relations structure”.
UK seeks peaceful transition to ‘legitimate’ Venezuelan govt
Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK has “long supported a transition of power in Venezuela”.
“We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” he said on X.
“I reiterated my support for international law this morning. The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people.”







Blackout and bombing
Venezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces spent months massing off the coast.
Caracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2am local time (11am PKT). Air strikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour.
The top US military officer, General Dan Caine, said 150 aircraft took part in the operation, supporting troops who choppered in to seize Maduro with the help of months of intelligence into his daily habits — down to “what he ate” and what pets he kept.
Maduro and his wife “gave up” without a struggle, and there was “no loss of US life,” he said.
Venezuelan authorities have yet to release casualty figures. But Trump told the New York Post that “many” Cubans in Maduro’s security detail were killed.
Within hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and the smell of smoke drifting through the streets.



Shifting justifications
The US and numerous European governments did not recognise Maduro’s legitimacy, saying he stole elections in 2018 and 2024.
Maduro — in power since 2013 after taking over from leftist mentor Hugo Chavez — long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Trump has offered several justifications for the aggressive policy toward Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and oil.
But he had previously avoided openly calling for regime change.
Several members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. But Trump’s key ally Mike Johnson, top Republican in the House of Representatives, said it was “justified.”</p><small>2026-01-04 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0413322577d15f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965058/at-least-6-killed-including-a-mother-and-3-daughters-after-dilapidated-roof-collapses-in-kps-charsadda' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 killed, including a mother and 3 daughters, after dilapidated roof collapses in KP’s Charsadda</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least six people were killed, including a mother and three daughters, and five were injured on Sunday after the dilapidated roof of a house collapsed in Shabqadar tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda district, police said.
Per the police, most of the victims were guests who had arrived to attend a wedding ceremony at the house where the incident occurred. The event was scheduled for Sunday evening.
“The incident occurred at around 4am when the dilapidated roof collapsed on the family and guests, prompting the neighbours to rush to the site and manage to pull out the bodies and the injured from the debris,” a statement from the police said.
Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the scene later, launching relief operations and shifting the injured and deceased to the hospital.
The bodies and injured were shifted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Shabqadar, the statement added.
Roof collapses are largely caused by substandard construction, use of poor-quality materials, and lack of enforcement of building codes.
Ageing structures, illegal extensions, and heavy rains further weaken roofs, making collapses more likely.
In November last year, a roof collapse also killed five members of a family, including four children, in the Pabbi area of Nowshera district.</p><small>2026-01-04 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04151837e1ddcbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965064/prime-suspect-confesses-to-killing-woman-and-her-3-children-dumping-bodies-in-pit-off-karachis-mai-kolachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Prime suspect confesses to killing woman and her 3 children, dumping bodies in pit off Karachi’s Mai Kolachi: police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Police have arrested the prime suspect accused of killing four people whose partially decomposed bodies were found in a pit off Karachi’s Mai Kolachi Road earlier this week, authorities said on Sunday, adding that the suspect had confessed to the crime.
According to police, the four bodies — of a woman and her three children — were recovered from a pit off Mai Kolachi Road on Friday night in the limits of the Docks police station. Police said the bodies had marks of torture, and the deceased appeared to have been killed with an axe or another sharp-edged object.
A statement by the office of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said today the prime suspect in the case had been arrested by Kaemari police and had confessed to the crime during interrogation.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Asad Raza also confirmed the development to Dawn, saying that digital forensics of the mobile of the deceased woman had established that the suspect had been in contact with her.
“He wanted to get rid of her,” the DIG said.
Police also shared a video of the suspect, in which he said he had been friends with the deceased woman for a long time.
The suspect alleged that she had been using black magic and would often make demands, due to which he was under mental pressure.
“She would take me to people who practice black magic,” he alleged, adding that she had taken him to one such individual on Tuesday night as well.
He said he had decided by then that “either I will kill myself or her”, adding that he killed her and then dumped her body in a pit.
The suspect added that he then went to her mother’s house, took her children — who too would often make demands and “pressurise” him — killed them and dumped their bodies in the same pit.
He said he killed them because they had seen him leaving the house with their mother.
The statement from Lanjar office said he had lauded Kaemari Senior Superintendent of Police Amjad Shaikh and his team for the suspect’s arrest.
FIR
On Saturday, the Docks police registered a first information report (FIR) of the incident under Sections 302 (premediated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown persons for brutally killing the woman and her three children.
The case was registered on behalf of the state through police officer Mohammed Azhar.
The complainant narrated the recovery of the bodies and said in the FIR that “the circumstances give rise to suspicions that the victims were killed elsewhere and their bodies were later dumped in a dried manhole”.</p><small>2026-01-04 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/041116243a0c65b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054/unsc-to-meet-on-monday-amid-alarm-over-us-action-in-venezuela-concerns-about-risks-to-international-system' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC to meet on Monday amid alarm over US action in Venezuela, concerns about risks to international system</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday amid mounting international alarm over the United States’ military action in Venezuela and concerns that the crisis has now moved beyond bilateral tensions.
On Saturday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the crisis in Venezuela could undermine the foundations of international law by setting a “dangerous precedent“ for similar actions in the near future.
The meeting was requested by Colombia and supported by China and the Russian Federation, with Venezuela also formally appealing to the Council. According to the Council presidency, the session will be held under the agenda item “Threats to International Peace and Security,” and the secretary general is expected to brief the members.
In a statement issued through his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, Secretary General Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela, culminating with today’s (Saturday) United States military action in the country, which has potential worrying implications for the region.”
The statement added: “Independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent.“
“The secretary general continues to emphasise the importance of full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter,” Dujarric said. “He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.”
Beyond bilateral tensions
The decision to convene the Council reflects a growing view among several UN members that the crisis has moved beyond bilateral tensions and now poses broader risks to regional stability and the international system itself.
The US operation, carried out overnight on Saturday, marks the most direct American military intervention in Latin America in decades. Washington has framed the action as a decisive move against an authoritarian leader accused of narco-terrorism and criminal activity.
US President Donald Trump publicly confirmed the operation, adding that the United States would “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” signalling an interim American role in Venezuela’s governance.
For many governments, however, the manner of Maduro’s removal — rather than his record — lies at the heart of the controversy.
The secretary-general’s office has stressed that even severe political crises do not negate the legal restraints imposed by the UN Charter.
“Full respect — by all — of international law” remains essential, Dujarric said, warning that departures from those principles weaken the rules-based international order.
Venezuela has sharply condemned the US action, describing it as a violation of sovereignty and an act of aggression. In a letter to the Security Council, Venezuela’s UN ambassador Samuel Moncada wrote that the operation amounted to “a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people,” and at imposing “a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves.”
Moncada cited the UN Charter directly, recalling that it states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
China and Russia have echoed those concerns in unusually blunt language. China’s foreign ministry said it was “deeply shocked and strongly condemns the use of force by the US against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country.” It added that China “firmly opposes such hegemonic behaviour by the US, which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela’s sovereignty, and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean,” and called on Washington to “abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.”
Russia’s foreign ministry described the operation as an act of aggression. “This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela,” it said, adding that “the pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded.” Moscow warned that Latin America must remain “a zone of peace” and insisted that Venezuela be allowed “to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.”
Both Beijing and Moscow have stressed that their objections are rooted not in support for Maduro personally, but in the defence of what they describe as core principles of international law.
Reactions across Latin America have been shaped by a long history of external intervention. While some governments have welcomed Maduro’s removal as the end of a repressive era, others have warned that the US action risks renewed instability. Colombia, which requested the Council meeting, has highlighted concerns about border security and possible displacement.
At the legal level, the episode has revived debates about the limits of unilateral action. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter requires member states to refrain from the use of force except in self-defence or with Security Council authorisation. Critics argue that neither condition clearly applies in this case, and that criminal indictments or law-enforcement objectives do not constitute a recognised legal basis for military intervention.
The concern articulated by Guterres and echoed by several Council members is that normalising such actions could erode the already fragile consensus around international law. If powerful states are seen as free to remove foreign leaders by force without multilateral approval, diplomats warn that the principle of sovereign equality risks being hollowed out.
Expected positions inside the council
Inside the Council chamber, diplomats expect sharp divisions that mirror public statements already on record. The UN Secretariat is likely to reiterate the secretary general’s warning that the situation “constitutes a dangerous precedent” and that “full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter” remains essential.
China is expected to repeat its position that the use of force against Venezuela “seriously violates international law” and threatens regional peace, while Russia is expected to maintain that the action amounts to “armed aggression” and that Latin America must remain “a zone of peace.”
Venezuela is likely to press its argument that the operation violated the Charter’s prohibition on the use of force and amounted to a “colonial war.” The United States, for its part, is expected to defend the operation on security and criminal grounds, while opposing any Council outcome that characterises the action as unlawful.
Historical parallels and legal context
The debate has revived memories of earlier unilateral interventions that divided the Security Council, including Panama in 1989 and Iraq in 2003, where legality, legitimacy and precedent became central points of contention. In each case, opponents argued that bypassing the Council weakened the collective security framework, while supporters argued that exceptional circumstances justified exceptional measures.
What distinguishes the current case, diplomats note, is the explicit removal and detention of a sitting head of state, raising questions about whether international law is being reshaped by practice rather than consensus. For critics, the concern is that repeated departures from the UN Charter restraints may gradually normalise actions once considered extraordinary.
The Security Council meeting is therefore expected to do little to bridge differences, but much to place competing interpretations on the record. Any resolution critical of the United States is likely to face a veto, limiting formal outcomes. Still, diplomats say the debate itself matters, as it will shape how this episode is cited in future crises.
Beyond New York, Venezuela faces an uncertain transition. Maduro’s capture by the US has created a political vacuum, and questions remain about governance, legitimacy and public consent. Regional governments are watching closely for humanitarian fallout and renewed migration pressures.
In that sense, the crisis is no longer only about Venezuela or the United States. It has become a test of whether the post-war system designed to restrain the use of force can still command respect — or whether, as several diplomats fear, it is steadily being eroded by unilateral action justified by power and expediency.</p><small>2026-01-04 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04140451cc5aa48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965059/fm-dar-meets-chinese-dignitaries-in-beijing-ahead-of-strategic-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets Chinese dignitaries in Beijing ahead of strategic dialogue</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar held meetings with Chinese dignitaries in Beijing on Sunday, with exchanges mainly focusing on bilateral ties, according to statements issued by the Foreign Office (FO).
Dar reached Beijing on Sat­urday, primarily to co-chair the seventh round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue, which is scheduled for today, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
The FO said in a statement on social media platform X today that the foreign minister also met Chinese Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang today.







“The two sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepening the Pakistan–China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership,” the statement said, adding that the Chinese executive vice premier “appreciated Pakistan’s consistent support to China on issues of core interest”.
Both leaders noted the historic significance of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between their countries and agreed to utilise this milestone to chart a forward-looking vision for enhanced cooperation, including under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the statement said.
Vice Premier Ding conveyed New Year greetings to the leadership and people of Pakistan, it added.
A separate statement by the FO earlier today said Dar also met Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Liu Haixing.
Dar congratulated Minister Liu on the successful convening of the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, the statement said.







It added that the two sides “expressed satisfaction with the steady and forward-looking trajectory of bilateral relations while reviewing party-to-party exchanges, regional developments, and progress on various projects under CPEC”.
They also agreed to jointly commemorate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China in a “befitting and meaningful manner”.
Dar, who is visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi, was received at the airport by China’s Special Representative on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Pakistan’s ambassador to China and officials from the Pak­istani Embassy.
What will the dialogue cover?
Apart from the  Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue, he will also attend events marking the beginning of the 75th year of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties, with both countries planning initiatives and commemorative activities throughout 2026, the FO previously said.
The dialogue, meanwhile, will review the full spectrum of bilateral cooperation, identify new areas of partnership, and further advance the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China, the FO said.
It was the “highest consultative mechanism betw­een Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
The FO said that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
It had added that the visit formed an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflected their shared determination to broaden and deepen their cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in Aug­ust, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Pres­ident Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2026-01-04 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643137-four-policemen-martyred-in-two-kp-gun-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Four policemen martyred in two KP gun attacks</strong></a><br><p>

Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death.
Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as gono-pituni, have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2025, South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well.
The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities.
Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age.

From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage

The 2017 lynching of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university.
This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing.
Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement.
Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone.

 

Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community.
Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions.
But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘weiwen [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority.
The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks. In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching.



Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs.
Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink.
But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence.
This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market.
Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation.
While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty.
Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement.
However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing.
The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence.
Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.

Hospital officials confirmed her death, describing it as the end of an era for eye care in Pakistan.
Dr Lall served at Christian Hospital, Taxila, for over 50 years, providing low-cost, high-quality eye care to millions, particularly the poor.
Widely recognised as Pakistan’s first female ophthalmologist, she is also believed to have conducted the highest number of eye surgeries by any woman ophthalmologist in Asia.
Born in Nagpur, India, in 1932, Dr Pramila graduated from the prestigious Christian Medical College, Vellore, in 1957. During her student years, fate introduced her to Dr Ernest Lall, a Pakistani national. Their marriage brought her to Pakistan the same year, where she joined Christian Hospital, Taxila.
She earned her Diploma in Ophthalmology from London in 1964, becoming Pakistan’s first woman specialist in the field. Her excellence was recognised internationally when she was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in 1980 and later nominated as an international member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in 1987.
In 1976, she once again made history by becoming the first woman in Pakistan to perform intraocular implant surgery.
A founder member of the Rawalpindi chapter of the Ophthalmological Society of Pakistan, Dr Lall trained generations of national and international doctors in eye surgery and clinical ophthalmology.
She served on the National Steering Committee for the Prevention of Blindness and played a central role in running postgraduate training programmes as head of the ophthalmology department.
Her selfless service earned her numerous accolades, including the prestigious Paul Harrison Award in 1983 for meritorious services to the blind, and the Tamgha-i-Imtiaz in 2002, conferred by then president Pervez Musharraf. According to Dr Nadeem Davaid, administrator of Christian Hospital, her last rites are expected to be held on Tuesday following the arrival of her three children from abroad. She will be laid to rest within the hospital premises beside her late husband, Dr Ernest Lall’s grave.

Don’t get me wrong. As a long-term believer in political reconciliation being crucial to creating the right environment for investment in the economy to grow it and to reduce the scale of abject poverty in the country, I would like to believe Rana Sanaullah’s suggestion is a viable one and could form the basis for dialogue. But is it?

 

First of all, let’s see what he meant by the big five. In a TV interview, he spelt it out as “my leaders” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari, former prime minister-PTI founder Imran Khan and “you know who the fifth is” without naming anyone. His list of those who may need to smoke the peace pipe points to the fate of his suggestion.
As far as the establishment is concerned, the military spokesman has been on record saying that his institution is not the one to engage in a dialogue with the imprisoned leader and if the latter desired talks, the government should be approached.
For his part, Imran Khan has also so far unequivocally stated that he sees no point in talks with the government and the only meaningful dialogue that’s possible is directly with the military establishment as it is the sole decision-maker.
So, for Rana Sahib’s suggestion to gain traction, two of his ‘big five’ players will need to shift from their current positions and unless he knows something about a change of mind in either one or both quarters, a headway can be wished but not evidenced.

Unless Rana Sanaullah knows something about a change of mind in either one or both quarters, a headway can be wished but not evidenced.

If we zoom out of the tight focus, any attempt at reconciliation seems even more unlikely, simply because Imran Khan has taken a maximalist position, whether you agree with him or not, that he was cheated out of power in the February 2024 elections and any discussion or dialogue must include a pathway straight back to power for him.
Regardless of the merit of his argument, the ground reality can be gauged from the passage of the 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution, with yet another one, the 28th, said to be around the corner, as well as from last May’s clash with India, leading to the elevation to field marshal and Chief of Defence Forces, of the four-star army chief in addition to his own role.
Observers note that he is now more comfortably ensconced in power than ever before, and as one journalist said, he has taken Pakistan from a pariah state to a player on the regional and global stage. No matter how precarious that status may be, given the fickle nature of US President Trump’s temperament, he still mentions with ‘admiration’, ‘my favourite field marshal’, and for now it weighs heavily in the latter’s favour.
As far as the civilian part of the hybrid set-up is concerned, it knows well what the ground reality was before, during and after the 2024 elections, and how it came into sharing some power and glory too after the May 2025 clash with India. The civilian part so far seems to have made little headway in the one thing it was apparently tasked to accomplish by the senior partner.
And that was to prepare a viable alternative to PTI’s narrative, with the latter having taken a head start and maintaining its lead — and here facts don’t matter half as much as what the support base is willing to believe.
The government is still struggling, though one can see the effort and the expenditure that is going into the area. It still needs time to catch up, if at all it can.
It can only hope that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s administration is able to deliver over the term of the current parliament in its support base, the country’s most populous province, and revive the PML-N’s fortunes, and that elections are not held before that for whatever reason.

 

I suspect it will have to live with the fear that its fate in Punjab may mirror the PPP’s when PML-N itself displaced it. Once the electorate’s hearts and minds have been lost, the fall from grace has a degree of permanence to it; performance and governance, too, matter to a point and not beyond. Perceptions matter more.
One need only look at the abysmal performance of the Usman Buzdar government in Punjab during the PTI’s time in power. The PTI support in the province has more to do with the success of the narrative of being wronged rather than its performance and governance whilst in office.
At the end of the day, the state of the economy affects everyone. The team of economic managers may have stabilised the economy, but investment, growth and job creation are still insignificant. MoUs don’t translate into positive economy numbers. Local and foreign investors remain risk-averse and there can be no perceived risk greater than the uncertainty triggered by political upheaval.
Politics is the art of the possible. But in our case, uncertainty will remain till principles and personal issues, as manifest in unsavoury attacks, are not separated; till all those in government or in opposition are willing to show accommodation. In asking each party to step back from confrontation, I have faced criticism from those who say I am equating usurpers with victims.
I am not. All I am saying is that you have tried and failed to effect change via street power. Recent court verdicts lend credence to this view. Is it time to try a change of political strategy to take a different route to your goals? If you think it isn’t, then any reconciliation is a pipe dream.

A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Hasan Naqvi, deliberated on various issues, including the parking problem of goods transporters, the issuance of HTV licences and registration for insurance.
The meeting was attended, among others, by Karachi police chief Azad Khan, Transport Secretary Asad Zaman and DIG Traffic Peer Mohammad Shah, and representatives of the Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance, United Goods Transport Alliance and Karachi Goods Carrier Association.
After the meeting, the commissioner told Dawn that the lane would be marked with clear “HTV” signage and painted lines, and heavy vehicles would be permitted to travel only within this lane once the markings were completed.
He said that the meeting focused on the persistent parking problems faced by goods transporters, the cumbersome process of issuing HTV licences, and the need for improved registration and insurance mechanisms for commercial vehicles.
Mr Naqvi warned that any heavy vehicle found deviating from the designated lane or exceeding the 30km/h speed limit would face strict action.
The officials said that a detailed review of the challenges confronting Karachi’s freight sector was conducted as rapid urban expansion had left limited space for trucks to load, unload or park.
They said that the limited parking space had forced many vehicles to occupy side streets and informal lots, which in turn creates bottlenecks, hampers traffic flow and raises safety concerns.
The officials said that it was decided that coordinated efforts would be made to resolve the parking problem of goods transporters, and that a proposed terminal for their vehicles — intended to provide secure parking, maintenance bays and customs clearance points — would be examined further.
The meeting decided that a dedicated HTV lane would be allocated for heavy vehicles on the corridor from Mai Kolachi to Qayyumabad Bridge.

Police said the four bodies, which were found at a desolate spot within the jurisdiction of the Docks police station, bore marks of torture and appeared to have been killed with an axe or another sharp-edged object.
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the victims were identified as Anila, 35, her two sons, Husain Ali, 12, and Konain Ali, 10, and daughter Kishwara Zehra, 13.
He said Anila got divorced from Mukhtar Ali and on Dec 30, 2025 she rented a house in Kharadar.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the victims were killed around four to five days ago. She said the corpses were brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi where medico-legal formalities were completed late on Friday night.
The three children suffered multiple injuries in the head, face and neck, while their mother was bludgeoned to death.
“All relevant samples have been collected for intoxication and sexual violence,” said the police surgeon.
FIR lodged
On Saturday, the Docks police registered an FIR under Sections 302 (premediated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown persons for brutally killing the woman and her three children.
The case was registered on behalf of the state through police officer Mohammed Azhar.
The complainant narrated the recovery of the bodies and said in the FIR that “the circumstances give rise to suspicions that the victims were killed elsewhere and their bodies were later dumped in a dried manhole”.
Meanwhile, DIG Raza said there was no CCTV coverage in the deserted area of the Mai Kolachi.
He observed that the injuries on the head and neck of the victims appeared to have been inflicted with an axe and other sharp-edge weapons/instruments.
He suspected that the gruesome murders might be an outcome of the killing in the name of so-called honour.

The change in the US attitude towards Pakistan began early this year, even before the May stand-off with India, when American President Donald Trump and Centcom chief Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan’s contribution to the war against terrorism and thanked the country for handing over the mastermind of the Abbey Gate terrorist attack by IS-K to the US.
Here lies Pakistan’s real strength: while engaged in a prolonged war against terrorism and dealing with multiple strands of terrorist groups, including the Taliban, who now rule Afghanistan, the country has gained experience in managing global threats and winning the trust of international partners.
Action against IS-K opened several doors for Pakistan in regional and defence cooperation with many Muslim countries, including the much-discussed Pak-Saudi defence pact. It remains to be seen how far these engagements will go and whether Pakistan can translate them into tangible economic and political gains.

In the absence of authentic official data, research groups rely heavily on open sources.

However, the internal security front has become more critical, as religiously motivated terrorist groups and Baloch sub-national militant organisations continue to thrive, complicating the country’s security challenges.
State institutions responsible for addressing internal security challenges and terrorism threats have failed to provide authentic statistics on terrorist activities and the state’s response to them. The official body tasked with this responsibility, the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), offers little substance on its website beyond a list of proscribed organisations; the rest consists of claims without supporting evidence. At times, provincial law-enforcement agencies issue figures, but these efforts are inconsistent and lack detail. ISPR frequently conducts media briefings and presents statistics, but beyond numbers, substantive details of counterterrorism operations are rarely provided.
Law-enforcement agencies cite various justifications, often claiming that while they compile data, they do not make it public because it may be legally contested. Such claims will be questioned unless tested. Meanwhile, several private research organisations perform this function by publishing periodic and annual reports on terrorism trends in the country.
These research groups face their own constraints. In the absence of an authentic official database, they rely heavily on open sources. Such information typically comes from ISPR press releases and, in some cases, provincial law-enforcement agencies. Another source is the monthly and annual statistics issued by terrorist organisations themselves. These groups exaggerate their operations, but without an official database, it becomes difficult to fully refute their claims.
Organisations compiling terrorism-related data in Pakistan generally follow two approaches: some rely exclusively on officially confirmed media reports, while others cross-check with data released by terrorist organisations. Verification on the ground has become nearly impossible, as local media in conflict zones often cannot report incidents, and even when reports reach newsrooms, editors tend to prioritise official press releases.
The purpose of outlining the background of terrorism-related data compilation is twofold: first, to show that Pakistan has faced severe terrorism for decades yet still lacks an authentic database; and second, to highlight that data compiled by various organisations shows fluctuations. Nevertheless, a review of reports released this year reveals a serious trend: the terrorist threat is worsening, not only in operational terms but also in terms of ideological, political and tactical realignments.
For instance, an annual security report issued by the Pak Institute for Studies and Peace Studies, which has been conducting this assessment since 2005, reported a sharp surge in militant violence in 2025. A total of 699 terrorist attacks were recorded nationwide, an increase of 34 per cent compared to the previous year.
This renewed wave of violence claimed at least 1,034 lives, marking a 21pc rise in terrorism-related fatalities. In addition, 1,366 people were injured during the year, underscoring the growing human cost of terrorism.
The report notes that security and law-enforcement personnel bore the brunt of the violence. Of the total fatalities recorded, 437, or more than 42pc, were personnel from security and law-enforcement agencies, including 174 policemen, 122 soldiers, 107 FC members (Frontier Corps and Federal Constabulary), 21 Levies personnel, 12 paramilitary troops, and one Rangers official. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants killed. Meanwhile, 243 militants died either in suicide attacks or during retaliatory fire by security forces.

 

Balochistan and KP’s tribal districts remain the most critical regions. These developments triggered coercive responses by security forces against terrorist hideouts across the border and led to heightened tensions with Afghanistan, which Pakistan accuses of hosting and supporting terrorist groups, including TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army.
The success graph of Pakistan’s security forces also remained high last year, with 2025 recording the highest number of terrorists killed in a single year. Nonetheless, Pakistan seeks international acknowledgment of these successes. However, the rising number of terrorist attacks indicates that while the kinetic approach is yielding results, the non-kinetic approach is not adequately complementing military operations.
A weak non-kinetic framework is evident in the state’s inability to develop a verifiable terrorism database, even as state institutions expect Pakistan not to be ranked highly in global terrorism databases.
Nacta and law-enforcement agencies in Pakistan hardly grasp that the most reputable global organisations require verifiable data, yet Pakistan’s LEAs insist that the world should simply believe their claims. Despite this, Pakistan faced difficulties with the FATF due to the submission of non-verifiable data, and it remained on the grey list until the country presented improved statistics.

No doubt, the violence that followed the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan, including attacks on military and state installations, crossed several red lines. Similarly, much of the digital commentary circulating at the time was excessive, speculative, irresponsible and, in cases, non-factual. While criticism by some of the convicted had not breached acceptable bounds, the others had cultivated audiences through sensationalism, half-truths and a combative tone that blurred the line between opinion and incitement. This deserves criticism. Freedom of expression does not grant a licence to spread disinformation or inflame passions during moments of crisis.
It is also worth recalling the irony that several of these voices were once prominent cheerleaders for PTI during its ascent, attacking its political opponents, including Nawaz Sharif and his party, without attracting similar legal scrutiny from the state. The selective nature of accountability weakens the moral authority of the state’s actions. Yet acknowledging these realities does not make the sentence any less unsettling.
Handing out life terms to journalists and bloggers, following trials in absentia and under the sweeping ambit of anti-terrorism laws, is disproportionate to the alleged offences of speech and commentary. Measured legal remedies were available. Where content was defamatory, demonstrably false or malicious, civil defamation proceedings or narrow criminal charges could have addressed the harm without invoking the most extreme state instruments.
By choosing the harshest path, the authorities risk setting a precedent that may threaten legitimate journalism and dissent far beyond the individuals involved. Stability is linked to maintaining a fair justice system. A secure state should be able to confront irresponsible speech without resorting to excessive penalties.

The firings of at least two missiles, the country’s first in two months, further heighten global tensions after US President Donald Trump launched the attack that captured President Nicolas Maduro.
South Korea said peace on the Korean peninsula would be on the agenda during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to Beijing, which will include a summit with his counterpart, Xi Jinping.
The launches from the capital Pyongyang into the sea between the Koreas and Japan represent “a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China’s stance on denuclearisation”, said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.
North Korea signals ‘we are different from Venezuela’
Eul-chul said North Korea also wanted to send a message that “we are different from Venezuela” — as a nuclear and military power, ready to respond with “aggressive deterrence”.
Referring to North Korea‘s leader Kim Jong Un, Bong Youngshik, a visiting professor at Yonsei University, said: “After seeing what’s happening in Venezuela right now, the person who would be most afraid is Kim Jong Un.”
Seoul and Tokyo criticised the missile launches.
South Korea’s presidential office said it had held an emergency security meeting and urged North Korea to cease “provocative acts that violate United Nations Security Council resolutions”.
Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the launches threaten the peace and security of the neighbouring country, the region and the international community.
“Our government lodged a strong protest with North Korea and strongly condemned it,” Koizumi said in a statement.
US forces for the Indo-Pacific said in a statement, “This event does not pose an immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to our allies,” adding the US was consulting closely with its allies and partners.







Kim Jong Un flexing military muscles before party congress
The missiles, launched around 7:50am (2250 GMT on Saturday), flew about 900 kilometres, South Korea’s military said. Japan said there were at least two missiles that flew about 900 km and 950 km.
The last time Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile was on November 7.
On Saturday, Kim Jong Un called for more than doubling the production capacity of tactical guided weapons during a visit to a munitions factory, North Korea’s state media reported.
In recent weeks, Kim has made a series of visits to weapons factories, as well as to a nuclear-powered submarine, and has overseen missile tests ahead of this year’s Ninth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party, which will set out major policy goals.
South Korea expects Beijing to play a role in promoting peace on the Korean peninsula, said Wi Sung-lac, Lee’s security adviser, without elaborating on details of the summit agenda.

According to the Indian Express newspaper, police initiated a 14-day preliminary inquiry after the video circulated on social media, purportedly showing Furqanul Haq, a resident of Pulwama, wearing the helmet during a local league match in Jammu.
Police said the inquiry was ordered in view of the “sensitivity of the matter and its potential public order implications” and would examine the facts, the cricketer’s intent, and any possible linkages.
Under the law, police can conduct preliminary inquiries with prior permission from a deputy superintendent of police for cognisable offences punishable by three to seven years of imprisonment.
The controversy occurred during a match of the Jammu and Kashmir Champions League at Muthi, 10 kilometres from Jammu, after Furqan walked in to bat for his team, JK Eleven Kings, against Jammu Trail Blazers.
A Times of India (TOI) report stated some players from the opposing side objected to the helmet sticker, following which Furqanul Haq was sent back and took no further part in the match.
Both Furqan and the organisers of the tournament were later called to a police station for questioning.
The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association distanced itself from the episode. “The JKCA has nothing to do with this. It involves local players. Even spectators are not allowed. Police will take necessary action,” an official told the TOI.
Support for Palestinian cause
The controversy drew political reactions. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti expressed support for the Palestinian cause on social media.
“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. A flag in the wind, bold and free, from the river to the sea,” she posted on X.

With protests against economic hardships turning into a bout of serious civil unrest in Iran, US President Donald Trump had on Friday issued an unwarranted threat to “respond” if Iran’s security forces killed protesters, prompting Tehran to respond with the ‘warning’ that such a development would destabilise the entire region. What was being said between the lines does not need to be spelt out for anyone.

 

The two countries had come face to face during the Twelve-Day War between Iran and Israel in June this past year, when the US had bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, and Iran had retaliated by hitting America’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar before a ceasefire was reached.
Unsurprisingly, Israel also features prominently in the recent flare-up between them.
But Mr Trump’s interventionist aspirations have not been limited to Iran.
On Saturday, after a night of bombs and terror in Venezuela, the US president announced on his social media platform that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been captured and flown out of the country.
A US official later told the media that special forces troops had taken part in America’s first direct intervention in Latin America since 1989.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Maduro had just days ago attempted to engage with Mr Trump on narco-trafficking and illegal migration, both of which had been sore issues in Mr Trump’s relationship with his southern neighbour. However, Mr Maduro personally believed that Mr Trump was really after Venezuela’s considerable oil reserves — a perception that was reinforced by multiple leaders from the Trump administration making varying claims on Venezuela’s resources.

 

The Venezuelan context is important for Iran and, indeed, the Middle East. It establishes that there are no limits or international laws when the powerful decide to seize what they want.
There is no doubt that the Iranian people are unhappy with their government for the economic misery they have been suffering. But whatever their grievances, they are for the people of Iran to settle amongst themselves.
That Israel is attempting to fan the unrest and the US is publicly providing guarantees to protesters suggests that the old playbook is being used again: yet another country is to be destabilised as an insurance policy for the state of Israel. The wider region and Iran’s neighbours, in particular, should take a stand against such interventionism, lest they want chaos and unrest at their own doorsteps.
Whatever the Iranian government’s failings, it has kept order despite being placed under immense economic strain by those now pretending to be friends of its people.

While securing visas for Arab countries is getting tough, local authorities have also adopted strict rules to check the exodus of skilled and unskilled workers.
A recruiting agent said getting a visa has become very difficult while double checking for a job seeker on a work visa has made success almost impossible.
“For even lowest paid jobs, delegations come to Pakistan for personal verification and they carry out detailed scrutiny, reducing the chance for overseas jobs,” according to an official working for a recruiting agency.
The country received record inflows of $38 billion in remittances in FY25, a definitive indicator that most of the 1.5 million Pakistanis who have left the country over the last three years, found jobs in Middle Eastern countries.
Growth in remittances is already much lower this year (FY26) than the figures for last year (FY25), but the amount of remittances is higher. During July-Nov FY26 growth in remittances was 9.3 per cent, compared to 33.6 per cent during the same period of last fiscal year.
The government has chalked out a strategy to assist Pakistanis find jobs overseas and to gain a first-hand insight into the challenges confronting them overseas. However, the exchange companies also mentioned the problem with the new job seekers.
Thousands of beggars were arrested last year, particularly in Saudi Arabia and most of them were Pakistanis. It damaged the country’s reputation and increased concerns in countries providing jobs.
The malaise alerted the Saudi Authorities as well as Pakistani authorities. Now immigrants face tough scrutiny in both the countries — Pakistan and the destination.
51,000 offloaded
In mid-December, a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis was informed that 51,000 passengers were offloaded at Pakistani airports this year after failing immigration checks.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed the lives of several Pakistanis.
“So far the symptoms of decline in inflows have not appeared, but will appear sooner or later,” said a source in the financial market.
Another problem is that unskilled workers are no longer needed in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries due to increasing influx from other countries. Moreover, Arab countries have started providing as many jobs to their own citizens as possible.
“Only high-skilled labourers or experts in Information Technology have a chance to get a job in the coming months and years,” said the source.
Dozens of Pakistani IT companies shifted to Dubai last year due to poor internet facilities, high cost of electricity and uncertainty in the country — both economic and political.

Earlier, Israel confirmed it suspended the organisations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials.
Israeli authorities said the lists are now officially required for “security” reasons to prevent bodies it accuses of supporting terrorism from operating in the Palestinian territories.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, called the demand a “scandalous intrusion”, though Israel contends the measure is needed to stop Palestinians from “infiltrating humanitarian structures”.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Friday for Israel to end the ban, saying he was “deeply concerned” by the development.

UN chief calls on Tel Aviv to reverse its decision

Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the secretary-general, said Guterres “calls for this measure to be reversed, stressing that international nongovernmental organisations are indispensable to life-saving humanitarian work and that the suspension risks undermining the fragile progress made during the ceasefire.”
“This recent action will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians,” Ms Dujarric added.
NGOs included in the ban have been ordered to cease their operations by March 1.
“To work in Palestine, in the occupied Palestinian territories, we have to be registered. … That registration expired on Dec 31, 2025,” Isabelle Defourny, a physician and president of MSF France while speaking to France Inter said.
“Since July 2025, we have been involved in a re-registration process and to date, we have not received a response,” she said. “We still have 60 days during which we could work without being re-registered, and so we would have to end our activities in March” if Israel maintains the decision.
Ms Defourny said the Israeli decision is explained by the fact that NGOs “bear witness to the violence committed by the Israeli army” in Gaza.
MSF has roughly 1,200 staff members in the Palestinian territories — the majority in Gaza — including 40 international staff and some 800 Palestinian staff working across eight hospitals.
“We are the second-largest distributor of water (in the Gaza Strip),” Ms Defourny said. “Last year, in 2025, we treated just over 100,000 people who were wounded, burned, or victims of various traumas. We are second in terms of the number of deliveries performed.”
Several NGOs have said the new requirements contravene international humanitarian law or endanger their independence.
On Thursday, 18 Israel-based left-wing NGOs denounced the ban on their international peers, stating that “the new registration framework violates core humanitarian principles of independence and neutrality”.
The ban comes amid a fragile ceasefire in place since October, following the war waged by Israel in Gaza.
In November, authorities in Gaza said more than 70,000 people had been killed by Tel Aviv’s military. According to UN data, nearly 80 per cent of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, leaving infrastructure decimated.
About 1.5 million of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents have lost their homes, said Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza.

ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has launched ‘International Year of the Woman Farmer 2026’, a global campaign aimed at recognising women’s indispensable yet often overlooked contributions to global agrifood systems and to galvanising efforts to close persistent gender gaps.
Women make up a significant proportion of the world’s agricultural workforce and play a central role across agrifood value chains — from production and processing to distribution and trade — while also ensuring household food security and nutrition. In 2021, agrifood systems employed 40 per cent of working women globally— nearly equal to men.
Despite their vital role, women’s contributions remain undervalued and their working conditions are often more precarious: irregular, informal, part-time, low-paid work that is labour-intensive and highly vulnerable. Women continue to face systemic barriers, including limited access to land, finance, technologies, education, extension services and participation in decision-making at all levels.
In Pakistan, approximately 74 per cent of women and girls engaged in the labour force work in the agriculture sector, which generates about 40pc of household income. However, protection issues faced by women farmers remain poorly documented and insufficiently addressed.
An FAO report on women farmers in Pakistan highlights the need to amend labour and agriculture policies at the federal and provincial levels to recognise all women performing work related to crops, fruits, vegetables, livestock, fisheries, poultry, dairy, forestry and post-harvest production as “farmers”, whether they work full-time or part-time, including those working on family farms without land ownership.
The report recommends setting a minimum wage for women farmers and ensuring wage parity with male agricultural workers for work of equal value. It also calls for the allocation of unused federal and provincial land to landless rural women farmers, along with access to water and input subsidies to support sustainable livelihoods.
Designated by the UN General Assembly in 2024, the International Year aims to highlight the challenges faced by women farmers and drive policy reforms and investment to advance gender equality, emp­ower women and build more resilient agrifood systems. FAO, in collaboration with the Rome-based UN agencies — the International Fund for Agricultural Develo­pment (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) — will coordinate activities throughout 2026.
Recent FAO reports, The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems and The Unjust Climate, reveal that women farmers typically cultivate smaller landholdings than men and face a 24pc productivity gap even on farms of equal size. Each day of extreme heat reduces the total value of crops produced by women farmers by three per cent compared to men.

The conference is being organised under the banner of a recently formed National Dialogue Committee (NDC) set up by ex-PTI leaders, including Fawad Chaudhry, Dr Shahzad Waseem and former Sindh governor Imran Ismail.
Organisers said the event would bring together political leaders as well as lawyers, intellectuals and technocrats from across the country.
Invitations will be sent to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), PTI, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI). The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), Awami National Party (ANP) and other parties will also be invited.
The NDC will also extend a special invitation to Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail and Mahmood Moulvi, who formed the committee, have begun contacting political leaders to extend invitations.

National Dialogue Committee to invite lawyers, intellectuals for talks

The organisers said the conference aimed to explore a way out of the political crisis and build harmony among national political parties. Mr Chaudhry said that bringing together all schools of thought on national matters was “the need of the hour” and that the goal was to develop consensus on key political issues.

 

Last month, the group formally approached Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking the release on parole of senior PTI figures detained in Kot Lakhpat Jail, arguing their participation was essential to make any dialogue process credible and productive.
In a letter sent to the prime minister on Dec 23, the committee welcomed PM Shehbaz’s renewed offer of talks with the opposition, particularly PTI, and described it as a “golden opportunity” to stabilise the country amid deepening political, economic and institutional challenges.
Interestingly, the letter did not mention PTI founder Imran Khan, focusing instead on senior party leaders outside Adiala jail to initiate and sustain a dialogue process.
It also sought the rele­ase on parole of PTI leaders held in Kot Lakhpat Jail, including Shah Mah­mood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmo­odur Rasheed and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry.
The committee said talks could only succeed if they began with tangible confidence-building measures.

MUKALLA : Yemen’s Saudi-backed and internationally recognised government said on Saturday it had retaken control of Mukalla, the key eastern port in Yemen and capital of Hadramaut province, from separatists who seized it last month.
The rapid government gains since Friday have reversed many of the advances made by the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and cast doubt on viability of its intention to hold a referendum on “independence”.
As the fighting threatened to upend the regional order, the United Arab Emirates urged de-escalation, saying it was “deeply concerned” by the violence. Saudi Arabia appealed for factions to convene for talks in Riyadh.
Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had made advances and taken control of key locations in Hadramaut, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border.
By Saturday, military officials announced that “all military and civilian facilities” in Mukalla, the provincial capital, had “been secured”. An official said the military had seized the city’s principal military base.
The STC confirmed the loss of territory. An STC official said there had been a “retreat of our forces” from the Al-Khasha area following “intense” Saudi airstrikes.
The official said a separate strike on the Barshid camp, west of Mukalla, resulted in fatalities. He did not provide a specific number.
Witnesses in Mukalla described a breakdown in security accompanied by looting, though Saudi-backed forces appeared to advance with little resistance.
UAE calls for dialogue
The conflict triggered an immediate diplomatic response. The UAE released a statement saying Yemenis should prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability.

 

Saudi Arabia, in a statement posted by its foreign ministry to social media, called for “a comprehensive conference in Riyadh to bring together all southern factions to discuss just solutions to the southern cause”. Riyadh said the Yemeni government had issued the invitation for talks.
Overnight, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi confirmed he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue.
Tensions boiled over early this week when Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramaut and demanded all remaining UAE forces in Yemen depart, calling the separatist expansion a “red line” for its security.
The STC responded with accusations that “northern Islamist factions” — a reference to the Islah party within the recognised government — had targeted civilians. The group appealed for international intervention against what it described as a “Saudi-backed military escalation”.
In a clear signal of its secessionist intent, the STC announced on Friday the start of a two-year transitional period leading to a referendum on independence for a new “South Arabian state”.
Aidaros Alzubidi, the STC chief, said the process would include dialogue with Yemen’s Houthi-controlled north, but warned the group would declare independence “immediately” if there was no dialogue or if southern Yemen was attacked again.
The political infighting has also disrupted travel. Aden airport, the hub for areas outside Houthi control, has been closed since Thursday amid disputes over flight restrictions. The STC stated on Saturday that southern Yemen was being subjected to a land, sea, and land blockade.
Separately, Pakistan expressed support on Saturday for Yemen’s territorial integrity and the Saudi-led push for de-escalation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday had a phone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan shortly after landing in Beijing, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
In a post on X today, the FO stated that the pair “deliberated on the recent situation in the region” during the phone call.
“The DPM/FM welcomed the Saudi foreign ministry’s statement regarding Yemen and appreciated the efforts of all sides to resolve the regional situation amicably,” the FO stated.







Meanwhile, the FO also welcomed the call by Yemen’s presidential council to hold a dialogue in Riyadh, urging all stakeholders to engage in “good faith” toward a negotiated political solution.
The FO expressed Pakistan’s hope that, guided by the principles of unity and brotherhood, regional efforts will contribute to bringing lasting peace and stability in Yemen.

Speaking in a recorded television appearance marking a holiday, Ayatollah Khamenei addressed the mounting crisis facing Iran’s leadership.
He adopted a dual approach to the demonstrations that have flared across more than two dozen cities since Sunday, acknowledging legitimate economic grievances while drawing a hard line against political dissent.
“We will speak with the protesters, but talking to rioters is useless,” Khamenei said. “Rioters should be put in their place.” Khamenei’s defiance came just one day after Trump warned that the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go” regarding the situation in Iran. Although Trump did not specify what action he might take, the threat adds to the pressure on Tehran following US and Israeli airstrikes last summer targeting Iran’s nuclear sites and military leaders.
‘Bazaaris were right’
Addressing the geopolitical tension, the Iranian leader insisted the country “will not yield to the enemy”. However, he conceded the validity of frustrations expressed by market traders regarding the collapsing rial currency.
“The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions,” Khamenei said. “The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair.”
He noted that the president and high-ranking officials were working to resolve difficulties in the sanctions-battered economy.
As authorities promised dialogue for economic complaints, rights groups reported a sharp rise in violence and arrests. Demonstrators calling for political change have clashed with security forces, resulting in at least 10 deaths.
Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.
Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day.
State television reported additional arrests in western and central Iran, including individuals accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and homemade pistols.
Discontent takes political turn
The unrest began as an expression of discontent over high prices, but quickly expanded to include political demands.
The semi-official Fars news agency reported that crowds in Karaj, on the outskirts of Tehran, burned the Iranian flag and shouted, “Death to the dictator!”
Videos circulated by rights groups showed marchers chanting: “We don’t want spectators: join us.”
State media offered accounts of deadly confrontations in smaller cities. The Mehr news agency reported that Ali Azizi, a member of the paramilitary Basij force, was “martyred after being stabbed and shot” in the western city of Harsin.
The Tasnim news agency reported a man was killed in the holy city of Qom when a grenade he was attempting to use exploded “in his hands”.
Social media posts reported unrest overnight in several districts of the capital, with activists proclaiming “this isn’t the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!”
While reports of violence have centred on Iran’s western provinces, the atmosphere in Tehran appeared quieter on Saturday, a public holiday, as rain and snow kept many streets empty.

Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah observed that the CM had repeatedly ignored summons and remained absent from proceedings without any lawful justification. The court noted that despite being given multiple opportunities to present himself before the court and respond to the allegations, the accused failed to comply with judicial directions.
The court took a serious view of the persistent non-appearance and termed it a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process. Consequently, the judge ordered law enforcement authorities to ensure Mr Afridi’s production before the court. Following the issuance of the arrest warrants, the court adjourned proceedings till January 17.
According to the case record, the matter stems from a complaint registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which has booked the KP chief minister under various provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).

Civil judge describes non-compliance with orders as deliberate attempt to evade legal process

Besides the cybercrime case, Mr Afridi and his colleagues are facing proceedings in an anti-terrorism court for their alleged involvement in the Nov 26 protest in Islamabad.
The anti-terrorism court had initiated proclamation proceedings against them for repeatedly failing to appear before the court. The court had called upon CM Afridi, Meena Khan, Amjad Khan, Shafiullah Jan and Amjad Afridi to appear before it to face ongoing legal proceedings. In its order, the court had noted that the repeated absence of the defendants left it with “no option but to initiate proclamation proceedings,” while granting them a final opportunity to surrender.
The notices had warned that failure to appear during the Section 87 proceedings would compel the court to proceed with further legal action in accordance with the law. The case is based on an FIR registered in connection with a November 26 protest, in which the chief minister and other individuals were nominated.
Mr Afridi is also facing a case in the Election Commission of Pakistan for the code of conduct violation during a recent by-election on a national seat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His lawyers have, however, challenged the ECP’s jurisdiction in the case while also moving the high court against the election watchdog.
The ECP had summoned the CM after he threatened the election staff during a political gathering in Havelian, Abbott­abad, ahead of the by-poll in NA-18.
It may be noted that Mr Afridi has been tasked by party leader Imran Khan, who is in jail, to lead the ‘street movement’ against the government. He visited Lahore last week to galvanise the party’s supporters, but the provincial authorities created hurdles in his political activities, prompting allegations from both sides.
He is set to visit Karachi next week to whip up support for the planned protest drive. The CM had also staged a sit-in outside the Adiala jail after the authorities barred him from visiting Imran Khan. However, he refrained from participating in subsequent protests to avoid legal troubles.

Filed by Advocate Nabeel Javed Kahloon, the petition seeks to set aside the sale of the national carrier, describing it as illegal and unconstitutional.
The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) had endorsed a Rs135 billion bid from an Arif Habib Group-led consortium for a 75 per cent stake in the airline.
The winning bid was approximately 35pc higher than the government’s reference price of Rs115bn. The consortium has pledged to invest an additional Rs80bn to Rs125bn into the airline for fleet modernisation and operational restructuring.
The petitioner argues that the privatisation process, specifically the Expression of Interest (EOI) published on May 7, 2025 and the subsequent sale on Dec 23 violates the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (Conversion) Act, 2016.

Petitioner says Dec 23 move is in violation of law governing the airline

He states that the federal government, while issuing the EOI, did not appreciate the legal fact that PIA is a trans-provincial institution included in the Federal Legislative List, Part II, hence without the approval of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) as mandated under Article 154 of the Constitution, since no privatisation could take place.
He argues that the government, through its cabinet committee, passed an order illegally for the privatisation of PIA without the approval of CCI and Parliament.
He contends that any restructuring or transfer of assets should remain within government-controlled entities as per the sections 3 and 4 of the 2016 Act.
The petitioner claims that massive public funds have been injected into the airline over decades and its sale to a private group is a matter of significant public interest.
He contends that the respondents, to justify privatisation, falsely portrayed PIA as a burden on the public exchequer and wrongly stated that its value is five times less than its accumulated losses (approximately Rs800bn).
In fact, he claims, PIA has not been receiving grants or subsidies from the government as its financial difficulties are due to debt servicing, mismanagement and policy failures.
He argues that the process for the sale of the asset adopted by the respondents amounts to misuse of authority, lack of transparency and arbitrary.
The lawyer argues that an amendment made to Section 28 of the Privatisation Commission Ordinance on Dec 14 2023, to oust jurisdiction of high courts, does not apply to the case in hand, since the petition challenges constitutional and legal violations, not private disputes between bidders.
He asserts that the sale of a national asset like PIA falls under judicial scrutiny under Article 199 of the Constitution.
Advocate Kahloon, who is known for representing aviation industry’s employees before courts, alleges that he has been subjected to harassment for raising the issue of the PIA’s privatisation.
The lawyer asks the court to declare the sale null and void, specifically the agreement reached on Dec 23, 2025.
He also urges the court to suspend all further steps, halt any actions arising from the May 2025 EOI and order that any necessary restructuring be kept strictly within state-owned entities.

While Infinix and Tecno have already announced higher rates, other brands, including Vgotel, Vivo, Realme, Oppo, etc., plan to announce new rates in the coming week.
Manufacturers say this is due to the high cost of chipsets.
“The memory chips have become costlier, between 20 and 30 per cent, and all of it is imported,” said Muzaffar Paracha, Senior Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan Mobile Phone Manufacturers Ass­ociation (PMPMA).

Manufacturers cite higher memory-chip costs,  AI-driven demand and global supply constraints for rising handset prices

Manufacturers noted that the cost of memory chips has increased by $20-30 per set. This is because the world is facing a shortage of memory chips.
“There are only three key producers of mobile phones — Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands that dominate world markets,” said Amir Allawala, a senior member of the association.
He added that, due to new developments, the prices of many items are rising rapidly, such as solar panels, ICs, and chipsets, as the world moves towards 5G-compatible mobile devices.
Apart from Samsung and Apple, almost all mobile phone manufacturers globally have been hit by a severe shortage of memory chips.
Most mobile phone chipsets for motherboards, such as processors and memory chips, are produced in Taiwan. Apple and Samsung phones, however, have their own supply lines for memory chips used in their devices.
Supply of memory chips has been constrained in Taiwan and Japan due to continuously rising demand across all sectors, including non-mobile manufacturers.
“This is because of extensive use of AI in almost all apps, which has led to the use of higher-capacity memory chips,” said Zeeshan Miannoor, vice chairman of the PMPMA.
“Now almost all preloaded apps on phones have AI features, which has led to increased memory requirements for both RAM and ROM,” he added.
Currently, the minimum smartphone memory configuration is 4GB RAM (random access memory) and 64GB ROM (read-only memory).
RAM serves as short-term storage for what the CPU is currently using, while ROM stores permanent startup code and essential data.
Taiwanese memory-chip makers have almost stopped producing 4GB/64GB chips, and prices of 4GB/128GB IC chips have increased significantly due to a shift in production towards 6GB/256GB chips.
“This is because the world is shifting to higher-capacity and 5G-compatible sets,” said Naveed Gaba, CEO of VGOTel.
As manufacturers shift to higher-capacity memory chips, there is a shortage of lower-capacity chips, while newer ones are more expensive.
He added that Chinese companies have started focusing on chip manufacturing, but this will take time.
Meanwhile, a senior expert in the field said recent conflicts in 2025 have highlighted the importance of autonomous weaponry such as missiles and drones. The expert added that high-grade chipsets and memory chips are in demand from sectors beyond IT and telephony.
Mr Allawala added that smartphone prices will rise and that the government needs to devise innovative options.
“There have been talks for some time about smartphones being sold on installments. This would allow consumers to buy phones more easily,” he said, adding that the government must facilitate greater localisation, which would help reduce the cost of other components used in mobile sets.
Around 31 million mobile sets are produced locally, but about 47pc are still 2G feature phones, as 4G and data services are not available in many remote and low-population areas.
After the upcoming spectrum auction, demand for smartphones with higher memory capacity is also expected to increase, as telecom operators roll out 4G services in more underserved areas.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that a snow-clearing operation, led by Captain Asmad Gulfam, took place on the night of December 2 (Friday) and continued into this morning, to facilitate troops moving in the area.
“At around 2am on January 3, 2026, while [the] subject operation was ongoing, a snow slide triggered, resultantly Captain Asmad [28, a resident of Lahore], along with two soldiers and [a] civilian machine operator (PWD), got entrapped,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that four individuals were rescued from the snow; however, the condition of Captain Asmad, Sepoy Rizwan (32, a resident of Attock) and machine operator Essa (a resident of Astore) deteriorated and the three embraced martyrdom.
“These individuals rendered [the] ultimate sacrifice by leading a challenging operation, in extreme weather conditions, to facilitate operational movement of forces,” the ISPR stated.
“Their sacrifice and devotion to duty is [a] testimony to the fact that all ranks of [the] Pakistan Armed Forces are determined to defend the motherland and will not hesitate to lay down their lives in the line of duty and devotion to [the] cause.”
Last month, two army personnel were seriously injured when a speeding oil tanker hit an army vehicle near Qazi Ahmed town along the National Highway in Nawabshah on Saturday.
The victims, identified as Mohammed Bakhsh and Mohammed Nadeem, were on their way to Sukkur from Karachi when their vehicle met with the accident.
Police and Rescue-1122 personnel rushed to the accident site and moved the victims to the Qazi Ahmed Taluka Hospital for emergency treatment. Later, one of them was referred to the People’s Medical University Hospital in Nawabshah, due to his critical condition.</p><small>2026-01-03 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643063-army-officer-soldier-among-three-martyred-in-gb-snow-clearance-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Army officer, soldier among three martyred in GB snow clearance operation</strong></a><br><p>
