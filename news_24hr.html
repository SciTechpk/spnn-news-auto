Speaking at a joint press conference at Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, members of the business community warned that the strike would be changed into a prolonged agitation if the demands were not met.
Chamber president Fazal Moqeem Khan, along with senior vice president Abdul Jalil Jan and members of the SCCI’s executive committee at the Chamber House here, rejected the “alarming” provisions of the Finance Act, which came into force on July 1, 2025, said in the prevailing situation, the business community had been left with no option but to take even more drastic steps, including suspending the filing of sales tax and income tax returns.
He noted that those sentiments were increasingly echoed by SCCI’s members, who had lost faith in the prevailing economic environment due to the government’s oppressive policies.

Business community threatens prolonged agitation if govt doesn’t meet demands

Fazal voiced solidarity with the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which identified 30 “harsh tax and customs measures” as a serious threat to the survival of businesses across the country.
He emphasised that the SCCI stood shoulder to shoulder with all business organisations demanding the immediate reversal of these unjust laws.
The SCCI leader said the introduction of Sections 37A and 37B of the Income Tax Ordinance was a draconian and unprecedented move.
“The Finance Act also has an amendment introduced through Section 21(s), which effectively disallows any cash transaction amounting to Rs200,000 or more for tax deduction purposes. This means that if a customer pays a supplier in cash, even by depositing cash directly into the supplier’s account, the supplier could be penalised by losing 50 per cent of the expense in tax calculations,” he noted.
The SCCI chief voiced serious reservations about the mandatory implementation of e-bilty and digital invoicing systems for all sales tax-registered entities.
He criticised the FBR for attempting to enforce complex digital systems in a country where general and computer literacy remains significantly low.
“Why are taxpayers being forced to perform the FBR’s duties at their own expense? This will only widen the gap between the business community and tax authorities,” he said.
Fazal said businessmen should be encouraged to focus on productivity and revenue generation rather than bureaucratic red tape that stifled operations and increased costs.
The SCCI chief also flayed the government’s complete disregard for the established consultative process traditionally followed before the passage of the Finance Bill.
He said historically, the Business Anomaly Committee engaged with stakeholders and the FBR in a series of meetings to address anomalies and formulate mutually agreed-upon recommendations.
“These discussions are held with the participation of Member Inland Revenue, Member Customs, and eventually the Finance Minister and Chairman FBR.”
The SCCI president said this year, the process was unilaterally bypassed for the first time, leaving no room for dialogue or consensus.
He added that in protest, several committee members resigned and walked out.
“Despite vocal objections from the business community and the parliamentary standing committees, the Finance Bill was rushed through the house,” he said.
Fazal urged the prime minister to immediately withdraw sections 37A and 37B, the Rs200,000 cash transaction penalty under Section 21(s), the digital invoicing requirement under SRO 709, and the mandatory e-bilty provision under Section 40(c).
“Section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, which also grants discretionary powers to the FBR commissioner to disallow complete input tax adjustment, is completely unacceptable,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) on Monday decided to launch an anti-tax movement to unite all political parties of Malakand Division, trader federations, business associations, chambers, lawyers, journalists and people from other walks of life on a single platform to initiate a public movement.
The decision was made during a SCCI meeting held in Swat under the chairmanship of president Noor Mohammad Khan.
The session included a detailed discussion on the imposition of a 10pc sales tax and the resulting public reaction. The participants stressed that while the government was taking steps to restore Fata, the former status of the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas should also be reinstated.
The participants said there was a severe lack of employment opportunities in Malakand Division, while the residents had long suffered due to natural disasters and conflicts.
They added that if the government couldn’t provide employment to youth, it must not impose taxes.
The participants also complained about the demolition of public property in the recent anti-encroachment operations and said the administration used the crackdown to cover up their inefficiency and negligence. They demanded immediate relief for the affected individuals.
The participants formed a committee to consider selling the land previously purchased for the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and acquiring more suitable land.

According to district police officials, the crossfire erupted after militants launched a sudden attack on an FC checkpost and a nearby police station using heavy weaponry. During the assault, a mortar shell landed inside the Azam Warsak police station, causing partial damage to the building.
DSP Wana Imranullah confirmed the incident, saying that the attackers, whose identity and affiliation remain unknown, opened fire from an undisclosed location. In response, FC and police personnel retaliated, and the firefight continued for an extended period. The assailants, however, managed to flee under the cover of darkness.
DSP Imranullah further said that one of the mortar shells struck a residential house nearby, leaving three civilians injured.
All three injured were rushed to District Headquarters Hospital, Wana, for immediate medical attention.
According to medical superintendent Dr Jan Mohammad, two of the critically wounded were later referred to Dera Ismail Khan via Rescue 1122 ambulance service, while the third victim is reported to be out of danger.
In the aftermath of the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a search operation in the surrounding areas. Authorities said an investigation has been initiated, and efforts are underway to trace the perpetrators.

The deaths were reported in Bajaur, Khyber, Malakand, Kohat and Lakki Marwat districts. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) confirmed six deaths.
According to it, a boundary wall collapsed in Mamund tehsil of Bajaur, killing a woman. Similarly, two children were washed away in flash floods in Chora area of Jamrud, while a roof collapse incident in Kohat claimed a life.
Two minor girls were killed as a wall collapsed on them in Batkhela area of Malakand region.

Downpour damages roads and bridges; causes power suspension

In Lakki Marwat district, four children drowned in a rainwater pond in the Daulatkhel area of Lakki Marwat district.
A resident said the rural locality received heavy downpour on Sunday night, filling the deep ditch with water.
“The boys, aged between 9-12, got stuck in the deep water while bathing in it. Local divers rushed there and pulled out their bodies,” he said.
A Rescue 1122 official said that divers were sent along with a medical team to the rural area after the control room learned about the incident.
He identified the deceased as Rahimullah, Fahimullah, Fahad and Hamad and said that the bodies were transported to the Government City Hospital.
A hospital official said that the boys had died before reaching the emergency ward. He said that the bodies were handed over to the relatives after fulfilling formalities.
On Sunday night, rain with strong winds lashed urban and rural parts of the district, inundating roads and streets and suspending power supply.
 


The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on the Darra Tang Road.
Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.
Deputy commissioner Zeeshan Abdullah dispatched government officials along with heavy machinery to the site to repair the damaged road and restore traffic movement.
Torrential rains and sudden flash floods late Monday night caused widespread destruction in multiple areas of birmal tehsil, Lower South Waziristan. According to the district administration officials, at least two mud houses were completely destroyed, over 15 rooms collapsed, and fertile agricultural land along with fruit orchards were washed away by the raging floodwaters.
In the Azam Warsak Nargasi area, the house of prominent tribal elder Haji Said Ullah was entirely destroyed in the flood. In the Warai Noor area, the boundary walls and roofs of a house caved in, while a nearby well was also swept away. Fortunately, no casualties were reported, and the family members remained safe.
Strong winds accompanying the rainstorm also blew away solar panels installed on the rooftops of several houses, resulting in disruption of local electricity supply. Life in the affected areas was severely affected, with residents struggling to access food and essential services.
Meanwhile, the Wana–Gomal Zam Road, a vital transport artery connecting South Waziristan Lower with other regions, was once again blocked due to fresh landslides. According to Additional Deputy Commissioner South Waziristan Lower Khalid Qayum, multiple sections of the road, particularly around Sheenikai, have been completely buried under debris, and no clearance operation was initiated. Traffic was diverted to the Wana-Jandola Road, which is also facing congestion and delays.
Met department forecast for Monday night predicted rain showers with thunderstorm and gusty winds is likely at scattered places in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, North and South Waziristan districts.
Heavy rainfall is also expected at isolated places during the period.
Meanwhile, a statement issued here stated that the minister for the local government department put all the relevant agencies on alert during the current spell. It said that following the heavy rains on Sunday in Peshawar and other parts of the province, institutions operating under the LG department took immediate and effective measures, and teams remained active in the field to handle any emergency situation.
According to a Peshawar Development Authority report, at around 4pm, heavy rain and strong winds led to water accumulation on roads in various areas of Hayatabad. However, no drain closure was reported.
All accumulated water was drained within two to three hours after the rain stopped. The areas where water accumulated included Bagh Naran Chowk, PSO Pump Phase III, Phase IV Underpass, Aramco Pump Phase V, Tatara Park Chowk, near Zarghoni Mosque, and some roads in Phase I and Sector D-1.
Mr Khan said the safety and convenience of people during the monsoon was the administration’s top priority. He said all departments should remain alert to deal with any emergency promptly.

The conservative-dominated court, in an unsigned order, lifted a stay that had been placed by a federal district judge on mass layoffs at the department.
The three liberal justices on the nine-member panel dissented.
Trump pledged during his White House campaign to eliminate the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and he moved in March to slash its workforce by nearly half.
Trump instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job”.
 






Around 20 states joined teachers’ unions in challenging the move in court, arguing that the Republican president was violating the principle of separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s prerogatives.
In May, District Judge Myong Joun ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of fired Education Department employees.
The supreme court lifted the judge’s order without explanation, just days after another ruling that cleared the way for Trump to carry out mass firings of federal workers in other government departments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said in the Education ruling that “only Congress has the power to abolish the Department”.
“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naïve, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave,” Sotomayor said.
Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the US, with only about 13 per cent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
 
 

After returning to the White House in January, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — previously headed by Elon Musk — to downsize the government.
Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programmes — targeting diversity initiatives and abolishing the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency USAID and others.</p><small>2025-07-15 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1507520242280c9.jpg?r=075208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924275/ecp-seeks-kp-assembly-session-to-swear-in-mpas-on-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>ECP seeks KP Assembly session to swear in MPAs on reserved seats</strong></a><br><p>• Writes to KP governor, chief minister; says delay in oath taking would prevent it from holding Senate elections on schedule
• Commission reserves verdict on plea seeking redistribution of reserved seats in provincial assembly
ISLAMABAD: With Senate elections in Kh­yber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) just a week away, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has written to the province’s governor and chief minister, asking that the provincial assembly be convened immediately so that new members can be sworn in on reserved seats.
Also on Monday, the ECP reserved its verdict in a case related to reallocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
The letter, addressed to the KP governor’s principal secretary, stated that the commission was obligated to conduct Senate elections in the province, which had been set for July 21.
“But the matter of administration of oath is still pending and dela­yed,” it said.
The correspondence no­ted that the KP Asse­mbly speaker was requ­ested to administer the oath to the newly returned candidates, enabling them to complete the electoral college for Senate elections.
In response, the speaker has conveyed that the oath will be administered when the assembly is in session.
“The Commission has also received a copy of the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, attached with the application submitted by Mr Suresh Kumar MPA and others in this Comm­ission, wherein the Spe­aker has stated that neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Asse­mbly of Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa Proce­dure and Con­duct of Business Rules, 1988, contain any provision empowering the Speaker to summon a session of Assembly on his own,” it said.
Noting that the administration of oaths has already been delayed considerably, it asked the governor to summon the assembly at the earliest.
Through another letter, the KP chief minister has been requested to issue advice to the governor to summon the assembly immediately, so that new members can take oath and the Senate elections can be held.
Verdict reserved
Meanwhile, an ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, reserved its verdict in a case related to the re-allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly, after hearing arguments from all parties.
Five political parties — the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, Awami National Party and PTI-Parliamentarians — and 71 individuals had been issued notices, as the ECP fixed the case for hearing after receiving the order of the Peshawar High Court.
The PHC had on July 8 ordered the ECP to redistribute reserved seats after hearing all parties, while declaring the ECP’s notifications on distribution of reserved seats of KP Assembly null and void. The PHC verdict came on a petition filed by the PML-N.
Later, talking to reporters, JUI-F counsel Senator Kamran Murtaza said the PML-N was demanding a greater share of reserved seats after independent candidate, Tariq Awan, joined the party belatedly.
Mr Murtaza said that an independent lawmaker who joins a political party after the time stipulated in the law has expired, continues to be an independent, and this in no way affects the share of a political party in terms of reserved seats.
The PTI-led government currently holds 92 seats in the KP Assembly, while the opposition, which was only able to win 18 out of the total of 115 general seats, has seen its numbers swell to 53.

Former prime minister Ehud Olmert said in the interview with The Guardian newspaper that if Palestinians are “deported into a new ‘humanitarian city’ (in southern Gaza Strip), then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing”.
Olmert served as Israel’s prime minister from 2006 to 2009.
The proposed city intended to hold hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be a “concentration camp”, Olmert warned.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said last week he had told the military to advance plans for the zone, which would be meant to eventually contain the “entire population” of Gaza. The area would be built on the ruins of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, and once Palestinians enter the zone, they would not be allowed to leave.
The minister vowed to implement a plan for the migration of Palestinians from Gaza.
“It is a concentration camp. I am sorry,” Olmert told The Guardian. “If they (Palestinians) will be deported into the new ‘humanitarian city’, then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing.”
He has repeatedly condemned the behaviour of the Israeli military in Gaza and the country’s political leadership. In May, he said he could no more defend Israel against charges of war crimes. “What is it if not a war crime?” he asked rhetorically in an interview with CNN.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right members of his government are “committing actions which can’t be interpreted any other way”, Ehud Olmert added.
His latest comments go beyond questioning Tel Aviv’s intentions in Gaza, particularly since comparisons to Nazi concentration camps is virtually unimaginable in Israel. Olmert said it was an “inevitable interpretation” of the plans.
“People make their way past the rubble of houses in Rafah in Jan 2025, a day after a now-defunct ceasefire deal in the conflict came into force.
“When they build a camp where they (plan to) ‘clean’ more than half of Gaza, then the inevitable understanding of the strategy is that it is not to save (Palestinians). It is to deport them, to push them and to throw them away,” Olmert told the Guardian.
Israeli cabinet discusses proposal
The Israeli defence minister’s proposal for the “humanitarian city” were debated at a meeting with Netanyahu on Sunday.
Yair Lapid, the head of Israel’s opposition, blasted the plans as an attempt by Netanyahu to let his far-right government partners “run wild with extreme fantasies just to preserve his coalition”.
Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said last week that Katz’s plan would entail the forcible transfer of a population in preparation for deportation. Both of these are war crimes, he observed.
“If they are done on a massive scale — whole communities — they can amount to crimes against humanity,” Sfard added.

As the violence escalated, Israel — which had previously warned that it would intervene in Syria to protect the Druze — said it struck  “several tanks” in Sweida.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a warning to Damascus after the military struck several tanks in southern Syria to prevent  them from reaching a Druze village near the scene of sectarian clashes.
The Israeli strikes were  “a message and a clear warning to the Syrian  regime — we will not allow harm to be done to the Druze in Syria.  Israel will not stand idly by,” he wrote on X.

Israel says strikes a clear warning to Damascus

The fighting underscores the challenges facing interim leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, whose forces ousted president Bashar al-Assad in December, in a country reeling from 14 years of war.
The Syrian military and interior ministries announced troop deployments, safe corridors for civilians and a pledge to end the fighting  “quickly and decisively”.
The violence began when Bedouin gunmen abducted a Druze vegetable vendor on the highway to Damascus, prompting retaliatory kidnappings.
Though hostages were later released, the fighting carried on Monday outside Sweida city, with mortar fire hitting villages and dozens wounded, said the Suwayda 24 news outlet.
The streets of Sweida were deserted, with a photographer reporting gunfire during funerals.
“We lived in a state of extreme terror — the shells were falling randomly,” said Abu Taym, a 51-year-old father in Sweida.
“Traffic on the streets is paralysed, and most shops are closed.” Suwayda 24 reported the arrival of  “dozens of victims” at hospitals as a result of clashes in the province’s western countryside and shelling of villages.
The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources on the ground, raised its death toll to 89, including 46 Druze, four civilians, 18 Bedouin fighters and seven unidentified people in military uniforms. A defence ministry source told Al-Ekhbariya state television six security forces personnel were killed  “during disengagement operations in Sweida”.
A correspondent on the outskirts of Sweida city saw vehicles carrying fighters, large interior ministry military convoys, civilian vehicles and motorcycles carrying armed men towards the front lines, as well as ambulances transporting the wounded to hospitals in Damascus.
While Druze spiritual leaders called for calm and urged Damascus to intervene.
Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, one of the three Druze spiritual leaders in Sweida, expressed his  “rejection of the entry” of general security forces into the province, demanding  “international protection”.
Lack of state institutions’
In a Sunday post on X, Interior Minister Anas Khattab said:  “The lack of state, military and security institutions is a major reason for the ongoing tensions in Sweida,  “The only solution is to reactivate these institutions to ensure civil peace,” he added.
The latest bloodshed follows deadly violence in April and May, when clashes between Druze fighters and security forces in Druze-populated areas near Damascus and Sweida killed more than 100 people.

• Extreme rainfall will become ‘more common and stronger’ by end of the century
ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 floods “a forewarning of elevated future flood risks”, a study published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro­aching on floodplains.
Published in Nature, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.
 
 

The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km², causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.
“A significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,” it added.
According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951–2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.
“Monsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,” it said, adding that August 2022’s streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.
It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to “between 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average”.
 
 

Anthropogenic changes
According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.
“The river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994–2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.”
The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.
For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km² to 47,500km² between 2001 and 2022.
Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.
‘Adding fuel to fire’
According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could “increase dramatically” under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become “more common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc”.
“For example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,” they told Dawn via email.
They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.
“Pakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,” they said.
“To reduce the rainfall-induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,” the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.

Muhammad Umar filed the petition for the recovery of his father, Muhammad Sajid.
Representing the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.

“At 02:20 an explosive-laden drone was downed near Arbil International Airport, without causing casualties or damage,” said the counterterrorism services of the Kurdistan region.
There has been no claim of responsibility for the drone, the second intercepted near the airport this month.
Arbil airport, which includes a base for the US-led international anti-terrorist coalition, was frequently targeted by rocket and drone attacks in previous years.
On July 3, authorities said a drone was downed near the airport, with the regional interior ministry blaming the Popular Mobilisation Forces for the attack.
The PMF — Hashed al-Shaabi in Arabic — is a coalition of pro-Iran former paramilitary forces now integrated into the regular forces.

According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.
Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre hike on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.

Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre

In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.
Oil falls 1pc
According to a Reuters report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump’s tariffs.
Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.
Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.
Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.
“The market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.

The fresh Intra-Court Appeals (ICA) were filed on Monday by the Karachi Bar Association (KBA), PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen and Raja Muqsid Nawaz Khan.
Last week, the Lahore High Court Bar Asso­­ciation and Lahore Bar Association challenged the decision.
Five IHC judges — who filed the original petition in the Supreme Court against the transfers — have also challenged the decision.
The petitions filed by KBA and PTI leaders have urged the court to set aside the June 19 judgment, which declared, by a majority of three to two, that the transfer of judges from three different high courts to IHC was in line with the Constitution.

Challenges filed by Karachi Bar Association, PTI’s Shoaib Shaheen and a lawyer

The KBA petition, filed on behalf of Advocate Faisal Siddiqi, pleaded the Constitutional Bench, in its judgment, had failed to provide findings on the question whether the transferred judges could have performed their functions in the IHC without taking a fresh oath.
If the Supreme Court had adjudicated this question and found that such an oath was necessary, then the acting chief justice could not have continued to perform his functions in the high court, the petition argued.
This is a glaring defect in the June 19 verdict, the petition contended, adding that without addressing this point, the judgment erroneously permitted the acting chief justice to carry out his duties. Therefore, the June 19 decision was contrary to the Constitution, without jurisdiction and liable to be set aside.
The petition pleaded the question of oath was not only central for determining seniority at a particular high court, but also strongly tethered to the notion of federalism.
It said that a judge takes an oath to serve at a particular provincial high court. Similarly, for serving at the IHC, a distinct federal territory, an oath is required to be made before the chief justice of IHC.
The CB order in which directed the president to determine the terms of transfer and seniority, has not taken into account that in the summary moved by the Law Ministry on Feb 1 for the transfer of judges, it was already mentioned that “seniority of the transferred judges will be reckoned from the day they entered upon the office of the judge in their respective high courts”.
The president approved this summary which means that this was “capitulation of CB” to the executive for determining the terms of transfer and the question of seniority, it is capitulation with the additional caveat that the president who has already sanctioned the transfers on a particular basis is expected to do something else the second time, the appeal said.
‘Rewriting Constitution’
Likewise, the petition filed by Mr Nawaz on behalf of Advocate Idrees Ashraf argued that Article 200 of the Constitution neither conferred nor implied any independent discretion upon the president to initiate or finalise judicial transfers.
The president, being a ceremonial head, acts on the advice of the executive, it pleaded.
The petition added the CB “erred in remanding the matter” to determine whether the transfer was ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’. “This is a judicial question, and delegating it to the president undermines judicial autonomy and violates the principle of separation of powers.”
The appeal pleaded that interpreting transfers as “permanent” required importing words into the constitutional text, which amounted to judicial overreach and rewriting the Constitution — an act impermissible in constitutional interpretation.
Unlike India, where Article 217 explicitly creates a vacancy upon transfer of a judge, no such vacancy arises in Pakistan.
Therefore, the judge retains affiliation with the parent high court and their original seniority, the appeal contended.
Article 175-A governs judicial appointments and does not overlap with Article 200. Interpreting Article 200 to allow filling vacancies by transfers renders Article 175-A redundant and causes constitutional disharmony, the petition said.

The incident triggered a wave of grief and outrage across the area. Local people say the law and order situation in North Waziristan is deteriorating rapidly.

• Israeli strikes kill another 22 Palestinians in besieged enclave
GAZA CITY: Stuttering Gaza ceasefire talks entered a second week on Monday, with meditators seeking to close the gap between Israel and Hamas, as more than 20 people were killed across the Palestinian territory.
The indirect negotiations in Qatar appear deadlocked after both sides blamed the other for blocking a deal for the release of prisoners and a 60-day ceasefire after 21 months of fighting.
An official with knowledge of the talks said they were “ongoing” in Doha on Monday, telling AFP: “Discussions are currently focused on the proposed maps for the deployment of Israeli forces within Gaza.”
“Mediators are actively exploring innovative mechanisms to bridge the remaining gaps and maintain momentum in the negotiations,” the source added on condition of anonymity.
Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who wants to see the Palestinian group destroyed as a fighting force — of being the main obstacle.
“Netanyahu is skilled at sabotaging one round of negotiations after another, and is unwilling to reach any agreement,” the group wrote on Telegram.
In Gaza, the civil defence agency said at least 22 people were killed on Monday in the latest Israeli strikes in and around Gaza City and in Khan Yunis in the south.
The Al-Quds Brigades — the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, which has fought alongside Hamas — released footage on Monday that it said showed its fighters firing missiles at an Israeli army command and control centre near Shujaiya.
Talks ‘ongoing’
US President Donald Trump said he was still hopeful of securing a truce deal, telling reporters on Sunday night: “We are talking and hopefully we’re going to get that straightened out over the next week.”
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, and the leadership of Hamas and Islamic Jihad held a “consultative meeting” in Doha on Sunday evening to “coordinate visions and positions”, a Palestinian source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
“Egyptian, Qatari and American mediators continue their efforts that make Israel present a modified withdrawal map that would be acceptable,” they added.
On Saturday, the same source said Hamas rejected Israeli proposals to keep troops in more than 40 per cent of Gaza, as well as plans to move Palestinians into an enclave on the border with Egypt.
A senior Israeli political official countered by accusing Hamas of inflexibility and trying to deliberately scupper the talks by “clinging to positions that prevent the mediators from advancing an agreement”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Palestinian minister of state for foreign affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shahin headed to Brussels on Monday for talks between the EU and its Mediterranean neighbours.
But the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority denied media reports that any meeting between the two was on the agenda.
Netanyahu has said he would be ready to enter talks for a more lasting ceasefire once a deal for a temporary truce is agreed, but only when Hamas lays down its arms. He is under pressure to quickly wrap up the war, with military casualties rising and with public frustration mounting at both the continued captivity of the prisoners and a perceived lack of progress in the conflict.
Politically, his fragile governing coalition is holding, for now, but Netanyahu is seen as beholden to a minority of far-right ministers in prolonging an increasingly unpopular conflict.
He also faces a backlash over the feasibility, cost and ethics of a plan to build a so-called “humanitarian city” from scratch in southern Gaza to house Palestinians if and when a ceasefire takes hold.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has described the proposed facility as a “concentration camp” and Israel’s security establishment is reported to be unhappy at the plan.
Israel’s military reprisals since October 2023 have killed 58,386 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Gaza.

“The legitimacy of a tax system in large depends on whether taxpayers are able to understand not only that they are liable, but also the consequences for not discharging their liability,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik while deciding an appeal by the Islamabad Inland Revenue (Legal) commissioner against Pakistan LNG Limited and Serene Air (Pvt) Limited.
Justice Malik was member of a three-judge bench consisting of Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Shahid Waheed, which had taken up for hearing petitions against the April 16, 2024, and June 24, 2024, orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The respondent, Pakistan LNG Limited, whose income tax return for the year 2020 was amended in terms of order March 15, 2021 under Section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, raising a demand of Rs2.9 billion for the recovery of tax dues.

Notes authorities’ conduct in the case ‘falls short of the statutory requirement’; judge says tax recovery not a ‘grab and go’ process

On the same date, a notice under Section 137(2) of the ordinance was issued to the taxpayer. The respondent challenged the amended assessment order before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) (CIR Appeals), which was decided on March 9, 2022, and subsequently uploaded on the web portal of the FBR (i.e., IRIS) at 3:28pm.
On the same date, a notice under Section 140 of the ordinance was issued for the immediate recovery in terms thereof. The notice under Section 140 was subsequently quashed by the high court as void and the amount recovered from the bank accounts of the respondent was ordered to be reimbursed.
Likewise, in the case of Serene Air Private Limited for the tax year 2020 proceedings in terms of Section 161 read with Section 205 of the ordinance were decided on March 31, 2022. On the same date, notices under Section 137(2) of the ordinance were issued, raising a demand of Rs1.8 billion for the recovery of withholding tax.
The respondent filed an appeal, which was decided on May 11, 2023. On the same date, notices under Section 140 of the ordinance were issued to the banks for immediate recovery. These too were set aside by the single judge and the amount recovered was ordered to be reimbursed to the respondent.
Both respondents challenged the recovery notices issued under Section 140 of the ordinance, in constitutional petitions before the high court, which were set aside. The Division Bench upheld the decision of the single bench.
In her judgement, Justice Ayesha held that Section 140 does not permit immediate coercive recovery in the absence of a date set in the notice. Section 140 expressly provides that the party holding money on behalf of the taxpayer must be afforded a notice with a due date to discharge its liability.
The notices issued in both petitions blatantly violated the requirements of the law. Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that no case for interference was made out and therefore the appeals were dismissed.
Justice Ayesha Malik observed that the conduct of the commissioner in the present case fell short of the statutory requirement of Section 140, adding that the tax recovery was not meant to be a ‘grab and go’ process. Even coercive recovery measures must follow a proper and fair procedure, she added. Legal certainty requires not just that taxpayers know they owe tax, but that they are clearly informed of when, how, and on what basis recovery will be pursued.

• CM Gandapur terms threat to arrest Imran’s sons ‘petty’
PESHAWAR: A day after the PTI leadership extended their ‘final’ protest for 90 days, the government and the opposition leaders continued to spar on the purported protest plan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur calling the restrictions ‘regrettable’ and Prime Minister’s Political Affairs Adviser Rana Sanaullah dubbing the party a ‘destabilising’ factor for its repeated protests.
The PTI had planned a nationwide protest, which was expected to reach its peak on Aug 5, but the KP chief minister extended the final push for three months — a move that garnered criticism from his colleagues who complained they were blindsided by the CM.
On Monday, the KP CM, however, took the government to task for its crackdown on party workers, restrictions on its right to protest, as well as an alleged plan to arrest the sons of Imran Khan if they arrived in Pakistan to join the protest movement.
He said restrictions on the right to protest were regrettable and the arrests of the party workers and leadership were also unacceptable. He also called out the government for its statement regarding the arrest of Imran Khan’s sons upon their arrival in Pakistan to take part in the protest for the release of their father, saying such threats were petty.
“Imran Khan’s sons will come to Pakistan. Those who are saying that they will be arrested are showing their meanness,” CM Gandapur said, adding that Imran Khan was in prison for the last two years, so it was the right of his sons to meet him. “No FIR has been registered against the sons of Imran Khan, nor have they committed any crime, then how could they be arrested,” he asked. The CM claimed that the government for the sake of political revenge was damaging Pakistan’s reputation globally by announcing its purported plan to arrest the ex-PM’s sons.
 
 

In a comment on the crackdown on the party supporters, CM Gandapur referred to the November 26 violence in which several PTI workers were reportedly killed. “I believe that if someone is coming to shoot me, I will also respond in the same manner. This is not my party’s policy rather it’s my personal statement and it is allowed by our religion and constitution,” he warned.
Amid conflicting reports regarding the fate of the Aug 5 protest and dissent from within the party, the PTI leader insisted that there should be no grouping in the party as he always believed in unity and was never involved in the grouping or leg-pulling inside the party.
Regarding the rumours of a no-confidence motion in the KP Assembly against him, he challenged all political parties and the state institutions that he would quit politics forever if his government was toppled. He also said that all decisions related to the KP Senate elections would be made by Imran Khan, adding that the party leadership should be allowed to meet the incarcerated party founder.
‘Destabilising the country’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sana­ullah said that the former ruling party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”, Dawn.com reported.
In reference to the Sunday presser, Mr Sanaullah said that CM Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq“ (the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.
“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.
Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, he said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”
He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offices against their granting of an emergency loan to Pakistan.
He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”
He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.
According to Mr Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.
“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”
Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”
“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”

Constance Marten, 38, and Mark Gordon, 51, were arrested after a seven-week police hunt in January and February 2023 during which they spent time living in a tent.
The pair were convicted at London’s Old Bailey court where they had faced a retrial after another jury last year failed to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge.
Marten and Gordon, who had denied all the charges against them, went on the run after police found a placenta in their burnt-out car by a motorway outside Manchester in northwest England.
Marten had told the court they absconded because they wanted to keep their daughter Victoria, after their other four children were taken into care. The couple were eventually arrested nearly two months later, in Brighton on England’s southern coast.

The vast majority of people who died were over 65 and more than half were women, the data it cited showed. The most affected regions were Galicia, La Rioja, Asturias and Cantabria — all located in the northern half of the country, where traditionally cooler summer temperatures have seen a significant rise in recent years.
Like other countries in Western Europe, Spain has been hit by extreme heat in recent weeks, with temperatures often topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 1,180 people who died of heat-related causes between May 16 and July 13 compared with 114 in the same period in 2024, the ministry said in a statement citing data from the Carlos III Health Institute. The number of deaths increased significantly in the first week in July.
The data shows an event  “of exceptional intensity, characterized by an unprecedented increase in average temperatures and a significant increase in mortality attributable to heatwaves”, the ministry said. In the period the data covers, there were 76 red alerts for extreme heat, compared with none a year earlier.
Last summer, 2,191 deaths were attributed to heat-related causes in Spain, according to data from the Carlos III Health Institute. The data from Spain follows a rapid scientific analysis published on July 9 that said around 2,300 people died of heat-related causes across 12 European cities during a severe heatwave in the 10 days to July 2.
It was not immediately clear whether the study conducted by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was using the same methodology as the Spanish data.
UK weather records
Extremes  in temperature and rainfall in the UK are becoming increasingly  frequent, the nation’s meteorological service said on Monday in a report on  Britain’s changing climate. England and Wales endured the wettest  winter in 250 years in from from October 2023 to March 2024, with six  of the 10 wettest winters occurring in the 21st century. The  report also found that last year was the UK’s fourth warmest since 1884  with the last three years all in the top five warmest on record.
Records  were now being broken  “very frequently”, said Mike Kendon, Met Office  climate scientist and lead author of the Met Office’s State of the UK  Climate report.
“It’s the extremes of temperature and rainfall  that is changing the most, and that’s of profound concern, and that’s  going to continue in the future,” he said.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the findings showed Britain’s way of life was  “under threat”. “Whether  it is extreme heat, droughts, flooding, we can see it actually with our  own eyes, that it’s already happening, and we need to act,” he said.
In 2024, experts recorded the warmest spring, the second warmest February and the fifth warmest winter on record. Rising  sea levels surrounding the UK were speeding up, with two-thirds of the  rise recorded since 1900 taking place in the last 30 years, the report  said.

In Naseerabad’s Ghafoorabad and Tamboo areas, heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds caused multiple mud houses to collapse. 
The boundary wall of a school in Ghafoorabad was damaged along with numerous solar panels installed in the area. Though the downpour brought some relief from the intense summer heat, the destruction left many residents struggling with damaged property and limited access to basic facilities.
Officials from the local administration confirmed that loss assessment and emergency relief efforts have begun in the affected areas.
Teams have been dispatched to survey the damage and provide immediate assistance to affected families.

Widespread destruction in Naseerabad, Dhadar, Sohbatpur; dozens of mud houses collapse

In nearby Dhadar, intermittent rain continued throughout the day, raising concerns about rising water levels. According to the Irrigation Department, a flood wave of 6,000 cusecs is currently flowing through the Nari River, while another surge of 4,850 cusecs is passing through the Mushkaf Weir, increasing the risk of flash floods in vulnerable regions.
Sohbatpur faced some of the most severe impacts, with torrential rain and storm winds flooding low-lying neighborhoods and causing local streams and drains to overflow. 
Although the weather improved after the rain, the city’s communication and power infrastructure was severely disrupted. Multiple electrical feeders tripped, mobile networks went offline, and the Sohbatpur grid station sustained critical damage. According to Quetta Electric Supply Company, a high transmission line tower collapsed and the grid station’s boundary wall was also brought down by the storm.
Despite improving weather conditions, affected communities in all three districts — Naseerabad, Dhadar, and Sohbatpur — continue to face difficulties. Authorities have launched restoration and relief efforts, though challenges remain as the full scale of the damage is yet to be determined.

“We are creating job opportunities not only through RDMC but also through our large network of partner and supplier companies that are coming onboard to support this major development,” Mr Bristow said during his visit to Humai village, the closest community to the Reko Diq project site. 
“[W]e have launched educational and skills training programmes. Currently, 75 per cent of our workforce is from Balochistan — the majority from Chagai district — and we aim to continue strengthening this local representation,” he added. 
In addition to economic and educational initiatives, RDMC has invested in health services for the region. A health clinic and newly established Mother & Child Health Centre in Humai are delivering quality primary healthcare to villagers — marking the first time communities in the region have had access to a specialised maternal facility offering comprehensive pre- and postnatal care for women.

• Asks why state institutions have failed to ensure peace in KP
CHARSADDA: Expressing his reluctance to join any attempt to bring about a regime change in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Monday that a no-trust vote may not be possible, given how the fragmented nature of the opposition in the provincial assembly.
“The opposition is busy trying to disqualify one another in courts. Even the PML-N has taken us to court,” the JUI-F chief mused during a visit to Charsadda.
He was talking to reporters during a visit to the area where he inquired after the health of party’s district emir and former legislator Maulana Gohar Shah.
“They should reflect on who is benefitting from their actions. One must think a hundred times before aligning with such an opposition,” he said.
The JUI-F chief also downplayed the possibility of bringing a no-confidence motion against the incumbent PTI-led government in the province — something that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi has hinted at in recent days.
The governor had recently called on the Maulana alongside a PPP delegation — ostensibly to invite him to join efforts to de-seat the PTI-led government in the province — but the JUI-F chief reportedly did not commit to anything.
“It’s difficult to implement any major political strategy with a divided opposition. Who is even ready for a no-confidence motion? The opposition itself is in disarray,” the Maulana said on Monday.
Turning his attention to the PTI, he reiterated his remarks from a few days ago, saying: “In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there is a need for change, but that change should come from within the PTI”.
“Those in power in KP today use vulgar language,” he noted, adding that despite their differences with the PTI, he would not stoop to respond to the harsh and insolent barbs levelled by his political rivals.
The Maulana said that maintaining composure and a respectful environment was one of his objectives, no matter how many differences he had with political opponents.
Blaming the government and state institutions for the unrest prevailing in tribal areas of KP, the JUI-F chief said: “If they can defeat India in a matter of unrest going on for the past 40 years.”
He accused the government and institutions of blaming the public for their own failures. He said the people of Swat and Waziristan were still refugees in their own homeland.
“The establishment is primarily responsible for the prevailing unrest, not the people. It’s unfortunate that instead of introspection, the blame is placed on the public. Declaring the public as a threat or a ‘shelter’ for unrest is not just misleading but unjust.”
“People of Waziristan are once again being asked to leave their homes, why? Don’t burden us with your failures. Look in the mirror,” he remarked.
 
 

He also called for sincere diplomatic engagement with Afghanistan. “We usually act first and then talk, but the real solution lies in negotiation. All issues can be resolved through dialogue. Pakistan must adopt a path of serious negotiations to improve relations with Afghanistan.”
 
 

The JUI-F chief also offered condolences to the family of the late Maulana Muhammad Tayyab, the party’s patron-in-chief in Charsadda.

The initiative, launched under the auspices of the Law and Justice Commi­ssion of Pakistan (LJCP), will be implemented acr­oss all levels of the judiciary, from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court.
The counsels in such cases would be given up to Rs50,000 in remuneration, which would be provided to them through the Dis­trict Legal Empo­werment Commi­ttees, to ensure equi­table access to justice for all citizens.
The decision was taken during a meeting presided over by the chief justice at the Supreme Court Branch Registry in Quetta. The meeting reviewed institutional linkages between the bar associations of Balo­c­histan and LJCP in strengthening justice delivery.
During the meeting, the CJP shared insights from his visits to some remote districts, where he noticed a gap in coordination bet­ween bar associations and the LJCP. He said that despite the availability of funds, they were not being properly utilised for uplifting the district judiciary.
As the commission has limited outreach capacity, LJCP  has decided to post a senior-level representative in every province who will be stationed at the respective high courts. These representatives will act as front desk to maintain liaison with district bar associations, identify local priority areas, raise awareness, and supervise grassroots-level justice sector initiatives.
 
 

The bars associations may present their development project proposals to District  Development Committees. Moreover, representatives of federal and provincial development departments have also been taken on board to ensure speedy execution and to avoid resource duplication.
Moreover, CJP encouraged the bar representatives to ensure that their members benefit from the Continuing Legal Education programmes offered by the Federal Judicial Academy.
Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Attaullah Khan Langov apprised the meeting about various facilities provided by the provincial government to the bar associations across the province.
It included 100 scooties for women lawyers, digital library at High Court Bar, shuttle services from high court to District Court Quetta, a 100-acre housing scheme for lawyers of high court and grant-in-aid by the federal government to 28 districts bars of Balochistan and the High Court Bar Association.
All federal and provincial stakeholders present at the meeting assured their full cooperation and support in advancing the shared goal of accessible and efficient justice.

Data from the national disaster agency between June 26 and July 14 showed that electrocution was the leading cause of fatalities, followed by flash floods.
In late June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
In its latest report, the disaster agency said 111 people, including 53 children, have been killed, with the highest number of deaths in the most populous province of Punjab.
Meanwhile, the national meteorological service has issued a warning for further heavy rainfall in the northern and eastern regions of the country, with the potential for urban flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage due to strong winds.
 
 

Monsoon season brings South Asia 70 to 80 per cent of its annual rainfall, arriving in early June in India and late June in Pakistan, and lasting through until September.
The annual rains are vital for agriculture and food security, and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting the highly complex monsoon.
Pakistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change, and its 240 million residents are facing extreme weather events with increasing frequency.
In 2022, unprecedented monsoon floods submerged a third of Pakistan and killed 1,700 people, with some areas yet to recover from the damage. In May, at least 32 people were killed in severe storms, including strong hailstorms.

• New system will automatically pull data linked to filer’s CNIC, at-source deductions, bank details
• PM seeks early release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals; wants Raast chairman, board to be appointed by September
ISLAMABAD: In a move to simplify tax filing procedures for the salaried class, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has introduced a new interactive return form, which will incorporate an auto-fill system that seamlessly integrates data about purchases, asset details and tax deductions at source etc. — ultimately generating a single-form return upon completion.
The new return form is currently available in English, while the Urdu version is set to come out by the end of this month.
During the first rollout phase, the form will also be available in two regional languages, Sindhi and Pashto. More versions in regional languages — Punjabi and Balochi — are expected to be rolled out subsequently.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, individual taxpayers are required to file their returns by September 30.
The new return form consists of eight digital windows, each containing one input column. The process is designed to be step-by-step, with each screen containing a single question prompt to guide users through the filing process.
In the first window, entering one’s employer’s name will automatically populate the fields of tax deduction at source.
All deductions of withholding taxes based on the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers will also appear on the form.
Similarly, providing bank account details will prompt the form to display closing balances.
Registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will also appear automatically, streamlining data entry and minimising manual input.
 
 

According to an official annou­ncement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR to launch a digital invoicing in Urdu. He said tax reforms should focus on facilitating citizens.
He asked the FBR to expedite the release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals of those amounting to less than Rs50,000. These refunds are to be issued within one month of return submission. The total disbursement under this directive is estimated at Rs10 billion.
While chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms on Monday, the PM instructed the FBR to establish a helpline aimed at assisting the filing process. The meeting was informed that simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals would be available from Tuesday, with access for other taxpayers beginning by July 30.
PM Shehbaz said tax returns had been made digital, concise, and linked with a central database for public convenience. He believed the salaried class would benefit the most from the new simplified tax returns system. He noted that implementation of AI-based tax assessment system was a major success, calling for raising awareness to encourage taxpayers to use the new system.
 
 

He also emphasized a third-party validation to ensure transparency in all FBR reforms. The premier directed the officials concerned to provide special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system.
The meeting was briefed on progress regarding digital invoicing, e-Bilty, simplified tax returns, the AI-based assessment system, the central command and control centre, and the cargo-tracking system. It was shared that FBR’s Command and Control Unit would become operational by September, enabling centralized data access and facilitating efficient decision-making.
Regarding the digital invoicing system, it was noted that all small and large businesses would issue receipts through FBR’s online platform at the point of sale and purchase. Approximately 20,000 businesses are expected to be integrated into the system in the coming months.
Customs automation
The meeting was briefed on the AI-driven assessment system that would allow traders to submit advance goods declarations prior to the arrival of ships, with full exemption from upfront duties and taxes. This measure is expected to increase advance declarations from three per cent to over 95pc, allowing containers to be transported directly from ships to factories.
The meeting was informed that within just one month, 8,000 invoices worth Rs11.6bn were issued. The system includes a taxpayer portal and a monitoring dashboard. Integration with PRAL is free of cost, and traders’ training is being actively facilitated. Once fully implemented, traders will no longer need to file separate sales tax returns, as transactions would be automatically recorded in the system.
Digital economy
The PM said the digitisation of the economy was the government’s top priority as it would bring transparency to the system. He said that digitalising payment systems between the public and the government would enhance transparency and ease of use for citizens.
 
 

He directed that progress towards a digital economy be accelerated and instructed that the processes of digitisation and the shift towards a cashless economy be simplified for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasised that all state-owned enterprises should be integrated into the digital framework.
The PM advised the relevant officials to complete the process for the appointments of the board of governors and chairman of Raast by September. He noted that RAAST’s Board of Directors must comprise business experts.
The meeting was informed that the number of users of mobile apps and digital banking services was expected to increase from 95 million to 120m, with the volume of digital payments projected to rise from Rs7.5bn to Rs15bn. A nationwide public awareness campaign on Raast and digital payments would be launched next month.
To align Pakistan’s economy with those of developed nations, a Digital Payments Index will be introduced within one month. Additionally, the Capital Development Authority Board has approved the right of way for digital public infrastructure in Islamabad.
It was also noted that the remittance system was being digitised, ensuring that all funds sent from abroad would be received through the formal banking system. Coordination is ongoing with the governments of all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to promote digital payments.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
Market Police Station House Officer Munir Abbasi told Dawn.com, “A person from Moro died and three others were injured when the roof of a shop collapsed in the Timber Market area.”
A dust storm preceded rain in the city, Latifabad and Qasimabad. The Met Office recorded the speed of rainfall at 42 nautical miles per hour with 94 millimetres of rainfall in the city, while 56mm was recorded in Latifabad. However, the waterlogging situation remained equally bad in both areas, regardless of the different volumes of rainfall being recorded.
The inundation of major roads was worsened for the Hyderabad Water and Sewerage Corporation (HW&SC) due to a massive power breakdown.
Rainfall began at around 4:20pm and continued till 6pm with moderate to high speed. People were seen wading through knee-deep rainwater on roads and streets in different areas while civic and district administration officials seemed to be struggling to cope with the situation.
District administration and civic bodies representatives were visiting various pumping stations to deal with the situation and ensure drainage of rainwater from the rain-affected areas, including the market’s roads and localities.
Met Office spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said that the rain was torrential in nature. There is a forecast of rain across Sindh for the next couple of days as well.
Accumulation of rainwater led to traffic gridlock on main roads, including the Hyderabad-Latifabad flyover, and the underpass connecting the city with Latifabad remained completely closed due to stagnant rainwater there.
Shah Makki Road remained flooded as well. Thus, most vehicular traffic was seen on the Latifabad flyover. A long queue of vehicles could be seen up to Cantonment graveyard road.
The city remained without power as the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) reported damage to its infrastructure. According to a statement from Hesco’s spokesman, four grid stations of the 132kV transmission system of the power utility were badly hit as towers connected with them fell due to rainfall.
It said the grid stations were connected with a 220kV circuit and that out of 152 feeders, only 12 were unaffected by the rain, while the remaining 140 tripped. The spokesman said that 54 were later re-energised, and staff were inspecting others to bring them online again.
A huge tree fell on the transmission line at Fatima Jinnah Road, affecting the power supply. Major pumping stations of HW&SC, including Tulsi Das, which were dependent on Hesco’s system, lost power.
Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro blamed Hesco’s power failure for the delay in the drainage of rainwater, adding that only 30 per cent of sewerage facilities were now energised, but 70pc remained offline.
“I hope all entire rainwater will be drained out by tonight,” he said. He added that some pumping stations had received electricity, but faults were again reported, due to which they were shut down for repair. He said that Tulsi Das, Aga Khan, Poly and LD1 pumping stations were major facilities that deal with the drainage of rainwater.
Sindh CM takes immediate action on flooding
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah closely monitored the situation in Hyderabad following heavy rains that caused flooding in several areas, according to a press release from the CM’s Office.
He contacted the mayor to receive a detailed briefing on drainage efforts and directed urgent measures to expedite water removal. Due to power outages caused by Hesco feeder trips, pumping stations were temporarily shut down, hindering drainage operations.
The chief minister instructed Energy Minister Nasir Shah to coordinate with Hesco to restore electricity to the pumping stations immediately.
CM Murad emphasised the importance of restoring all major roads to ease public difficulties and called for all relevant departments, including district administrations, municipal bodies, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, traffic police and rescue services, to work in close coordination.
He stressed that public safety remained the government’s top priority and warned that any negligence would not be tolerated.
Additional precautionary steps were ordered, including keeping dewatering pumps and staff on alert in low-lying areas, placing warning boards near electrical hazards, maintaining 24-hour control rooms and ensuring timely public information through media channels.
The chief minister also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the rains and cooperate with authorities to mitigate risks.
“Sindh’s government continues to take all possible measures to minimise disruption caused by the monsoon rains and safeguard the lives and property of its residents,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-07-14 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614007-karachi-police-drop-case-against-salman-farooqui-in-youth-assault-incident' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police drop case against Salman Farooqui in youth assault incident</strong></a><br><p>

According to its website, the bipartisan commission was established in 2008 and is charged with promoting, defending and advocating for international human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.
The commission’s hearing notice states that the session will take place on Tuesday (tomorrow) at 3:30pm (12:30am PKT on Wednesday) and will “examine the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists, and its actions to control media communications and prevent free and fair elections in Pakistan”. The session is open to the public and the media.
“Many date the current phase of repression in Pakistan to 2022, when, with the involvement of the Pakistan military, popular Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and soon after, arrested, convicted of corruption and imprisoned,” the notice read.
“Parliamentary elections in February 2024 were, according to the US State Department, marked by ‘undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly’, as well as ‘electoral violence, and restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms’,” it added.
 






The commission provided a list of witnesses who would provide testimony during Tuesday’s hearing. Besides Bukhari, the list includes Amnesty International’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; Perseus Strategies Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini.
A press release from the commission’s co-chairman, Republican Congressman Christopher Smith, who will chair the session, said the meeting would “discuss the government of Pakistan’s ongoing political repression, the US response, and offer recommendations for Congress”.
Bukhari announced that he would be testifying before the commission in a post on X dated July 9, expressing gratitude to the commission’s co-chairs, Democratic Congressman James McGovern and Smith, for the opportunity to testify.
“I will be highlighting the arbitrary detention of Imran Khan, his wife, and other political prisoners, as well as the erosion of democracy, the undermining of the rule of law, and escalating crackdowns on freedom of expression in Pakistan,” he wrote.
Genser replied to Bukhari’s post, writing, “I am honoured and grateful to be able to testify alongside you before the [Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission] on Pakistan, human rights and the situation of Imran Khan and all political prisoners being held by the current regime.”
 






Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is standing at a crossroads amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners.
Titled ‘Free speech and public interest journalism under siege’, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has also expressed deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.
