<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6861d7e3e4bde.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921147/man-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>‘Man of peace’?</strong></a><br><p>PRESIDENT Donald Trump wants to be known and acknowledged as a ‘man of peace’. But his imperious conduct and record so far are at sharp variance with this.
True, his instincts are against war, and he vowed not to involve the US in foreign entanglements and what he called “endless stupid wars”. This is what he promised in his election campaign.
He also claimed he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. During the presidential campaign, J.D. Vance described Trump as the “candidate of peace”. In his victory speech, Trump declared, “I am not going to start wars. I am going to stop wars.”
 
 

But in his opening days in power, his aggressive statements sent a message that no ‘man of peace’ would be identified with. He threatened to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal, if necessary by military force, and turn Canada into the 51st state of the US by using “economic force”.
He also said the US would “take over Gaza” and relocate Palestinians outside their homeland. He unleashed a trade war by imposing sweeping tariffs against almost all countries in the world. His bullying approach and coercive methods prompted The Economist to describe him as a modern-day Don Corleone. Others likened his leadership style to mafia tactics both at home and abroad.
Despite Trump’s boastful claims of bringing a quick end to the Ukraine war, he has been unable to do that. He claims to have promoted peace in the Middle East by forging a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following their 12-day war.
But lighting a fire and then putting it out hardly makes him a peacemaker. Israel, the aggressor, would never have attacked Iran in the first place without a green light from Washington.
Trump acknowledged he had advance knowledge of Israel’s June 13 military assault. But he did nothing to stop Benjamin Netanyahu. Instead, he used nuclear talks with Iran as a smokescreen while the Israeli military was preparing to attack Iran.
Trump later described the attack as “excellent” and admitted he had coordinated closely with Netanyahu. Then, in flagrant violation of international law, he ordered US warplanes to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, declaring triumphantly this had “completely obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites and likening it to nuclear bombs dropped by the US on Japan in World War II. Is this what ‘men of peace’ do?

Trump’s imperious conduct and record so far contradict his claim of being a peacemaker.

Persuading Israel and Iran to agree to a ceasefire, which remains fragile, hardly supports Trump’s assertion to have established peace. Yes, the fighting has stopped for now, but peace is an altogether different matter.
Peace is established when disputes or issues are resolved. A ceasefire is what it says it is — a halt in active hostilities. Ceasefires can, of course, be a pathway to peace. But there is no chance of peace between Iran and Israel, who remain implacable enemies. Meanwhile, Trump declared he would bomb Iran again if the country was still able to enrich uranium to weapons-grade.
What contradicts Trump’s ‘peacemaker’ claim in the most barefaced way is his role in and support for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Despite his earlier statements that he wanted an expeditious end to the war, his actions prove the contrary.
He has thus far shown no willingness to restrain or stop Netanyahu from raining death and destruction on Gaza. While Trump has been trumpeting his peacemaking ‘credentials’, Gaza has only seen more bloodshed, displacement, devastation, and now, starvation and famine.
Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s US-backed war, the majority of them women and children. In fact, since Trump’s assumption of power, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and threatened to occupy all of the territory.
It has blocked humanitarian aid and used starvation as a weapon. Has Trump intervened to prevent any of this or, for that matter, Israel’s increasing military assaults on the occupied West Bank?
Obviously not. Instead, the US has used its veto to block resolutions in the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The most recent veto was exercised earlier this month that opposed an “immediate and permanent ceasefire”; it was the sixth US veto since the war began.
This has given Israel carte blanche to continue its killing spree and create a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Trump administration has remained unmoved by scenes of desperate, starving Palestinians, including children, being shot in cold blood by Israeli forces as they queue up for food at controversial military-run aid distribution sites set up with US backing.
In one month alone, over 500 aid-seekers have been killed. Washington has also not denied Israeli leaders’ claims that they are implementing Trump’s plan of forcible displacement of Palestinians by pushing them out of Gaza.
Despite this grim record, Trump feels he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Although he has cited several reasons for this, his claim rests principally on brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after their four-day conflict.
For that, the government of Pakistan recommended him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This ill-conceived move, aimed at ingratiating itself with Trump, was justified by the government on the grounds that he had intervened to de-escalate “a rapidly deteriorating situation” and secure a ceasefire that averted “a broader conflict between the two nuclear states”.
It is disingenuous to argue Trump’s intervention was the decisive factor, when it was nuclear deterrence that prevented the outbreak of all-out war.
Defusing a crisis, which Washington did, is not the same thing as averting a full-blown conflict. If it took Trump to avert a “broader conflict”, that would make Pakistan’s nuclear capability irrelevant.
If that is what the government thinks, then it has no confidence in the country’s security guarantor. Moreover, a peace award should be in recognition of the establishment of peace, which happens when contentious issues are resolved between warring parties. Has that happened?
What is touted as Trump’s doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is nothing other than the unilateral use of force and coercion in defiance of international law and global norms to impose US will. This is a recipe for chaos, not winning the peace.

CHAUDHRY Nisar Ali Khan greets Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Rumours of a probable political rapproachment began swirling in the federal capital on Sunday, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his estranged former party colleague, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Media reports said the PM arrived at Mr Nisar’s home with an offer to rejoin the PML-N. However, it could not be ascertained whether Mr Nisar accepted the offer or not.
It is believed the prime minister met Mr Nisar with the consent of his elder brother and PML-N president, Nawaz Sharif.
 






However, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the PM only inquired about Mr Nisar’s health.
“They discussed the national and international situation during the meeting,” said the official press release about the meeting that took place in a “very pleasant atmosphere” where the two leaders “revived memories of the past”.

PML-N leader refutes reports, says party in no mood to bring estranged leader

Videos of the meeting showed Mr Nisar’s son also sitting with his father during the meeting.
A senior PML-N leader told Dawn the PM only met Mr Nisar to inquire about his health, as he had not been well for the past few days.
There was no truth in reports that Mr Nisar had been asked to rejoin the party and that he assured the PM he would consider the offer, said the PML-N leader, who wished not to be named. “It is just a storm in a teacup.”
The PML-N leader stated it has not been discussed at any party forum that the top leadership wanted to bring back Mr Nisar into the fold.
PM Shehbaz might have remained in touch with Mr Nisar, but the disgruntled PML-N leader has severed all connections with Mr Nawaz since a long time, said the party leader.
 
 

The PML-N leader said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif now has a significant role in the party’s decision-making and “Mr Nisar had never been in her good books”.
He said the party apparently doesn’t need Mr Nisar because another leader, Engineer Qamarul Islam, has already won the same National Assembly seat from Taxila, which was Mr Nisar’s constituency.
He said after departing PML-N, Mr Nisar had spoken harshly against the party.
“This cannot be forgotten by party leaders. Therefore, there is no desire in the party to bring Mr Nisar back,” he added.
Another source said the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere, where the PM complained to Mr Nisar in a lighter tone, saying, “You have forgotten us.”
Mr Nisar denied the impression, saying he had been ill lately.
Sources said the PM also condoled the death of Mr Nisar’s sister, who died recently.
Once considered a trusted aide of Nawaz Sharif, he remained associated with the PML-N for 34 years. He parted ways with the party just before the 2018 general elections, following differences with the elder Sharif.

The accused included Nawazish Ali Hanjra, who was wanted in 23 cases of terrorism, murder and kidnapping and Haroon Iqbal, in a separate serious case.
They were apprehended on the basis of Interpol Red Notices issued at Pakistan’s request.
Legal proceedings are now underway to extradite the two men to stand trial in Pakistan.
The arrests followed a recent visit by the minister of state for interior, Talal Chaudhry, to Spain.
He met with Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska and formally requested the arrest and extradition of the two fugitives.
Mr Chaudhry emphasised the importance of mutual cooperation in combating transnational crime and terrorism, the ministry’s statement added.
The Spanish Minister of Interior had issued urgent directives to relevant authorities to act on the red notices issued by Pakistan.
Pakistan has been seeking the arrest and extradition of 38 fugitives from Spain, most of whom are wanted in criminal and terrorism-related cases.
These individuals had managed to evade justice for years, exploiting legal loopholes and a lack of coordination between international enforcement agencies, the ministry added.

The Jamshed  Quarters police stated that seven boys were sitting at a restaurant  near the Kanzul Iman mosque when an argument broke out over a minor  issue.
During the altercation, Abdul Rehman was pushed by one of the  boys, causing his head to strike the handle of a parked motorcycle. He  sustained critical injuries and died on the spot.
The police arrived  at the scene upon receiving information and detained six suspects. They were identified as Talha  Mohammed, Hasan alias Arif (a cousin of the deceased), Abdullah, Faraz  Sattar, Manan Ali and Moiz Mohammed.
The body was taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for medico-legal procedures.
Area SHO Anser Ahmed Butt told Dawn  that the scuffle  began between Manan Ali and Abdullah over the profile picture of  the latter’s girlfriend being found on the former’s  mobile phone. When  Abdul Reh­man attempted to inte­rvene, Manan allegedly  pushed him. He  slipped and fell, hitting his head on the motorcycle,  which caused his  instant death.
Meanwhile, police on Sunday claimed to have arrested two suspects for allegedly murdering a police constable and setting his body on fire in his North Karachi home in order to conceal their crime. They reportedly killed the constable over some personal enmity.

As monsoon rains continue across the country, authorities issued an urban flooding warning for several cities on Sunday, while glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan is threatening residents of downstream areas.
According to the National Disa­ster Management Authority’s Nat­i­onal Emergencies Operation Cen­tre (NEOC), significant rainfall activity is anticipated in Azad Kashmir, northeast Punjab, the Potohar region, Islamabad and upper and central parts of KP between June 29 and July 3.
According to Rescue 1122, two people were killed and a dozen injured in rain-related incidents in Lahore.  Meanwhile, two people were killed when the roof of a mud house collapsed in Sharifpura.
In Karachi, three people were electrocuted, while two sisters died after being swept away by floodwaters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
 

The NEOC warned that significant rainfall may result in urban flooding in low-lying areas of central KP, the Potohar region and Islamabad.
NEOC has also cautioned against possible flash flooding in the northern parts, including the Hazara and Malakand Divisions, lower parts of Jhelum and Poonch Valleys in AJK, and the Pir Panjal range. Furthermore, heavy to very heavy rainfall was forecasted in southern Sindh, particularly affecting Hyderabad, Badin, Thatta, and Karachi from June 29 to July 5.
Glacier melting
In GB, rapidly melting glaciers pose a constant threat for residents living in downstream areas.
The local administration said that many households in Tokorkot village in Nagar district have been shifted to safer locations, as the melting glacier near the village has eroded land, damaged agricultural fields, trees, and transmission lines, and put more than 15 homes at risk.

They had two paths: either treat their project as a mere requirement to earn the degree, or turn it into something that a giant like Google may be interested in.
They opted for the latter path, which led to the development of Geo Gemma — an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with the Google Earth Engine, to analyse spatial data and satellite imagery without the need for lengthy codes.
 






Last week, GeoGemma won the ‘Best AI Use Case’ award at the Asia-Pacific (APAC) Solution Challenge, jointly organised by Google and the Asian Development Bank in Manila.

Team from Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad say their innovation can be used across several fields, such as oil and gas, real estate, supply chain etc.

Speaking to Dawn from Manila, Mr Iqbal said GeoGemma was created with the idea of automating geospatial analysis.
“[The] Google Earth Engine hosts updated satellite imagery from the entire planet. There is 80 petabytes of data there, and you can overlay your maps to analyse different geographical variables — from temperature on K2 to thermal imaging,” he explained.
 
 

But this engine has its limitations; the user has to have a certain level of programming and coding expertise to retrieve satellite data and analyse it.
GeoGemma intended to change this — make this data accessible to anyone who wants to analyse it by writing just a few prompts detailing what data they need. Mr Iqbal and his team were able to accomplish this with funding from Google.
Around June last year, he came across a research grant opportunity by Gemma Academic Programme, organised by Google DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet that works on AI development.
Mr Iqbal, Mr Hunzala and their supervisor Dr Sajid Ghaffar formed a GeoAI team and applied for the grant. “[We] pitched our idea of fusing Google Earth Engine with the open-source Gemma model.”
In September 2024, the team got a $10,000 research grant from Google DeepMind.
APAC Solution Challenge
GeoGemma was selected as one of the top 10 projects from a pool of 750 entries from over 200 universities. A team from Fast University — who developed a Gemini-powered document editor for neurodivergent users — was the second team from Pakistan to make it to the top 10.
For the big stage, the team of two needed more resources. They included Abdullah Asif and Khaleelullah, two undergrads studying Computer Science at the IST. Mr Asif joined as the Front-end Web Developer, while Mr Khaleelullah was the tech lead and AI engineer.
Simplifying geospatial analysis
Mr Iqbal said GeoGemma is a simplified spatial analysis tool, which can fetch satellite data by understanding prompts in a natural language.
“We are actually pushing boundaries by building a simple model that can even be loaded on computers without the need of servers,” he said, adding the total size of a model is less than 2GB and it can run on any laptop.
 
 

He believes satellite imagery and remote sensing are at the cross-sections of many industries — sustainability, oil and gas, real estate, supply chain, etc.
The team plans to release their software before the end of this year.
“Right now, we have a solid foundation. We have recognition. We have credibility. But moving forward, there is so much potential in terms of industries we can partner with and make custom modules that’d be proprietary tools,” Mr Iqbal said about the future of GeoGemma.

Though the ruling has come in connection with a case initiated by Pakistan in 2016, it suggests that India’s decision to hold the IWT in ‘abeyance’ after the Pahalgam episode has no firm basis in international law and that, in the eyes of neutral observers, the treaty very much holds.
The court made the decision based on the text of the IWT, particularly the article stating that the treaty will hold until both states mutually withdraw from it. In the present circumstances, this is not the case, as Pakistan still honours the agreement.
Not surprisingly, while Pakistan has welcomed the decision, India has reacted in a belligerent manner. Casting aspersions on the court, it has rejected the decision, saying that it “has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration”.
This displays an alarming lack of respect for international institutions, and the language is not one associated with responsible states. If matters do not go India’s way, will it also reject the jurisdiction of august multilateral fora such as the UN’s International Court of Justice?
 
 

Moreover, New Delhi’s reaction borders on the conspiratorial, as the Indian external affairs ministry has characterised the court’s declaration as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.
This farcical assumption suggests that Pakistan has the power to control the decision-making process of independent international institutions. If the matter did not concern such a critical issue as water rights, the Indian reaction would have been seen as comical.
However, although Pakistan has achieved a legal success where upholding the IWT’s sanctity and rejecting the treaty’s unilateral suspension are concerned, it must be prepared to launch a robust legal and political defence of its water rights at all international fora.
 
 

India’s intentions regarding Pakistan’s share of water are hardly benign. In fact, the Indian home minister has said his country would “never” restore the IWT, and that Pakistan’s share of water would be diverted to Rajasthan. This indicates that India is not ready for a peaceful resolution of bilateral disputes, particularly matters related to water, even though Prime Minster Shehbaz Sharif recently reiterated his desire to engage with India on all issues.
As The Hague court’s observations have illustrated, Pakistan’s case is a strong one. The country must deploy the best legal and diplomatic minds to defend its water rights. India can still choose to engage with Pakistan so that outstanding issues can be sorted out peacefully. The grim alternative, if India deprives Pakistan of its water, will be more animosity and conflict.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump branded him a “pure communist” in remarks that aired on Sunday, an epithet the progressive candidate dismissed as political theatrics.
In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said his agenda of raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and on corporations to pay for ambitious policies such as free buses, a $30 minimum hourly wage and a rent freeze was not only realistic but tailored to meet the needs of the city’s working residents.
“It’s the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet one in four New Yorkers are living in poverty, and the rest are seemingly trapped in a state of anxiety,” he told NBC’s Kristen Welker.
Mamdani’s stunning victory over former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday’s primary election has some party figures worried that his democratic socialism could feed Republican attacks on Democrats as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Business leaders have also expressed concern about his policies.
 
 

Democrats have struggled to find a coherent message after their resounding loss in the November elections that saw President Donald Trump return to the White House and his Republicans win control of both chambers of Congress. A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed that a majority of American Democrats believed their party needs new leadership and to be more focused on economic issues.
Earlier on Sunday, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who represents part of the city, told ABC’s “This Week” that he wasn’t ready to endorse Mamdani yet, saying that he needed to hear more about Mamdani’s vision.
Other prominent New York Democrats, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have also thus far declined to endorse Mamdani.
Trump, himself a native New Yorker, told Fox News that if Mamdani wins the mayoral race, “he’d better do the right thing” or the White House would withhold federal funds from the city.
“He’s a communist. I think it’s very bad for New York,” Trump said. Asked about Trump’s claim that he is a communist, Mamdani told NBC it was not true and accused the president of attempting to distract from the fact that “I’m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed.”
He also voiced no concern that Jeffries and other Democrats have not yet endorsed his candidacy.

But within minutes, the calm waters turned violent, sweeping away an entire family in front of helpless onlookers.
As the surging brown torrents of the swollen river pounded the rocks beneath their feet, 14 tourists — men, women and children — stood huddled together, teetering between fading hope and overwhelming despair.
The family, belonging to Daska tehsil in Sialkot, had stopped for breakfast at Relax Hotel, located at the Fizagat picnic point on the outskirts of Mingora.
After their meal, they ventured onto the riverbed to take photographs. As they snapped selfies and recorded videos, the waters suddenly swelled, trapping them on a raised mound of stones and sand, left behind by quarrying work in the riverbed.
 
 

The river’s rapids quickly eroded the small, fragile piece of land beneath them. As bystanders captured the unfolding tragedy on their phones under a grey sky, members of the group began to fall into the torrent, one by one. Within minutes, all were swept away.

After 13 lives were lost in a flash flood, officials and experts weigh what could — and should — have been done to prevent the disaster

The short distance to safety — barely 100 metres — proved unreachable.
The incident has ignited public anger and raised serious questions about the provincial government’s emergency response, early warning systems and disaster preparedness.
Dawn spoke with officials and experts to piece together what really happened in Swat and evaluate the government’s role, the effectiveness of the emergency response, preparedness, and early warning systems.
What happened
Eyewitnesses said the group was stranded for over two hours and no one turned up to rescue them. But officials dispute this claim.
Shah Fahad, director general of Rescue 1122, told Dawn that CCTV footage from the hotel shows the tourists entering the riverbed around 9:37am. “The river was dry then, but within minutes, the water surged. By 9:45am, the river had risen dramatically,” he said.
Mr Fahad said the first call for help was received at 9:49am. However, a fatal miscommunication occurred. The operator misunderstood the nature of the emergency, treating it as a medical issue instead of a rescue operation.
An ambulance was dispatched and arrived at 9:56am. When responders realised they were faced with a river rescue, they requested a different vehicle. A disaster rescue vehicle, carrying generators, inflatable boats and other paraphernalia, was dispatched to the scene, but arrived too late.
He said an investigation was underway to find out whether the delay could have been due to operator error, or the caller’s failure to properly convey the nature of the emergency.
But there are slight variations, even in official records. According to information seen by Dawn,  the Swat district administration received its first alert at 9:55am, and a Rescue 1122 ambulance arrived at the scene around 10:07am. Rescue efforts began in earnest at 10:15am  with a locally made raft using inflated tubes.
By 10:36am, the  eroding riverbed gave way and the stranded tourists were swept into the  rapids. Video footage shows a raft, locally called a jaalai, approaching four people clinging to each other in knee-deep water. Official accounts claim three of them were rescued.
Several officials and rescue experts told Dawn  the River Swat’s rocky, shallow, fast-flowing nature makes it  unsuitable for divers or motorboats. Rescue 1122 has a rope gun capable  of launching lines up to 100 metres, but it couldn’t be used as there  was no anchor point across the river.
Why no helicopter?
A KP government official said a helicopter rescue was considered, but ultimately ruled out due to bad weather.
An emergency response expert told Dawn  that 95 per cent of crisis management is preparedness, and only 5pc is  the response. “You don’t send divers unless there’s a high chance of  survival — and in this case, there wasn’t.”
He regretted that Swat  has seen multiple floods since the 2010 floods, but little has been  done in terms of community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM). In  contrast, the Kalash valleys in Chitral have such systems in place.
“In  2015, the Bumburet valley faced severe flooding, but no lives were lost  because villagers upstream warned those downstream. That’s what CBDRM  looks like,” he said.
Early warning systems
Swat district spans over 5,000 square kilometres and has a population of 2.6 million. The Meteorological Department maintains three weather observatories here — in Saidu Sharif, Malam Jabba and Kalam.
On June 23, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority issued a weather advisory warning of a westerly wave approaching by June 25. It said the wave was likely to intensify on June 25 and directed authorities to take precautionary measures.
Data from the Met Department shows rainfall on June 27 measured 46mm in Saidu Sharif, 42mm in Malam Jabba and 4mm in Kalam. River gauges installed by the Irrigation Department in Khwazakhela recorded a morning discharge of 6,738 cusecs.
 
 

A senior Irrigation Department official told Dawn that Kalam valley was outside of the monsoon zone, which extends across Bahrain, Khwazakhela and Matta tehsils.
Another Irrigation Department official said the flash flood likely originated in Khwazakhela and Matta tehsils, fed by tributaries like Chaprial, Ningolay, Baryam and Shawar. Streams from Manglawar and Malam Jabba also contributed.
A telemetry system at Charbagh was reportedly non-functional, though Swat Executive Engineer Inamullah Khan denied its existence there, stressing that only Khwazakhela has such a system.
Former Swat deputy commissioner Shahzad Mehboob, who was transferred on Saturday, said the flood came too quickly for officials to respond. “Small tributaries of the River Swat swelled, and it reached the site within a very short span of time,” he said.
Yet questions remain: did officials in upstream tehsils — Khwazakhela, Matta, Charbagh and Babuzai — warn Mingora authorities in time? Could such a warning have triggered preventative action, avoiding the loss of lives?
On the evening of the tragedy, the KP government suspended the assistant commissioners of Babuzai and Khwazakhela for a delayed response and failure to issue an early warning. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Relief) was also suspended for failing to make arrangements.
Some officials questioned why life jackets were not dropped near the stranded tourists. Others criticised the lack of on-ground enforcement, stressing that while  alerts were issued, field action was lacking.

ON June 26, the United Nations Charter celebra­ted its 80th anniversary. The current international order is based on its principles, which stand out in its preamble: the prevention of war, equal rights of peoples and nations, justice, social progress and a better life for all.
All multilateral institutions subsumed under its creation since 1945, such as the United Nations Educa­tional, Scientific and Cultu­ral Organisa­tion, the Food and Agriculture Organi­sation and the UN Refugee Agency, etc. But unfortunately, we are seeing the principles of the UN Charter being disrespected in various parts of the world, precisely by the powers that considered themselves the creators and pillars of this order.
 
 

Today, we live in a very complex international context mark­ed by instability, regional wars, nuc­lear thr­eats, attacks on the sovereignty of sovereign countries, and the exacerbation of unilateralism. The current global order is undergoing a profound stress test, which is producing challen­ges and many opportunities.
Western powers claim to be the creators and defenders of the rules that govern the coexistence between nations. This stance is reflected in the preponderance of a Western logic, which seeks to impose its political, economic and ideological models on the rest of the world as if they were universal.

There is a large concentration of Anglo-American voices, while few voices have been heard from countries of the Global South as if non-Western peoples cannot have their own perspectives on the essence of international politics

The history of European imperialism and colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries contains an enormous list of atrocities committed in the name of a “civilising “and “evangelising” mission. In addition to military, political and economic domination, Western nations have developed an extensive theoretical and ideological apparatus, especially with regard to international relations. In this field, there is a large concentration of Anglo-American voices, while few voices have been heard from countries of the Global South as if non-Western peoples cannot have their own perspectives on the essence of international politics. In undergraduate courses worldwide, international relations manuals naturalise the Western view as if it were the only truly valid analytical perspective.
Realistic theorists of international relations, such as Samuel Hunting­ton, with his theses on modernisation and the clash of civilisations; Francis Fukuyama, who argued that the Western liberal model would be the end of history; and Graham Allison, who deals with the inevitability of a clash between the great powers in “Thucydides Trap”, receive an amplified audience by arguing that the international order is a zero-sum game and that the security and well-being of a nation can only be sustained at the expense of the interests of other countries.
In essence, realism brings with it the values of individualism and the idea that human beings are merely a rational maximiser of petty interests. From there, realist political scientists extrapolate experience at the individual level to the behavior of nation-states, postulating hegemony as the only acceptable condition for a great power.
There are other Western theories of international relations, such as liberalism, which postulates the universalisation of its own notion of democracy and human rights, which has often served as a pretext for interventions and regime changes around the world. Even the constructivist theory, which appears to be more progressive by incorporating non-state agents such as nongovernmental organisations, social movements, trade union federations and churches, etc, into the decision-making process, is used as an instrument of destabilisation via so-called colour revolutions, which are instruments of hybrid wars.
At this point, it is worth highlighting that the three Anglo-American theories are used to maintain the status quo in the international order, in which the hegemony of the United States prevails. In this context, the ideas of Amitav Acharya are conducive to reflecting on the role of countries in the Global South in this process, as they can contribute new concepts about the relationship between civilisations, nations and people that do not mean hegemonism, supremacism, unilateralism or zero-sum logic.
To this end, we could incorporate into the debate on the creation of a new international institutional framework concepts and philosophies from outside the Western world, such as the African concept of Ubuntu, which assumes that human beings are part of a broader and more meaningful relational community. According to this philosophy, people must be open and available to others, support those close to them, not feel threatened when others are capable and good, join forces to achieve better results, and understand that the differences between people are what generate growth.
Likewise, we could mention the Taoist principle of Yin and Yang, in which opposites complement each other, the Confucian moral authority, and the umbilical relationship between man and nature expressed in the Inca concept of Pachamama.
In conclusion, humanity should be viewed as a large garden, not a vast eucalyptus plantation. Civilisations, cultures and ethnic groups are flowers that contribute to the beauty of this garden.
Humanity is facing a challenging crisis. It is necessary to strive for the birth of a new world order that guarantees all people enjoy the realisation of all the promises made 80 years ago when the UN was created. Peace, security and prosperity will be the collective fruits.

• Officials blame a ‘newly-constructed but untested’ tunnel that still cannot be used to release water from reservoir
PUNJAB and Sindh are facing varying levels of water shortages, despite abundant availability of water in the river system. But that water cannot be released due to operational issues at the Tarbela Dam, which Wapda has failed to address in time.
This is a Catch-22 for the authorities. If the water release is forced, it might compromise the production of around 1,500MW of electricity during the peak summer season, when every megawatt is worth its weight in gold due to high demand.
According to official data, the water inflow in rivers on Friday was 435,900 cusecs, around 131,200 cusecs more than the inflow on the same day last year.
The inflow was also 95,800 cusecs higher than the last five-year average of 340.1 cusecs.
This year, the Indus river carried 14.97 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its 10-year average of 11.4MAF between April 1 and June 20.
However, this glut was mildly offset by a drop in water levels of other rivers — Kabul by 37 per cent, Jehlum by 24pc and Chenab by 8pc.
Still, the water in Indus resulted in the storage of 4.6MAF of water in Tarbela and Mangla dams, which is 1.4MAF more than the last five-year average of 3.26MAF.
Despite this healthy supply, Sindh received only 153,000 cusecs on Friday, against its demand of 180,000 cusecs, resulting in a 15pc shortage.
Similarly, Punjab received 122,000 cusecs against its demand of 145,000 cusecs, resulting in a deficit of 16pc.
The shortages have disturbed the water calculation for irrigation and imperilled the sowing of maize and rice, and the maturing of cotton and sugarcane.
The Indus River System Authority (Irsa), which distributes water among provinces, has demanded 195,000 cusecs of water from the Indus river, but is only getting 150,000 cusecs, a shortage of 45,000 cusecs.
The deficit is naturally being passed on to Punjab and Sindh, resul­ting in much flak for the water regulator.
On June 24, the Sindh government wrote a letter to the Irsa protesting the reduced water supply during the sowing season.
 
 

In response, the regulator wrote a letter to Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), which constructs and manages water reservoirs, complaining that its demand for water from Tarbela Dam wasn’t being fulfilled.
Besides provincial shortages, the Mangla dam can also not be filled due to lesser releases from Tarbela, leaving Irsa unable to fully meet Punjab’s demand for water.
The water regulator urged Wapda to release water as per its demand to “prevent agricultural loss to the farming community”.
Untested outlet — the culprit
On its part, Irsa blames water shortages on technical issues at the Tarbela Dam, caused by the construction of Tunnel-5.
According to Irsa spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana, Tunnel-5 was built to produce an additional 1,450 MW of electricity. With it, Wapda added another low-level outlet (LLO) to release 30,000 cusecs of water from the dam when required.
Water is released from a dam via two outlets: spillways and tunnels. Spillways are giant gates that are opened when the dam is completely filled. When the dam is not fully filled, the water is released via tunnels and outlets below the spillways.
These outlets require extensive testing after construction to ensure they withstand the water pressure without damaging the dam’s structural integrity.
Wapda sought a 33-month no-objection certificate to build, test and operationalise the outlet.
The deadline expires today (June 30), but Wapda has been unable to even test the outlet, let alone use it for water discharge.
 
 

Azam Joya, Wapda general manager (C&M), told Dawn the authority tested the LLO in 2023 by releasing water to 13pc of its capacity, but the gushing water hit transmission lines and blew them away.
Later, transmission lines were raised higher with new poles installed in the next 10 months.
In 2024, the outlet was tested to 82pc capacity when it started vibrating and the test was aborted for corrective measures.
The issues have now been addressed but final testing — an operational necessity — couldn’t be done due to the unexpected rise in water level in the Indus river.
According to Mr Joya, the outlet can only be tested after summer when the water recedes.
Reality, for now
Wapda is now in a quandary — it can release water through the untested outlet and jeopardise not only the outlet but also tunnel T-5 and perhaps the entire dam and knock 1,450MW electricity out of the system or it can wait for the water to recede and then test the outlet.
A former Wapda official said the authority lacked the weight to take such big decisions; either open the outlet untested or continue inflicting water shortages on provinces.
“Political and government leaders should take it up and decide the matter because it involves massive financial and political cost,” said the ex-Wapda official, who wished not to be named because he was not authorised to speak on the issue.
Whatever the case may be, a decision should be made “before it gets to a level where everyone starts feeling the heat”.
For now, it appears the provinces will have to live with water shortages, as any water release from the untested outlet is too risky.
“The Irsa and the nation have to live with this reality,” said Mr Rana, the water regulator spokesperson, implying water shortages for the time being.

The bunker-bus­ter assault, launched under Trump’s direction, marked a rare instance of a direct US attack on Iranian soil.
Although the immediate result was a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, the strategic and ethical implications of the strike are far more disturbing than they first appeared.
Following the US strike, Iran launched only minimal retaliatory attacks before agreeing to what amounts to a ceasefire of near surrender. Israel, too, accepted this halt in hostilities. On the surface, it might appear that American power forced a pause in the conflict. But beneath that silence lies a storm: in Iran, anger and humiliation are growing — particularly among the youth — who might view this sequence of events not as fair but as public submission to Western aggression.
That sentiment raises a chilling historical parallel: the 9/11 attacks in 2001. At the time, many Ameri­cans saw the attacks as inexplicable acts of evil. However, later analyses revealed that the roots of such extremism lay in decades of unilateral, arrogant and often violent US interventions in the Middle East.
The young people in the Arab world or Islamic nations radicalised during those years saw the United States not as a beacon of freedom but as a hubristic superpower trampling their sovereignty. The fear now is that Trump’s latest strike may sow the seeds of yet another 9/11-style backlash — this time from another generation filled with rage and defiance.
 
 

The UN Security Council did not approve the military strike, nor was there any consensus among US allies. There is no clear evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring a preemptive US strike. In short, the action violated fundamental principles of international law — specifically, the prohibition against unilateral use of force without Security Council authorisation or a clear case of self-defence.
The alarming point is that the US is responsible for protecting the rule of no unilateral use of force. Even more concerning is the fact that Trump’s strike appeared to align with Israel’s aggressive posture toward Iran.
In recent months, Israel has conducted multiple attacks on Iranian targets, citing concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme. There are indeed reasons to be concerned about the programmes from an Israeli perspective. However, such doubt can not justify the preventive strike in any form.
Now, by acting in concert with — or perhaps on behalf of — Israel, the United States has compromised its traditional image as an objective mediator in the region. Instead, it has cast itself as a direct participant in the conflict, blurring the line between diplomacy and warfare.
This is not an isolated event. During his presidency, Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal.

Beijing rolled over $2.1bn, which has been in Pakistan’s central bank’s reserves for the last three years, and refinanced another $1.3bn commercial loan, which Islamabad had paid back two months ago, the sources said.
The officials asked not to be named as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly ahead of an official announcement.
Another $1bn from Middle Eastern commercial banks and $500 million from multilateral financing have also been received, one of the officials said.
“This brings our reserves in line with the IMF target,” he said.
The loans, especially those from China, are critical to shoring up Pakistan’s low foreign reserves, which the IMF required to be over $14bn at the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.

• Despite US strikes, Tehran can resume enrichment ‘in months’, IAEA warns
TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday expressed “serious doubts” that Israel will abide by a US-brokered ceasefire that ended their 12-day war, demanding that the United Nations hold Tel Aviv and Washington responsible for the conflict.
The conflict began on June 13, when Israel launched a bombing campaign targeting military commanders and scientists linked to Iran’s nuclear programme.
“We did not start the war, but we have responded to the aggressor with all our power,” Iran’s armed forces chief of staff, Abdolrahim Mousavi, was quoted as saying by state television.
“We have serious doubts over the enemy’s compliance with its commitments including the ceasefire, we are ready to respond with force.”
During the war, Iran say it arrested dozens of people it accused of spying for Israel, and also seized equipment including drones and weapons.
Iran’s parliament on Sunday voted to ban the unauthorised use of communications equipment, including tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service, according to the official news agency IRNA.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Tehran has formally requested that the Security Council blame its adversaries for the war and compel them to pay for damages.
 
 

“We officially request hereby that the Security Council recognise the Israeli regime and the United States as the initiators of the act of aggression and acknowledge their subsequent responsibility, including the payment of compensation and reparations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote.
Enrichment resumption
Despite US assertions that its strikes obliterated key nuclear sites, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog cast doubt on how effective the campaign was in permanently halting Iran’s progress.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran could be producing enriched uranium again within months.
“The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that,” Grossi told CBS News.
He noted that while strikes on facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan significantly set back Iran’s abilities, its nuclear knowledge is irreversible.
“You cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Mr Grossi said.
Casualties and talks
The war killed at least 627 civilians in Iran and injured 4,900, according to Iran’s health ministry.
Retaliatory missile attacks by Iran killed 28 people in Israel, Israeli authorities said.
One of the deadliest single events of the war was an Israeli strike last Monday on Tehran’s Evin prison, which Iran’s judiciary said on Sunday killed at least 71 people.
The victims included staff, guards, prisoners, and visiting relatives.
The facility is known for holding political prisoners and foreign nationals.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the strike “unacceptable” but said two detained French nationals held at Evin for three years were not believed to have been harmed.
Iran’s prison authority said it transferred an unspecified number of inmates out of the prison after the attack.
The fighting derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, a staunch ally of Israel. US president, who announced the ceasefire, has threatened further stri­kes if Iran enriches uranium to worrisome levels.
According to the IAEA, Iran enriched uranium to 60pc in 2021, far beyond the 3.67pc limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.
Uranium enriched to 90pc is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.

“Make the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold talks later in the day on the progress of Israel’s offensive.
A senior security official said the military will tell him the campaign is close to reaching its objectives, and warn that expanding fighting to new areas in Gaza may endanger the remaining Israeli hostages.

Trump urges end to the war; Hamas signals readiness to resume talks

But in a statement posted on X and text messages sent to many residents, the military urged people in northern parts of the enclave to head south towards the Al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis.
 
 

“The (Israeli) Defence Forces is operating with extreme force in these areas, and these military operations will escalate, intensify, and extend westward to the city centre to destroy the capabilities of terrorist organisations,” the military said.
The evacuation order covered the Jabalia area and most Gaza City districts.
Ceasefire push
The escalation comes as Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, begin a new ceasefire effort to halt the 20-month-old conflict and secure the release of Israeli and foreign prisoners still being held by Hamas.
A Hamas official told Reuters the group had informed the mediators it was ready to resume ceasefire talks, but reaffirmed the group’s outstanding demands that any deal must end the war and secure an Israeli withdrawal from the coastal territory.
Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining prisoners in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, only in a deal that will end the war.
23 killed in strikes
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes and gunfire killed 23 people in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory on Sunday, including three children.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that his services “transported 23 martyrs, including several children and women” killed in various locations around the Gaza Strip.
Separately, the Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that a 20-year-old soldier was killed “during combat in the northern Gaza Strip”.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that the first tremor struck Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri, and surrounding areas at 3:24am with a magnitude of 5.5 and a depth of 28km, while the second tremor, measuring 4.8, was recorded at 7:30am.
“Aftershocks continued for a brief period in the affected areas,” officials in Musakhail told Dawn, adding that residents were reluctant to re-enter their homes due to the tremors.
The epicenter of the moderate earthquake was located approximately 60 kilometres north-northeast of Barkhan, a mountainous district headquarters in Balochistan province bordering Punjab. There were also reports that tremors were felt in some bordering areas of Punjab.

Tremors also felt in Rarashram, Kingri and surrounding areas; hundreds of homes partially affected

“The tremors continued to jolt Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri, and surrounding areas for around 30 seconds, causing many houses to collapse,” local administration officials said, adding that two houses were completely destroyed.
According to initial reports, five people, including a woman, were brought to the rural health centre with injuries sustained from collapsing houses.
“A couple was injured when the roof of their house was badly damaged during the earthquake,” levies officials said, adding that the condition of two injured individuals was serious, and they were shifted to District Hospital Loralai.
The officials added that over a hundred mud houses were partially damaged, rendering many residents homeless, who were being moved to safe locations. The boundary wall of the Government High School in the area also collapsed.
Musakhail Deputy Commissioner Bilal Shabbir confirmed that five people were injured in the quake-related incidents. “The rescue and relief teams reached the affected areas soon after the earthquake,” he told Dawn.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) stated that the district control room was activated immediately after the tremors were felt, and damage assessments are ongoing. Preliminary data indicates that hundreds of homes have been partially affected, and a detailed survey has been initiated.
Meanwhile, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement that initial relief operations have begun in Tehsil Kingri of Musakhail. He added that once the final report is compiled, complete details of the losses will be shared.
Tremors were also felt in nearby Barkhan district, adding to concerns in the region. Authorities continue to monitor the situation as aftershocks remain a possibility.

• Announces removal of PTV fee from utility bills
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday pledged that his government would never discourage the country’s solarisation boom, as he launched the ‘Power Smart’ mobile app to empower citizens and promote transparency in electricity billing under the ‘Apna Meter, Apni Reading’ initiative.
Addressing the launch ceremony in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz emphasised the government’s support for renewable energy, calling solar power a vital and growing resource for the nation.
“The government would not discourage the solarisation boom in the country, rather we welcomed the ongoing process, which is regarded as the most inexpensive way of producing electricity in the world,” the prime minister said.
He noted that the rapid adoption of solar energy is a key trend in the country.
“Pakistan is among the few countries where the solarisation process is rapidly taking place,” he added.
 
 

The premier identified the widening gap between high electricity production capacity and lower grid consumption due to solar adop­tion as a challenge the government is actively working to address.
Power Smart App
The ‘Power Smart’ app introduced under the ‘Apna Meter Apni Reading’ initiative is designed to empower consumers by allowing them to take a photograph of their electricity meter on a specified date and upload it to the app.
The monthly bill is then generated based on the uploaded image.
If a user provides a reading on the designated due date, that reading will be prioritised over any reading taken later by a utility employee, according to a statement from the Power Division.
“This is not just a technology feature but a solid reform in governance, which truly empowers consumers,” the Power Divi­sion said.
“With this system, consumers will not only be able to keep an eye on their bill, but now they will also be the guardians of the reading process.”
Officials highlighted that the system will particularly protect subsidy-eligible consumers.
A delay or error in meter reading can push a household’s consumption just over a subsidised slab, causing bills to spike dramatically.
For example, a bill for up to 200 units is approximately Rs 2,330, but if consumption rises even slightly above that, the bill can jump to over Rs 8,000 as the subsidy is removed.
“Through this app, it will be possible to ensure that the beneficiaries benefit from their subsidy by providing timely readings,” the Power Division said.
The application, available in five languages to improve accessibility across provinces, is intended to significantly reduce complaints related to over billing and unnecessary interference.
Federal Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari said the initiative aims to give the responsibility of meter reading to consumers themselves.
“Meter readers mechanism has now been handed over to consumers through the developed app,” he said, adding that overbilling had been a major issue and the government had reimbursed billions of rupees to consumers charged in this regard.
Consumers can download the app from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, the Power Division announced on X.
 






PTV fee removal
The prime minister also announced the removal of the Pakistan Television (PTV) fee from electricity bills.
Currently, consumers are charged a Rs35 monthly PTV fee through their electricity bills.
The PTV fee was a required charge in monthly electricity bills for years, however the government decided to abolish it to help households facing rising utility costs.
Vital reforms
The prime minister also highlighted that merit-based appointments have been made in the boards of power distribution companies (Discos) and that effective steps have been taken against corruption.
“Throughout Pakistan, vital reforms are introduced in the Discos boards where merit-based appointments are made,” he said.
PM also pointed to tough negotiations with independent power producers (IPPs) that led to a reduction in electricity prices by Rs7.5 per unit.
“We implemented ref­or­ms in the power sector but have a long way to go. We brought merit-based appoi­ntments in the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.
“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he added.
PM Shehbaz identified power theft as the biggest remaining challenge, costing the country an estimated Rs500 billion annually.
He said strong efforts are underway to curb the menace.
The prime minister concluded by emphasising the government’s commitment to further reducing power tariffs for both industrial and household consumers and called for increased public awareness about the new app.

• Relief worked out based on Nepra’s tariff determination, power purchase price, reduced subsidies under IMF deal
• Regulator to hold public hearing on Tuesday to consider Centre’s application
ISLAMABAD: The government wants to reduce the electricity price for consumers across the country starting July 1, it emerged on Sunday.
The federal government has filed a petition with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), requesting a Rs1.15 per unit reduction in the tariff.
The change would be applicable to all but lifeline domestic consumers.
The power division has advised against any change in electricity rates for the first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they were already over-subsidised.
Nepra has called a public hearing on July 1 to complete the formality before notification and application of the revised tariff.
According to the petition, the per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in the 50 to 100 units range.
For all other consumers and categories, the government has sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26, but the relief ranges between 3 to 10 per cent depending on their respective rates at present.
For example, protected consumers in the 1 to 100 units range would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab — from 101 to 200 units — in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers — those consuming more than 200 units — will be charged Rs23.44 instead of Rs23.59 per unit for the first 100 units, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories, including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would vary from 3 to 4pc but flat Rs1.15 per unit.
The average rate would come at around Rs31.60 per unit, down from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.
These rates have been worked out on the basis of Nepra’s tariff determinations for all distribution companies to meet their revenue requirements, aggregate power purchase prices in FY2025-26 and reduced subsidy allocations in the federal budget under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Nepra had determined Rs34 per unit national average tariff for FY2025-26 against Rs35.50 per unit this year.
 
 

The proposed tariff has been worked out after incorporating about 12.9pc lower subsidy allocation in the budget at Rs1.04 trillion for FY 2025-26 against Rs1.19tr in FY2024-25.
This includes an inter-Disco tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249.14bn in FY2025-26 against Rs276bn in the outgoing year, down 10pc.
Subsidy for tariff differential to tubewells in Balochistan will be Rs4bn in 2025-26, down from Rs 9.5bn in 2024-25.
The amount of subsidies for merged districts of KP and former Fata has been reduced by over 38pc to Rs40bn for FY 2025-26 from Rs 65bn for FY2024-25.
On the other hand, subsidy allocation for K-Electric has also been scaled down by 28pc, from Rs174bn in the outgoing fiscal year to Rs125bn for next year.
Likewise, the TDS for Azad Jammu and Kashmir has also been slashed by 31.5pc from Rs108bn this year to Rs74bn.
The subsidy allocation for Pakistan Energy Resolving Fund — meant to ensure timely payments to Chin­ese investors — has been protected at Rs48bn while TDS for the tribal region has been cut by 39pc from Rs65bn to Rs40bn instead.
However, a subsidy allocation of Rs400bn has been made in the budget, slightly higher than Rs394bn in FY2025-26.
The power division said its petition was in line with the National Electricity Policy, 2021 which provided under Clause 5.6.1 that the “financial sustainability of the sector is premised on the recovery of full cost of service, to the extent feasible, through an efficient tariff structure, which ensures sufficient liquidity in the sector”.
It said the proposed tariff was in line with the Nepra-determined rates for all Discos, the socio-economic objectives and budgetary targets.
The latest uniform tariff for Discos was set by Nepra through its determination dated July 13, 2024 that had been notified on July 14.
The Power Division said it had submitted to the federal cabinet on Saturday (June 28) the proposed uniform tariff.
Accordingly, the uniform tariff, being reflective of the federal government’s economic and social policy and based on the consolidated revenue requirement approved and determined by the regulator, was anticipated to receive unchanged approval.
The Power Division said the government will also maintain a uniform consumer-end tariff for K-Electric and Discos, even after their privatisation, through direct or indirect subsidies.
Accordingly, KE applicable uniform variable charge is required to be modified to recover the revenue requirements of KE determined by the Nepra in view of the proposed targeted subsidy and cross subsidies.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. According to rescue officials, at least 32 people have been killed across four provinces over the last two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses. Meanwhile, some people lost their lives due to electrocution.
On Sunday, Rescue 1122 issued a statement outlining more deaths and injuries in Lahore as a result of rain-related incidents.
“Rescue 1122 received 10 emergency calls about collapsing walls in different parts of the city,” the statement read. “One woman was killed and 10 others were seriously injured. They were moved to different hospitals and received medical aid in Rescue Emergency ambulances.”
The statement added that there were also reports of falling trees across Lahore due to strong winds and rain, however, there were no fatalities or injuries.
“Rescue 1122 staff are present at the highways and are removing fallen trees from the roads,” the statement added.
However, in a separate report, Rescue 1122 said that a billboard fell due to the intense rain and wind and fell on a motorcyclist and his family in Lahore.
According to Rescue 1122, the 50-year-old motorcyclist was killed, while his 35-year-old wife and child were injured, bringing the overall death toll to eight. The injured were transported to Jinnah Hospital.

In Karachi, two people, including the younger brother of former lawmaker and PPP Karachi leader Javed Nagori, were electrocuted in rain-related incidents, according to officials and relatives.
City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz told Dawn.com that Abdullah Anwar, 41, was sitting at a meeting place in Khadda Market near Sumair Arcade in Lyari, where an electric wire had fallen.
He said Anwar attempted to plug something into a rainwater-drenched wall socket when he suffered an electric shock and died. The SSP said the victim was dead with the wire in his hand when the police arrived.
The body was moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors confirmed the cause of death as an electric shock, said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
Nagori, while speaking briefly to Dawn.com, confirmed that the victim was his younger brother.
In another incident, a young man was electrocuted in the metropolis’ Clifton area. Boat Basin Police Station House Officer Malik Riaz Niazi said the man, in his early 30s, was passing by the Parklane Hospital when he apparently touched a wet electric pole and suffered an electric shock.
The body was moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Earlier in the day, rescue official Sherbaz Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that two sisters died after being swept away by flood waters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit Baltistan.
Meanwhile, in Punjab’s Sharifpura, two people were killed and one injured when the roof of a mud house collapsed. The bodies and the injured were shifted to Services Hospital, according to Rescue 1122.
Heavy rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab over the past 24 hours, according to Irfan Ali Kathia, Director General of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Lahore Airport recorded 65 mm of rain, while 32mm was recorded in Chakwal and 14mm in Dera Ghazi Khan 14. Rain was also recorded in Attock, Noorpur, Thal, Narowal, Kasur, Jhang, Toba, Tek Singh, Bhakkar and Khanewal.
“This spell of monsoon rain will likely continue until July 1,” Kathia was quoted as saying.
“Monsoon rains are also expected across most districts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said.
The DG urged citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.
“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a reasonable distance. In case of emergency, contact PDMA helpline 1129.”
Wasa Lahore instructed to be on full alert amid heavy rainfall
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the Water and Sewage Authority (Wasa) to remain on full alert in Lahore as heavy rains and strong winds began in various parts of the city.
Rain was recorded in Lakshmi Chowk, Qurtaba Chowk, Mazang, Data Nagar, Islampura, Shahdara, Ek Moria, Bhati Gate, Baghbanpura and Gulshan Ravi.
The Punjab CM directed senior Wasa officials to keep all main highways and underpasses clear, with pumps and staff ready at all underpasses.
Instructions were issued to keep all generators on standby with their fuel supply ensured, while field teams were instructed to remain active.
 






It was recommended that disposal stations be run on generators in areas with power outages, with the pumps of all disposal stations being kept clean and operational.
All town directors were directed to maintain complete monitoring of their towns.
Glof warning issued in Gilgit
The GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and flash floods.
“Due to intense heat and the western weather system, the ice in the glaciers of GB is melting rapidly, resulting in an increased risk of glacial floods and flash floods.
 
 

“This situation can pose a serious threat to communication roads, bridges, agricultural lands and human life and property,” the alert said.
The public and tourists were requested to ensure their safety and avoid unnecessary travel in extreme or uncertain weather conditions.
They were also advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
“The public is urged to avoid staying unnecessarily on glaciers, river banks or bridges, cross floodwaters on foot or any vehicle, and remember the instructions issued by rescue agencies.”
The district administration reiterated in its alert that natural disasters can strike at any time, and necessary precautions should be undertaken.  “In case of any emergency, immediately contact the district control room at 920724-05811.”</p><small>2025-06-29 19:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/292312275f910f6.png?r=231328' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints' target='_blank'><strong>Indian defence attache claims PAF downed Indian fighter jets because of ‘political leadership’s constraints’</strong></a><br><p>An Indian defence attache has claimed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) shot down six Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter aircraft “only because of the constraint given by the political leadership to not attack the military establishment or their air defences”, Indian news outlet The Wire reported on Sunday.
Earlier this month, the PAF confirmed that six IAF jets were shot down late on the night of May 7, after India launched missiles at six Pakistani sites, including in Sialkot and Bahawalpur, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Three of the downed fighters were French-made Dassault Rafales.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam in April — an allegation that Islamabad denied.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in Indonesia last month, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
 


During his presentation at the event, Kumar acknowledged the loss of Indian planes, though he said he “may not agree [with an earlier Indonesian speaker’s claim] that we lost so many aircraft”.
“After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for the military installations. So, we first achieved suppression of enemy air defences and then that’s why all our attacks could easily go through using Brahmos missiles,” the Indian defence attache added, referring to Indian missile strikes on Pakistani bases on the night of May 9 and 10.
According to Kumar, IAF fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer. “It was possibly based on the premise that the Pakistan military would not target Indian fighter aircraft flying in the Indian airspace, when India was not hitting any Pakistani military targets.”
Kumar inferred that the restrictions imposed by New Delhi led to the loss of IAF jets since Pakistan “refused to impose any such limitations”.
“The political directions had meant that IAF had to carry out their missions while deliberately avoiding the most threatening enemy assets, which are typically prioritised in air campaigns to secure air superiority,” The Wire reported.
The Wire also reported that the Indian Embassy in Jakarta said Captain Kumar’s remarks had been “taken out of context” in a statement.
“We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by the defence attache at a seminar. His remarks have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a misrepresentation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker,” The Wire wrote.
“The presentation conveyed that the Indian Armed Forces serve under civilian political leadership, unlike some other countries in our neighbourhood,” the outlet continued. “It was also explained that the objective of Operation Sindoor was to target terrorist infrastructure, and the Indian response was non-escalatory.”</p><small>2025-06-29 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29234745c9b3382.jpg?r=234837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921038/trump-blasts-communist-winner-of-new-york-mayoral-democratic-primary' target='_blank'><strong>Trump blasts ‘communist’ winner of New York mayoral Democratic primary</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump branded the winner of New York City’s mayoral Democratic primary a “pure communist” in remarks that aired Sunday, an epithet the progressive candidate dismissed as political theatrics.
Zohran Mamdani’s shock win last week against a scandal-scarred political heavyweight resonated as a thunderclap within the party, and drew the ire of Trump and his collaborators, who accused Mamdani of being a radical extremist.
The Republican’s aggressive criticism of the self-described democratic socialist is sure to ramp up over the coming months as Trump’s party seeks to push Democrats away from the political centre and frame them as too radical to win major US elections.
“He’s pure communist” and a “radical leftist … lunatic,” Trump fumed on Fox News talk show ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’. “I think it’s very bad for New York,” added Trump, who grew up in the city and built his sprawling real estate business there.
“If he does get in, I’m going to be president and he is going to have to do the right thing [or] they’re not getting any money” from the federal government.
Trump’s White House has repeatedly threatened to curb funding for Democratic-led US cities if they oppose his policies, including cutting off money to so-called sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with
immigration authorities.
 
 

Mamdani also took to the talk shows on Sunday, asserting he would “absolutely” maintain New York’s status as a sanctuary city so that “New Yorkers can get out of the shadows and into the full life of the city that they belong to.”
Asked directly on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ whether he is a communist, Mamdani — a 33-year-old immigrant aiming to become New York’s first Muslim mayor — responded, “No, I am not.
“And I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I’m from, who I am, ultimately because he wants to distract from what I’m fighting for,” Mamdani said.
“I’m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.”
 


The Ugandan-born state assemblyman had trailed former governor Andrew Cuomo in polls but surged on a message of lower rents, free daycare and buses, and other populist ideas in the notoriously expensive metropolis.
Although registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one in New York, victory for Mamdani in November is not assured.
Current Mayor Eric Adams is a Democrat but is campaigning for re-election as an independent, while Cuomo may also run unaffiliated.</p><small>2025-06-29 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611593-heres-a-list-of-countries-where-pakistanis-can-now-travel-without-visa' target='_blank'><strong>Here's a list of countries where Pakistanis can now travel without visa</strong></a><br><p>

On June 28, 2009, Deen Mohammad Baloch was reported missing after he was allegedly picked up by unknown men from the hospital where he worked in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district. A father of three, Dr Deen was one of the many Baloch people who have gone missing in the province — an issue that remains largely unaddressed, despite persistent pleas of their families, who still long for their loved ones to return, uncertain whether they are dead or alive.
According to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIOED) — a governmental body set up in 2011 to trace missing persons — the total number of missing persons cases received up to December 2024 was 10,467, while 8,216 cases were disposed of, with a total of 6,599 people traced so far.
“In these 16 years, I have tried everything — protested on the streets since I was a child, endured violence at the hands of police, pleaded in front of courts, spent time in jail — just to find where my father is,” said Sammi, a social rights activist.

Addressing the audience at the gathering, Sammi, who was 10 when her father went missing, said: “I am still the same Sammi I was when my father was taken away, a grieving daughter who has been longing for her father’s return for 16 years now.
“Today, I find myself in the same position I was 16 years ago — restless, uncertain and stuck in a cycle of never-ending wait.”
Speaking of her years-long struggle, she said, “My slogans, my hope and the tears in my eyes have not changed over these years, but instead of justice, all I ever received from the state was deafening silence”.
 
 

And yet she remained hopeful of her father’s return, “My voice may get drowned out in the hubris, but my hope for my father’s return will never waver,” she said.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn.com, Sammi expressed despair about the future, alleging that “state repression of Baloch activists had intensified in recent months.”
“We don’t know when we might be picked up, jailed, or have a case filed against us.”
In March, Sammi was detained during a protest at the Karachi Press Club calling for the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) leaders arrested in Quetta, including group leader Mahrang Baloch. BYC is a Baloch rights advocacy group working since 2018.

‘Space for dialogue rapidly closing’
Speaking at the event, veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas raised alarm that the “space for political dialogue on the issue was rapidly closing”.
“A political matter should only be resolved through political means,” Abbas said, adding that sweeping issues under the carpet was “going to make matters worse”.
Journalist Wasatullah Khan cautioned that by doing nothing, “we are leaving the course of events to time itself.”
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) President Asad Butt questioned how, in 16 years, the state had been unable to tell whether Dr Deen Mohammad is alive.
Butt urged people to stand with the Baloch cause, stating that the even if one person was missing, it raised serious questions about the entire justice system, adding that “remaining silent in the face of such injustice is a cruelty in itself”.</p><small>2025-06-29 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611584-in-call-with-coas-irans-military-chief-thanks-pakistan-for-support-amid-israeli-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>In call with COAS, Iran's military chief thanks Pakistan for support amid Israeli aggression</strong></a><br><p>

According to Station House Officer (SHO) Syed Khurshid Ali, a complaint was filed and the victim’s statement was recorded, in which he alleged that he was sexually assaulted by his teacher and was injured.
“The complaint was registered by the victim’s uncle, and the suspect was arrested,” the SHO told Dawn.com.
“A first information report will be lodged under Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the CPA (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection Act), and a medical report will be obtained,” he added. “However, the victim provided us with bloodstained clothes, which indicate that he was assaulted.”
The SHO said that further investigation was underway.

The Briton’s third victory of the season cut Australian Piastri’s Formula One lead from 22 to 15 points after 11 of 24 rounds, with the two McLaren drivers locked in an increasingly private title battle.
Charles Leclerc completed the podium for Ferrari with teammate Lewis Hamilton fourth and George Russell, last year’s winner in Austria, fifth for Mercedes.
Red Bull’s four-time world champion Max Verstappen suffered his first retirement of the season, in his team’s home race, after a first-lap collision with Mercedes’s Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli.
The Dutch driver stayed third overall but is now 61 points behind Piastri in the championship standings.
“Tricky, hot, tiring,” said Norris after stepping out of the car at the finish of the 70-lap race on a sweltering Sunday. “A lot of stress but a lot of fun. A nice battle, so well done to Oscar.
“Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was tough, especially when he was in DRS (drag reduction range).” Piastri, who seized second place from Leclerc after an aborted first start, set the fastest lap of the race.
He took the lead momentarily on lap 11 in an intense battle, but Norris grabbed it straight back in a duel that risked a repeat of the collision between the pair at the previous race in Canada.
Norris caused that one, and came away empty-handed, but this time it was Piastri who had the McLaren bosses shifting uneasily on the pitwall when he locked up with a puff of smoke on lap 20 while seeking to sneak through on the inside.
New Zealander Liam Lawson took a career-best finish in sixth for Racing Bulls with Fernando Alonso seventh for Aston Martin — the Spaniard finishing ahead of Sauber’s Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto.
The points were Bortoleto’s first in F1 and to make it even sweeter, Sauber took a double points finish, with Nico Hulkenberg finishing ninth. Hulkenberg was the first Sauber driver since Valtteri Bottas in 2022 to score in three races in a row.
Esteban Ocon took the final point for Haas.
McLaren are 207 points clear of Ferrari, who moved back up to second in the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who had to return home for personal reasons, in the constructors’ championship.</p><small>2025-06-29 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611564-pm-shehbaz-chaudhry-nisar-discuss-countrys-political-situation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Chaudhry Nisar discuss country's political situation</strong></a><br><p>

Trump made the remarks in an interview on Fox News programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’ and said that the deal he is developing would probably need China’s approval to move forward, predicting that Chinese President Xi Jinping would likely approve it.
The US president earlier this month extended a deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok to September 17, despite a law that mandated a sale or shutdown without significant progress.
A deal had been in the works this spring that would have spun off TikTok’s US operations into a new US-based firm — majority-owned and operated by US investors — but it was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,” Trump said. “I think I’ll need probably China’s approval. I think President Xi will probably do it.”
 


A 2024 US law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19, unless ByteDance had completed divesting the app’s US assets or demonstrated significant progress toward a sale.
Trump, who credits the app with boosting his support among young voters in last November’s presidential election, has extended the deadline three times.</p><small>2025-06-29 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2920205119a74a3.jpg?r=202340' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921023/strike-shuts-down-bangladeshs-biggest-port' target='_blank'><strong>Strike shuts down Bangladesh’s biggest port</strong></a><br><p>Operations at Bangladesh’s biggest port were suspended on Sunday as a strike by customs officials brought shipping activity to a halt.
The shutdown at Chittagong Port is part of an ongoing dispute between tax authority employees and the government, which is trying to overhaul the body.
“The port typically handles around 7,000 to 8,000 containers daily … But since this morning, there has been no movement in offloading or onboarding of goods,” said Mohammed Omar Faruq, secretary of the Chittagong Port Authority.
“This is having a huge impact on the country’s economic situation,” he told
AFP.
Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment manufacturer, while textile and garment production accounts for about 80 per cent of the country’s exports.
Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the halt in port operations would cost the industry $222 million.
“The cost of recovery will be staggering — beyond comprehension — and many factories risk going bankrupt,” he told AFP.
Staff at the National Board of Revenue (NBR) have been striking on and off for weeks over plans to split the authority into two separate bodies.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, urged them to end the walkout.
“We hope NBR’s staff will report back to work, setting aside their unlawful programme that goes against the national interest of the country,” his office said in a statement. “Otherwise, for the sake of the people of this country and safeguarding the economy, the government will be left with no option but to act firmly.”
NBR staff were prevented from entering their offices on Sunday after a government order sought to stop them from protesting within their building premises.
Meanwhile, 13 business chambers held a press conference on Saturday, urging the government to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p><small>2025-06-29 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611557-more-rains-thundershowers-predicted-from-july-28-31' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues urban flood warning as more rains, thundershowers predicted</strong></a><br><p>

The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
Shahid Khan, a spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, told Dawn.com that the head of the Shahab Khel peace committee was heading to Qabol Khel when he was attacked in the Kara Wanda area.
“The peace committee chief Ghulam Dastagir alias Fauji and his friends Saleem Khan and Salahuddin were killed,” Shahid told Dawn.com. “A search operation was launched in the area after the incident.”
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted in the past by terrorists. In April, there were two incidents targeting peace committees, one of which was in Lakki Marwat.
On April 29, a fierce gun battle was reported between members of a local peace committee and suspects — who allegedly killed an elderly man and wounded his relatives — in the district’s Begukhel area.
Earlier in April, a blast at a peace committee office in the South Waziristan district on Monday killed at least seven people, police and health officials said.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on April 26.
“Five of the injured were in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition was not critical”.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29181921ecf7bea.jpg?r=182049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921016/50pc-increase-in-fixed-gas-charges-notified-for-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>50pc increase in fixed gas charges notified for domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>The government on Sunday notified a 50 per cent increase in fixed gas charges for domestic consumers, according to a notification from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
On Friday, the federal cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1. The ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift the partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
According to the Ogra notification,  seen by Dawn.com, fixed charges for domestic consumers in the Protected category have risen to Rs600 from Rs400, while those in the non-protected category have to pay Rs1,500 as opposed to the previous charge of Rs1,000.
For non-protected consumers exceeding consumption of 1.5 cubic hectometres (hm³), the price has risen to Rs3,000 from Rs2,000.
Though the fixed charges have been increased, the price of gas itself has not risen, according to the notification. The sale prices for both Protected and Non-protected consumers remain the same. Additionally, gas prices for tandoors, commercial units, compressed natural gas and ice factories remain unchanged.
However, gas prices for general industries, power stations and independent power producers have risen.
Last month, Ogra determined about 6.6pc (Rs117 per unit) increase in prescribed natural gas prices to meet about Rs890 billion revenue requirement of the two gas companies during 2025-26.
In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.</p><small>2025-06-29 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611543-at-least-20-dead-in-kp-rains-as-crackdown-on-illegal-riverbed-hotels-launched-after-swat-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Crackdown initiated against Swat's illegal riverbed hotels as 20 dead in KP rains</strong></a><br><p>
