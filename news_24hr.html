Since being sworn in again in January, President Donald Trump has targeted top US universities over claims they are politically biased towards anti-Jewish hate and “woke” politics.
Trump has waged a political and economic campaign against Harvard, stripping it of funds and demanding extensive records linked to foreign students, whom it has repeatedly attempted to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting.
“After many previous requests to hand over relevant information concerning foreign students, DHS will now send subpoenas forcing Harvard to comply,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement.
Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “Harvard, like other universities, has allowed foreign students to abuse their visa privileges and advocate for violence and terrorism on campus.”
The subpoena demands that Harvard turn over “relevant records, communications, and other documents relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws since January 1, 2020,” according to the statement.
Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
Harvard, like several other universities, was swept by a wave of student protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Trump has made the question of student protests, particularly by foreign scholars, a flashpoint political issue.
A proclamation issued by the White House last month sought to bar most new international students at Harvard from entering the country, and said existing foreign enrollees risked having their visas terminated. Harvard challenged the move in court and a judge blocked the administration from enforcing the policy.
International students at Harvard, who accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment in the 2024-2025 academic year, are a major source of income for the Ivy League institution.
The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts, institution from any future federal funding.
Harvard has been at the forefront of Trump’s campaign against top universities after it defied his calls to submit to oversight of its curriculum, staffing, student recruitment and “viewpoint diversity.”
Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including New York’s Columbia University — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09210755c5a0641.jpg?r=210819' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923080/nepra-announces-rs403-per-unit-refund-for-k-electric-consumers-in-july-bills' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra announces Rs4.03 per unit refund for K-Electric consumers in July bills</strong></a><br><p>The National Elec­t­ric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs4.03 per unit for K-Electric (KE) consumers in July’s bills for power consumed in April.
According to a notification issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of 4.0349/kWh for April 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of July 2025”.
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.
The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.
“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.
It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April in the billing month of July.
The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs.4.0349/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.
Separately, Nepra also notified a Rs0.49 per unit negative FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for May in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).
According to a separate notification issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform decrease of Rs.0.4952/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for May”.
The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.
“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of May 2025 in the billing month of July 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in May.
“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09195207073ca35.jpg?r=205345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923078/russia-launches-largest-drone-strike-of-war-with-ukraine-after-trump-vows-to-send-more-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>Russia launches largest drone strike of war with Ukraine after Trump vows to send more weapons</strong></a><br><p>Russia targeted Ukraine with a record 728 drones overnight, shortly after US President Donald Trump pledged to send more defensive weapons to Kyiv and aimed unusually direct criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ukrainian air defence units destroyed almost all the drones, including through electronic jamming systems, Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging app.
The attack, which follows a series of escalating air assaults on Ukraine in recent weeks, showed the need for “biting” sanctions on the sources of income Russia uses to finance the war, including on those who buy Russian oil, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram.
Trump said on Tuesday he was considering supporting a bill in the Senate that would impose steep sanctions on Russia, including 500 per cent tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports.
“We get a lot of ‘b******t’ thrown at us by Putin … He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting.
When asked by a reporter what action he would take against Putin, Trump said: “I wouldn’t tell you. We want to have a little surprise.” Separately, Europe is working on a new sanctions package against Moscow.
 


Trump, who returned to power this year promising a swift end to the war in Ukraine, has shifted US rhetoric away from staunch support for Kyiv towards accepting some of Moscow’s justifications for its full-scale invasion.
But initial rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine have so far borne little fruit, with Moscow yet to accept an unconditional ceasefire proposed by Trump and accepted by Kyiv.
The US president’s promise to supply more defensive weapons reversed a Pentagon decision days earlier to stall some critical munitions supplies to Ukraine, despite rising Russian attacks that spread fear in Kyiv.
Following Trump’s new promise, Zelensky said on Tuesday he had ordered an expansion of contacts with the United States to ensure critical deliveries of military supplies, primarily air defence.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is due in Rome later on Wednesday to attend a July 10-11 international aid conference on Ukraine, attended by Zelensky and Kyiv’s European allies.
ECHR finds Russia responsible for ‘rights abuses’, downing of MH17
Europe’s top human rights court ruled unanimously on Wednesday that Russia was responsible for the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 and also that Moscow had repeatedly and systematically violated human rights in Ukraine.
The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said Russia had performed indiscriminate military attacks, summary executions of civilians, torture including the use of rape as a weapon of war, unjustified displacement and transfer of civilians and other violations.
Ahead of Wednesday’s ruling, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not abide by any court decisions, saying: “We consider them null and void.”

The ECHR is an international court of the Council of Europe, also based in Strasbourg, from which Russia was expelled in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s parliament then voted in 2023 to end the ECHR’s jurisdiction in the country.
In its ruling, the ECHR said: “Taken as a whole, the vast volume of evidence before the court presented a picture of interconnected practices of manifestly unlawful conduct by agents of the Russian State (Russian armed forces and other authorities, occupying administrations, and separatist armed groups and entities) on a massive scale across Ukraine.”
The ruling concerned four consolidated cases, one of which involved Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which departed Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur in July 2014 and was shot down over eastern Ukraine amid fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. All 298 people on board the plane died.
Moscow denies any responsibility for MH17’s downing and in 2014 denied any presence in Ukraine.

‘Suffering and grief’
The ECHR ruled that Russia had failed to conduct an adequate investigation into the incident, to cooperate with requests for information or provide legal remedies for survivors. Its lack of cooperation and continued denial of any involvement has caused additional suffering for the victims’ relatives, the court said.
Responding to the ruling, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said: “Nothing can take away this suffering and grief, but I hope the verdict offers a sense of justice and recognition.” A majority of those on the airliner were Dutch.
The other three cases covered by Wednesday’s ruling were brought by Ukraine, over pro-Russian separatists accused of abducting groups of Ukrainian children and transferring them to Russia, and over alleged patterns of human rights violations during Russia’s war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.
Ukraine’s Justice Ministry, in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, hailed the ECHR ruling as “one of the most important in the practice of interstate cases”.
The court is expected to rule in due course on possible damages and compensation but it has no way of enforcing its rulings, especially on a country that no longer recognises its jurisdiction, meaning Wednesday’s verdict is mainly symbolic.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0918480773594ae.jpg?r=185007' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923067/hrcp-expresses-concern-as-govt-warns-criminal-action-against-27-youtube-channels-set-for-blocking' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern as govt warns criminal action against 27 YouTube channels set for blocking</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday expressed concern over the recent court decision banning 27 YouTube channels as the government said the owners were expected to face criminal action.
It emerged a day ago that an Islamabad court last month ordered YouTube to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces.
Among the 27 sanctioned accounts — run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas — are those of the PTI, Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor, Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.
In a statement on X, HRCP said that it was “greatly concerned” by the court’s directive.
“The wholesale blocking of entire channels — rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process — conflates dissent with criminal activity,” the statement said.
“The constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,” the HRCP said, urging “precise and proportionate” interventions against hate speech.
 






Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that these channels would also face criminal action.
Speaking to the media earlier today, he said, “The whole world, including Pakistan, has laws regulating cybercrime and cybersecurity. Those laws must be followed.” He added, “You cannot use [your] mobile and social media to spread anarchy.”
YouTube told the 27 content creators that their channels could be taken down if they did not comply with the court orders.
“If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice,” the popular video sharing platform said in emails this week to the channel owners, according to a notice seen by Reuters.
Toor, who has more than 333,000 YouTube subscribers, said the move was aimed at undermining fundamental and constitutional rights of the people, political parties and other dissident groups.
“It is not about me. It is about these people who are on the left side of the state,” he told Reuters.
“I have dedicated my platform for these underdogs who have no place to go to and raise their voices against state oppression.”
 
 

YouTube’s regional communications manager did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Digital rights campaigners say that any ban would further undermine free speech in the country and accuse the authorities of stifling newspapers and television, with social media seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.
Digital rights activist Usama Khilji said the court did not fulfil due process.
“What is jarring is the complete lack of legal process,” he said.
Toor said neither the court nor the cybercrime agency gave him a chance to respond to the allegations, and that he would be taking legal action against the court order.
“It is a dictatorial move. It can’t silence me,” he said
On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lifted the ban on X in May after the platform was inaccessible to users for more than a year.
The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.
In April 2024, the interior ministry told the Islamabad High Court that X didn’t adhere to the government’s directives to stop the “misuse of its platform”. The ban was imposed “in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation”.
Migration to YouTube
After the government clamped down on traditional media, many independent-minded reporters migrated to YouTube, as did journalists and commentators sympathetic to former prime minister Imran Khan, who was removed from office in 2022.
“It’s not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned. It’s what they are not allowing to be told and the human rights abuse they are trying to hide from the world,” said PTI leader Zulfikar Bukhari.
“In this day and age you can’t suppress digital media,” he added.
The order is the latest in a series of laws and regulations from the government that have enabled the authorities to crack down on critics and dissidents. It has blocked social media platforms X, Facebook and TikTok on several occasions.
In January, parliament introduced a new amendment in the Electronic Crimes Act to further regulate cyber content, which included a new social media regulatory authority with its own investigation agency and tribunals.
Such tribunals will be able to try and punish alleged offenders with prison sentences of as long as three years and fines of two million rupees for dissemination of information deemed “false or fake”.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613219-pakistan-never-backs-terrorists-bilawal-tells-indias-karan-thapar-clearly' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan never backs terrorists, Bilawal tells India's Karan Thapar clearly</strong></a><br><p>

In his letter to the Nobel Committee, which he shared online, Netanyahu said Trump had “demonstrated steadfast and exceptional dedication to promoting peace, security and stability around the world”.
Trump, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, has been nominated before. Pakistan said in June it would recommend Trump for the prize for his work in helping to resolve the conflict with India.
Netanyahu’s nomination of Trump has generated scepticism in some quarters, including from former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, who said on X that Netanyahu was seeking to flatter Trump.
 






If Trump won the prize, he would be the fifth US president to do so, after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
Here is a look at how the award works:
Who is eligible to win?
According to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, the prize should go to the person “who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses”.
All living persons or active institutions are eligible.
In an introduction on the Nobel website, Chair of the Peace Prize Committee Jorgen Watne Frydnes says, “In practice, anyone can be the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. The history of the prize shows clearly it’s given to people from all layers of society from all over the world.”
The Nobel Prizes are announced in October each year, but nominations close the previous January, meaning Netanyahu’s nomination of Trump could not be considered this year.
Who can nominate?
Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law, and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others. You cannot nominate yourself.
Nominee lists are kept secret for 50 years, though there is nothing to stop those who make nominations from disclosing their choices.
Who decides the winner?
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian parliament, is the arbiter. Members are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by the head of the Norwegian branch of PEN International, a group defending freedom of expression.
They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in Norway’s parliament.
How does the committee decide the winner?
The first meeting of the committee takes place in February of each year, when committee members can make their own nominations to add to the list.
Last year, there were 286 nominees, and in 2025, there are 338 candidates nominated for the prize — 244 individuals and 94 organisations.
The committee whittles the nominations down to make a shortlist, and each nominee is then assessed by a group of permanent advisers and other experts.
The committee aims for unanimity but can decide by majority vote. A final decision is often only made a few days before the prize is announced.
Controversies
The Nobel Peace Prize has often been seen as having a political message. The Nobel website says some recipients have been “highly controversial political actors”, while the prize has also increased public focus on international or national conflicts.
Obama won the award just a few months after taking office. Two members of the committee stepped down over the decision in 1973 to award the Peace Prize to US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho for negotiating an end to the Vietnam War.
One member quit in 1994 when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel’s Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.
What does the Laureate get?
A medal, a diploma, 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.15m) and immediate global attention, if they are not already famous.
When are the announcement and the ceremony?
The announcement of this year’s prize will be made on October 10 at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.
The ceremony will take place at the Oslo City Hall on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09183814f1aee65.jpg?r=191347' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923071/bangladesh-recordings-suggest-ex-pm-hasina-ordered-deadly-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh recordings suggest ex-PM Hasina ordered deadly crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Audio recordings analysed by the BBC suggest Bangladesh’s fugitive ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina ordered a deadly crackdown on protests last year, allegations for which she is on trial.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.
Hasina, 77, fled to India at the culmination of the student-led uprising and has defied orders to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia for charges amounting to crimes against humanity opened on June 1.
The BBC Eye Investigations team analysed audio alleged to be of Hasina — and which forms a key plank of the evidence for the prosecution — which was leaked online.
In the recording, dated July 18, 2024, a voice alleged to be Hasina is heard authorising security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters and that “wherever they find [them], they will shoot”.
The BBC said audio forensics experts had found no evidence that the speech had been edited or manipulated, and that it was “highly unlikely to have been synthetically generated”.
Bangladesh police have also matched the audio with verified recordings of Hasina.
‘Denies the charges’
Protests began on July 1, 2024, with university students calling for reforms to a quota system for public sector jobs.
Student ambitions to topple Hasina’s iron-fisted rule seemed a fantasy, just months after she won her fourth consecutive election in a vote without genuine opposition.
But protests gathered pace and a fuse was lit when police launched a deadly crackdown on July 16.
Hasina’s state-appointed lawyer — who says they have not been in contact with her — has sought to throw out the charges.
Her now-banned Awami League party said it “categorically denies the charges that its senior leaders, and the prime minister personally, directed the use of lethal force against crowds during the protests of last summer”.
It instead said that “breakdowns in discipline among some members of the security forces on the ground in response to instances of violence led to (a) regrettable loss of life”.
Hasina was already convicted of contempt of court in a separate case on July 2, receiving a six-month sentence. She remains in India.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0914232570c2fdb.jpg?r=183330' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923046/musks-ai-firm-deletes-grok-posts-after-anti-semitism-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s AI firm deletes Grok posts after anti-Semitism criticism</strong></a><br><p>Billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup on Wednesday removed posts made by its chatbot Grok on X after it came under fire for anti-Semitic content.
Concerns over political bias, hate speech and factual inaccuracy in AI chatbots have mounted since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022.
“We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” said a post attributed to the AI system on Musk’s social media platform X, where the bot can be accessed.
“Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.”
 






The firm said xAI was training the bot for “only truth-seeking” and thanked its users for helping the company identify the inappropriate posts.
Screenshots posted on X showed several posts made by the bot in which it praised Adolf Hitler, and claimed Jews promoted “anti-white hate”.
 






The chatbot, developed by Musk’s company xAI, was criticised by Jewish activist group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for answering multiple user prompts with the questionable posts.
“What we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and anti-Semitic, plain and simple,” the ADL said on X.
“This supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the anti-Semitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.”
 






Musk has not commented on the controversy, but posted: “Never a dull moment on this platform.”
Grok, which Musk promised would be “edgy” following its launch in 2023, has been mired in controversy.
In May, it caused a row for generating misleading and unsolicited posts referencing “white genocide” in South Africa, which xAI blamed on an “unauthorised modification”.
Turkiye blocks Grok content for alleged insults to Erdogan, religious values
Separately, a Turkish court on Wednesday blocked access to some content from Grok after authorities said the chatbot generated responses insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, modern Turkiye’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and religious values.
Ankara chief prosecutor’s office said it launched an investigation, and marked Turkiye’s first such ban on content from an AI tool.
Authorities cited violations of laws that make such insults a criminal offence punishable by up to four years in prison.
Neither X, nor its owner Elon Musk could immediately be reached for comment. They have not referred to the decision on the platform.
 
 

Last month, Musk promised an upgrade to Grok, suggesting there was “far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data”.
Grok, which is integrated into X, reportedly generated offensive content about Erdogan and Ataturk when asked certain questions in Turkish, media said.
The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) adopted the ban after the court order.
Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu was later cited by broadcaster NTV as saying that Turkiye had not yet imposed a total access ban on Grok but that it would do so if necessary, adding Turkish authorities would discuss the issue with X.
Yaman Akdeniz, a cyber law expert at Istanbul Bilgi University, said authorities had identified some 50 posts by Grok as the basis for the investigation, ruling on the access ban and removal of certain content to “protect public order”.
“Turkiye has become the first country to impose censorship on Grok,” he said on X.
 






Turkiye has in recent years significantly increased oversight on social media platforms and online streaming services, passing laws to give authorities more control over content, detaining or arresting individuals for posts, launching probes into companies and limiting or blocking access to certain sites.
Critics say the law is frequently used to stifle dissent, while the government maintains it is necessary to protect the dignity of the office.

The State Bank of Pakistan said remittances reached $38.3bn during July-June 2024-25, as compared to the $30.3bn in remittances received during the same period for FY2023-24.
Similarly, on a year-by-year basis, the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.
 






Data showed that Saudi Arabia ($823.2m) and the United Arab Emirates ($717.2m) were the biggest sources of remittance inflows during June 2025, followed by the United Kingdom ($537.6m) and the United States ($281.2m).
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier was pleased at the development, saying that the government was committed to economic prosperity after bringing economic stability, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“The record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis’ valuable contributions and their confidence in the national economy,” he added.
He expressed the opinion that the recent positive economic indicators were a “manifestation of the government’s policies in the right direction”.
Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad termed the record remittances “massive” in a post on X and added that the feat “reflects growing trust of overseas Pakistanis in the economy and policy measures”.
 






A study published by the Asian Development Bank last year found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home, and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.</p><small>2025-07-09 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09174137949f0c2.jpg?r=184046' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923062/toll-of-air-india-disaster-rests-at-260-as-focus-turns-to-crash-report' target='_blank'><strong>Toll of Air India disaster rests at 260 as focus turns to crash report</strong></a><br><p>Indian forensic investigators have identified all 260 people killed in last month’s crash of a London-bound passenger plane, health authorities said on Wednesday, ahead of a hugely anticipated preliminary report into what went wrong.
India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the probe into one of the deadliest air disasters in decades, with an initial report expected on Friday.
All but one of the 242 people aboard the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were killed when it crashed on June 12.
It ploughed into housing just after takeoff in the western city of Ahmedabad, and authorities have also identified 19 people killed on the ground.
No details have been released about the probe, in which British and US air accident investigation agencies have also taken part.
But specialist website The Air Current, citing multiple sources familiar with the investigation, reported it had “narrowed its focus to the movement of the engine fuel switches”, while noting that full analysis will “take months — if not longer”.
 
 

It added that “the focus of the investigators could change during that time”.
But “at this point in the inquiry, the data available to investigators does not indicate a mechanical or design issue” with the 787 plane, or its engines.
The site said its sources “indicated that post-accident analysis showed no sign of fuel contamination or improper retraction of the aircraft’s flaps”, over which there had been speculation.
Matched all DNA
Health officials in the Indian state of Gujarat initially said at least 279 people were killed, but forensic scientists reduced the figure after multiple scattered and badly burnt remains were identified.
“The final death toll in the plane crash now stands at 260,” Rakesh Joshi, head of Ahmedabad’s main state hospital, told AFP today.
“All the human remains found so far from the crash site have been identified and handed over to their families,” Joshi added.
“Our work is now over,” he added. “We have matched DNA of all the mortal remains that were collected from the crash site.”
The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) stipulates that states heading an investigation must submit a preliminary report within 30 days of an accident. That report, however, does not have to be made public.
According to the ICAO, preliminary reports “may be marked as confidential or remain public at the investigating state’s discretion”.
Joshi said it was doubtful any further remains would be found in the wreckage. “The possibility is almost negligible, I believe,” he said.
On Tuesday, health authorities handed over the remains of 26 victims to their relatives, or, for families who had already received parts of their dead kin’s bodies and held funerals, carried out ceremonies for them.
“Seven families collected the remains of their kin … while 19 families gave consent to the hospital to carry out the rites,” Joshi said.
There were 230 passengers — 169 Indians, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian — along with 12 crew members.
Dozens of people were injured, with two remaining in the hospital.
Only one passenger miraculously survived, a British citizen who was seen walking out of the wreckage of the crash, and who has since been discharged from the hospital.</p><small>2025-07-09 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09175814f033560.jpg?r=175827' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923064/sbp-to-launch-pilot-for-digital-currency-says-governor' target='_blank'><strong>SBP to launch pilot for digital currency, says governor</strong></a><br><p>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday the institution plans to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramps up efforts to modernise the country’s financial system.
Central banks globally are exploring the use of digital currencies as interest in blockchain-based payments grows. Pakistan’s move follows similar steps by regulators in China, India, Nigeria and several Gulf states to test or issue digital currencies through controlled pilot programmes.
At the Reuters NEXT Asia summit in Singapore, Ahmad said Pakistan was “building up our capacity on the central bank digital currency” and hoped to roll out a pilot soon.
He was speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka’s central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with both discussing monetary policy challenges in South Asia.
Ahmad said a new law would “lay down the foundations for the licensing and regulation” of the virtual assets sector and that the central bank was in touch with some tech partners.
The move builds on efforts by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), set up in March by the government to drive virtual asset adoption.
Bilal bin Saqib, PCC chief executive officer and state minister on blockchain and crypto, said in a statement today that the government had approved the  Virtual Assets Act 2025, creating an independent regulator to license and oversee the crypto sector.
The PCC is exploring bitcoin mining using surplus energy, has appointed Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and plans to establish a state-run Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
 
 

It has also held talks with US-based crypto firms, including the World Liberty Financial linked to US President Donald Trump.
In May, the SBP clarified that virtual assets were not illegal. However, it advised financial institutions not to engage with them until a formal licensing framework was in place.
“There are risks associated, and at the same time, there are opportunities in this new emerging field. So we have to evaluate and manage the risk very carefully, and at the same time not allow to let go of the opportunity,” he said on the panel.
Tight grip, falling interest rates
Ahmad said the SBP would continue to maintain a tight policy stance to stabilise inflation within its 5–7 per cent medium-term target.
Pakistan has cut its benchmark rate from a peak of 22pc to 11pc over the past year, as inflation slumped from 38pc in May 2023 to 3.2pc in June, averaging 4.5pc in the 2025 fiscal year just ended, a nine-year low.
“We are now seeing the results of this tight monetary policy transfer, both on our inflation as well as on the external account,” he said.
 
 

Ahmad said Pakistan was not overly exposed to dollar weakness, noting its foreign debt was mostly dollar-denominated and only 13pc comprised Eurobonds or commercial loans.
“We don’t see any major impact,” he said, adding that reserves had risen to $14.5 billion from under $3bn two years ago.
Ahmad said Pakistan’s three-year $7bn IMF programme, which runs through September 2027, was on track and had resulted in reforms in fiscal policy, energy pricing and the foreign exchange market.
“We are confident that after that [IMF programme], maybe we will not require an immediate [follow-up].”
Asked whether Pakistan had financing plans lined up for upcoming military equipment purchases, particularly imports from China, the SBP governor said he was not aware of such plans.
Govt approves Virtual Assets Act 2025
Earlier today, the government formally approved the Virtual Assets Act, 2025, following endorsements from the federal cabinet, the prime minister and the president, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The law establishes the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA), an autonomous federal body empowered to licence, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets, according to a press release issued by the office of the special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency.
The authority has been granted comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, financial integrity, and the prevention of illicit activities, in alignment with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force.
The board of the authority will include key government stakeholders, such as the SBP governor, secretaries of finance, law and justice, and information technology and telecommunications, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Digital Pakistan Authority.
Additionally, two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance, or technology will be appointed by the federal government. The chairperson, appointed on the basis of demonstrated experience in finance, law, technology, or regulatory affairs, will oversee the authority’s functions.
Under the act, any person or company intending to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by the authority. A structured licensing regime will be introduced, with specific requirements for incorporation, operational capacity, compliance frameworks and reporting obligations.
The legislation also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight. In addition, the authority may issue no-action relief letters under defined conditions to facilitate experimentation while preserving regulatory accountability.
To ensure compatibility with Islamic finance principles, the law mandates the formation of a shariah advisory committee, which will advise the authority on matters related to the shariah compliance of virtual asset products and services.
Licensed entities offering Islamic financial products will be bound by the rulings issued by the committee.
The act also provides for the establishment of a virtual assets appellate tribunal to hear appeals against regulatory decisions. The tribunal will function with judicial independence and a specialised bench comprising experts in law, finance, and technology.
“With this forward-looking legislation, Pakistan takes a major step in shaping a secure, inclusive and innovation-friendly digital financial ecosystem, ensuring that technological progress is matched with institutional readiness and public interest safeguards,” APP said.</p><small>2025-07-09 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09180939f76d8f6.jpg?r=182223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923068/red-bull-sacks-christian-horner-after-20-years-as-f1-team-boss' target='_blank'><strong>Red Bull sacks Christian Horner after 20 years as F1 team boss</strong></a><br><p>Christian Horner was sacked on Wednesday by Red Bull after 20 years as team principal of the Formula One outfit.
The 51-year-old has been in charge since the team was formed in 2005 and has led them to eight drivers’ titles and six constructors’ crowns.
Dutchman Max Verstappen has won the past four drivers’ titles for Red Bull, matching the achievement of Sebastian Vettel, who dominated for the team from 2010 to 2013.
Horner’s dismissal as CEO and team principal comes 17 months after he was accused by a female colleague of “inappropriate behaviour”.
The Englishman was twice cleared over the claims by the Formula One team’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH, and his wife, former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, stood by him.
But there have been rumblings of discontent within the team, with several high-profile departures, while form on the track has nose-dived.
“Red Bull has released Christian Horner from his operational duties with effect from today (Wednesday) and has appointed Laurent Mekies as CEO of Red Bull Racing,” said a statement from Red Bull GmbH.
Oliver Mintzlaff, CEO of corporate projects and investments, paid tribute to Horner, thanking him for his “exceptional work”.
“With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1,” he said.
“Thank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.”
‘Difficult to drive’
Horner’s departure comes amid speculation that Verstappen may be tempted to jump ship to Mercedes.
Although the 27-year-old Dutchman won the title last year, he only topped the podium twice in the final 14 races of the season.
Red Bull has won only two races this season, with McLaren taking their place as the team to beat. Verstappen is languishing 69 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri at the halfway point of the campaign and finished a disappointing fifth at Sunday’s British Grand Prix, having started on pole.
He showed frustration with his Red Bull during the race, saying: “This car is just so difficult to drive.”
Other key figures responsible for the team’s previous dominance have left since last year, including design guru Adrian Newey, who signed for Aston Martin, and sporting director Jonathan Wheatley, who joined Sauber.
Max Verstappen’s father, Jos, a former F1 driver, had expressed his dissatisfaction with Horner even after he was cleared of the charges of inappropriate behaviour. He warned the team was in danger of being “torn apart” if Horner remained.
Mekies, who has been promoted from Red Bull’s second team, Racing Bulls, has had a long career in Formula One, previously working as racing director for Ferrari.
“The last year and a half has been an absolute privilege to lead the team with Peter (Bayer),” the 48-year-old Frenchman said in a statement. “It has been an amazing adventure to contribute to the birth of Racing Bulls together with all our talented people.
“The spirit of the whole team is incredible, and I strongly believe that this is just the beginning.”</p><small>2025-07-09 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0918114861ccb85.jpg?r=181155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR brands Indian NSA Ajit Doval ‘chief architect’ of terrorism in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Wednesday accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of being the “chief architect” of terrorism in Pakistan.
The interview comes amid tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s baseless allegations against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
During an exclusive interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera, the military’s spokesperson branded Doval the “evil chief architect of India’s terror enterprise” and accused him of being responsible for not only acts of terrorism in Pakistan, but also terrorism within the region and transnational killings.
“Do you think it’s happening on its own? This terror enterprise cannot be sustained without the sponsorship of India,” the DG ISPR said. “Who is the chief architect? Mr Ajit Doval.”
According to the ISPR chief, India provided funding, planning, intelligence and technical support to terrorist groups within Pakistan, such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan.
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The strategy of India is to keep Pakistan embroiled in this menace of terrorism, so that its true power … potential is not realised,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The power differential between the two countries keeps increasing, so that India can act as a regional hegemon, a bully and can dictate its own terms.”
He added that this strategy of supporting terrorists in the region went as far back as 1971, when India supported the Mukti Bahini in East Pakistan.
“Indians have acknowledged it — PM [Narendra] Modi went on record not only acknowledging but boasting about it.”
 


The military’s spokesperson then added that terrorist commanders who had surrendered or been captured confessed that they received support from New Delhi, citing press conferences by captured Fitna-al-Hindustan commanders and the case of captured Indian Navy Officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.
“This evidence is all public. It is RAW,” he said, referring to India’s spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing.
“And not only are they using men, they are also exploiting the Baloch women for these nefarious purposes.”
‘A reckless and irresponsible state’
Lt Gen Chaudhry further said that Pakistan was “not a reckless and irresponsible state like India”, blaming external actors for internal issues.
“We must understand that terrorism is an internal problem of India as a result of the continuous oppression which India does to its minorities as part of its policy,” he said. “Rather than addressing these grave injustices, inequalities, and doing soul searching, it (India) is very quick to put all the blame on Pakistan.
“Because of this senseless blame game that the Indians are resorting to, it is bringing the thresholds between India and Pakistan to dangerously low levels, to such levels that where one incident of terrorism or an act of violence can be turned into an act of war.”
The ISPR chief warned that such an approach was putting the lives of over 1.6 billion people “in the hands of non-state actors” who had an interest in Pakistan and India going to war.
“We are an established and declared nuclear power, and the world has no experience of going to or even attempting to go into a misadventure against an established nuclear power,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
“If such a misadventure is taken or attempted, then it will lead to horrific consequences which the world may not be able to endure.”</p><small>2025-07-09 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091616034d61286.jpg?r=171951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923012/pakistan-turkiye-to-establish-special-economic-zone-for-turkish-entrepreneurs-in-karachi-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye to establish special economic zone for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.
The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.
Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Islamabad.
“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).
 


Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”
The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.
“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.
Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the Jinnah Medical Complex and Daanish University megaprojects in Islamabad.
The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.
“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.
He appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”
In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Fidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and arrested a high-ranking terrorist.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, Radio Pakistan stated.
He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.
Fidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, Radio Pakistan added.
Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.
’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.
 






Air chief, Turkish defence minister agree to form joint working groups
Separately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.
Both officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.
 


The Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.
He lauded PAF’s “exceptional performance under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.
“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
Guler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.
The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.
During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.
 
 

He reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.
“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.
The military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.
Dar, Fidan co-chair first meeting of joint commission
Meanwhile, Dar and Fidan co-chaired the first meeting of a joint commission established in February during President Erdogan’s visit, the FO said in a statement.
Dar expressed satisfaction with the progress of all 12 Joint Standing Committees (JSCs) working under the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) framework, saying they have “either already met or are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks”.
 






Established in 2009, HLSCC is the highest decision-making forum bet­ween the two countries, guiding bilateral relations through joint standing committees covering trade, investment, defen­­ce, energy, agriculture, IT, health and education.
During the press briefing, Dar said that the JSC on security, defence and intelligence was scheduled to meet on July 24 in Islamabad, while the committee on transport and communication was expected to meet next week.
The trade and investment JSC met on June 20, Dar noted, adding that the committee on defence industries was scheduled to meet later in September.
“Similarly, other committees — health, science and technology; social sector development; culture and tourism; agriculture and water; energy and power; banking and finance; and the political and diplomatic coordination committee are expected to meet in the coming months,” he said.
The upcoming meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), co-chaired by Güler and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, is also expected to be held next week, FO said.
“This important platform is expected to further bolster economic cooperation between the two countries,” it highlighted.
The FO added that both sides exchanged views on a range of regional and global developments, and reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace.
Turkish ministers land in Pakistan
A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Islamabad in May last year.
Fidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said on X.
 






“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the FO said. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”
It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.
 






On Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.
Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.
The two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.

The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered at Rawat Police Station a day ago on the complaint of Head Constable Shahbaz Anjum Kayani under Section 302 (Punishment of qatl-i-amd), and Section 311 (Waiver or compounding of qisas) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Under Section 311, the state becomes the complainant, as this provision is non-compoundable, and the case must proceed to a logical conclusion. The punishment for ‘honour’ killings, under Sections 311 and 302, includes the death sentence or life imprisonment. The option for a 25-year sentence under Section 302C is not applicable when Section 311 is invoked.
The FIR said the incident occurred at 11:30am a day ago in Dhok Chaudhrian, within the limits of the Rawat Police Station when Kayani received a tipoff from a source about the suspect asking his daughter to delete her TikTok account, but she refused. He added that the suspect was angered and shot his daughter in the name of ‘honour’, fleeing after the crime.
A statement from the police said they had arrested the victim’s father and recovered the murder weapon, a pistol, from his possession, adding that three teams were formed under the supervision of Saddar Superintendent of Police  Nabeel Khokhar for the task.
Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Mehmood Hamdani told Dawn.com that the “police registered the case as a complaint because the family of the deceased was portraying the incident as suicide. Later, police investigation revealed it was a murder. The police filed the case to avoid any compromise in future.
“Similar cases were registered earlier too, but when a family member becomes the complainant, they reach a compromise after six months or a year. Police registered the case as the complaintant to charge the suspect with solid evidence.”
The police further said that the postmortem analysis had been conducted, evidence was collected from the crime scene and investigations were ongoing from all angles.
 






“Crimes against women and children are intolerable; the accused will be prosecuted with solid evidence and ensured a just punishment,” the CPO said.
 






TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
Last month, popular social media influencer, Sana Yousuf, was shot dead at her house in Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media. The incident sparked public outrage and widespread media coverage. The case remains under investigation.
Cases of honour killings are prevalent in Pakistan. From January to November last year, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.
In January, a man who had recently brought his family back to Pakistan from the United States confessed to shooting dead his teenage daughter, motivated by his disappr­oval of her TikTok content.
In December, Amina Bibi, a mother of three, was shot dead by her brother, Zafar Hussain, in the Qasimpur area of Pakpattan. Hussain told the police he thought his sister had a “questionable character”.
In November, a mother of five was brutally killed in Faisalabad by her husband and younger brother, allegedly to protect the family’s ‘honour’. Accused of having an affair, the victim was attacked at home with bricks, leading to fatal injuries. Her body was later dumped in a nullah through a donkey cart.
A man murdered four women in his family in October, including his mother, in a fit of rage over their TikTok videos. He told the police the videos spread “immodesty and shamelessness, tarnishing the family’s reputation”.</p><small>2025-07-09 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613188-pakistan-turkiye-pledge-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-5bn' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye pledge to boost bilateral trade volume to $5bn</strong></a><br><p>

The study targeted the 10 days, ending July 2, during which large parts of Western Europe were hit by extreme heat, with temperatures breaching 40 degrees Celsius in Spain and wildfires breaking out in France.
Of the 2,300 people estimated to have died during this period, 1,500 deaths were linked to climate change, which made the heatwave more severe, according to the study conducted by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
“Climate change has made it significantly hotter than it would have been, which in turn makes it a lot more dangerous,” said Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London.
The study covered 12 cities, including Barcelona, Madrid, London and Milan, where the researchers said climate change had increased heatwave temperatures by up to 4°C.
The researchers used established epidemiological models and historical mortality data to estimate the death toll, which reflects deaths where heat was the underlying reason for mortality, including if exposure exacerbated pre-existing health conditions.
The scientists said they used peer-reviewed methods to quickly produce the estimated death toll because most heat-related deaths are not officially reported, and some governments do not release this data.
Last month was the planet’s third-hottest June on record, behind the same month in 2024 and 2023, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said in a monthly bulletin on Wednesday.
Western Europe experienced its warmest June on record, with much of the region experiencing “very strong heat stress” — defined by conditions that feel like a temperature of 38°C or more, Copernicus said.
Some estimate 50 metric tonnes of trash remain on the Mt Everest due to decades of climbing and lax regulations.
“In a warming world, heatwaves are likely to become more frequent, more intense and impact more people across Europe,” said Samantha Burgess, Copernicus’ strategic lead for climate.
Researchers from European health institutes reported in 2023 that as many as 61,000 people may have died in Europe’s sweltering heatwaves in 2022, according to new research, suggesting countries’ heat preparedness efforts are falling fatally short.
The build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere — which mostly come from the burning of fossil fuels — means the planet’s average temperature has increased over time.
This increase in baseline temperatures means that when a heatwave comes, temperatures can surge to higher peaks.</p><small>2025-07-09 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091404051e77a80.png?r=142113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923047/2-pilots-killed-as-indian-air-force-jaguar-jet-crashes-in-rajasthan' target='_blank'><strong>2 pilots killed as Indian Air Force Jaguar jet crashes in Rajasthan</strong></a><br><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) said two of its pilots were killed as a Jaguar fighter jet crashed near a village in Rajasthan’s Churu district on Wednesday.
“An IAF Jaguar Trainer aircraft met with an accident during a routine training mission and crashed near Churu in Rajasthan today. Both pilots sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” the IAF said in a post on X.
 






The statement added that no damage to any civilian property had been reported.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of lives and stands firmly with the bereaved families in this time of grief,” the statement read, adding that a court of inquiry had been constituted to determine the cause of the accident.
The aircraft was a Jaguar jet, originally a British-French-made aircraft, that crashed in an agricultural field at around 1:25pm, Rajaldesar Station House Officer Kamlesh told Press Trust of India.
Human body parts were found near the crash site, SHO Kamlesh had added.
 
 

An investigation and rescue operations are underway after authorities rushed to the scene, Hindustan Times reported.
The aircraft had taken off from the Suratgarh airbase with two pilots onboard, ANI News reported.
The Indian Express quoted Churu Superintendent of Police Jai Yadav as saying that the incident occurred at around 12:30pm.
Earlier in May, India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan confirmed in May that his country’s fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan during the four-day conflict earlier that month.
In April, the IAF had said it regretted the damage caused to the property near Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri district by the “inadvertent drop of a non-explosive aerial store” from an aircraft.
According to Indian media reports at the time, “a heavy metal object fell from the sky from an air force jet on the house of Manoj Sagar […] due to which two outer rooms have been damaged”.
In March of last year, a domestically made light combat IAF jet, called Tejas, crashed in Rajasthan, making it the first such incident since the aircraft was inducted in 2016.

The incident comes after reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com: “Two quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today. In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman’s children.”
The woman’s body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.
DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Maryan police station, damaging the station’s solar panels on the rooftop.
He said, “The police personnel remained safe in the attack,” adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.
“A search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,” he added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.
On Saturday, one person was killed and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.
In March, 16 terrorists were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a terrorist attack on the Bannu Cantonment.
The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after “severe destruction” of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p><small>2025-07-09 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613176-bully-india-using-transnational-killings-terror-cells-to-keep-pakistan-from-realising-its-true-potential-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>'Bully India' using transnational killings, terror cells to suppress Pakistan's progress: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In a high-visibility moment at the White House on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handed Trump a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing, among other things, Trump’s “decisive diplomacy” in resolving disputes.
This symbolic endorsement comes amid growing signs that the Trump administration is carefully shaping its South Asia message — amplifying its version of regional stability while deliberately avoiding any confrontation with India or with Pakistan’s current leadership.
The evolving narrative was further underscored at the State Department’s daily news briefing — the first to publicly address both the ceasefire claim and ex-PM Imran Khan’s continued detention during Trump’s second term in office.
Asked about Indian officials’ repeated denials of Trump’s role in the 2025 Line of Control ceasefire, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.
“That’s one of the good news aspects of our modern world — people can see what’s really occurring. You’re not reliant on a comment to know what has really happened.”
Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.” She laughed and moved on.
The comments came just hours after Trump himself revisited the claim during his joint appearance with Netanyahu. “We stopped a lot of fights. A very, very big one was India and Pakistan. We stopped that over trade,” Trump said. “They were maybe at a nuclear stage. Stopping that was really important.”
He added that the United States had used the threat of suspending trade talks to pressure both governments and that he had personally contacted the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad. He also referenced a meeting with Pakistan’s army chief as part of the de-escalation effort.
While Islamabad has not only endorsed this version but also submitted its own Nobel nomination for Trump last month, India continues to strongly refute it.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated this position after a recent meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, telling reporters that “President Trump had nothing to do with the ceasefire.” Indian officials have repeatedly emphasised that the de-escalation was prompted by internal military-level communications, not foreign mediation.
The Trump administration, however, has chosen not to affirm India’s denial — allowing President Trump’s pro-Pakistan narrative to stand uncontested.
For observers in Islamabad, this is significant. Not only is Trump being publicly credited by Pakistan, but the US government, for now, appears content to let that version circulate internationally — a quiet but unmistakable nod to Pakistan’s strategic utility in Washington’s broader diplomatic framework.
Silence on Imran Khan’s incarceration
When asked directly about Imran’s continued imprisonment — more than a year after his ouster and arrest — the State Department again chose silence over scrutiny.
“For the administration’s opinion regarding Mr. Khan’s situation, I would ask you to check with the White House and my colleague, Karoline Leavitt,” Bruce said, quickly steering the conversation away.
Instead of discussing the democratic process or rule of law — familiar themes in past US commentary on political detentions abroad — Bruce launched into an impassioned defence of President Trump’s global leadership.
“The President has made it clear that he doesn’t expect ever to win something of that sort [the Nobel Peace Prize], and yet the issue for him, the prize, is his success,” she said. “He is now not giving up on the world, and the people of the world are going to decide and make a determination of the greatness of Donald Trump.”
The absence of any reference to Imran’s legal rights or political status indicates a shift in US posture: prioritising stability over values and maintaining silence over expressing concern.
For many Pakistanis, particularly PTI supporters, this shift will be seen as a stark contrast to the more vocal positions taken by many US lawmakers against Imran’s incarceration in the recent past. In April, Republican US Congressman Jack Bergman renewed his call for the release of PTI founder following a recent visit to Islamabad where he met the civilian and military leadership. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions of the United States, Richard Grenell, has also consistently voiced support for Imran, calling for his release.
What this means for South Asia
The Trump administration’s emerging South Asia posture is becoming clearer: it is narrative-driven, highly personalised, and largely disengaged from the language of democracy promotion. Pakistan is framed as a cooperative security partner — one that responded positively to Trump’s pressure during the 2025 crisis. India is treated cautiously, without confrontation, but also without the deference New Delhi has come to expect in rejecting any notion of third-party mediation over Kashmir or border issues.
Trump’s references to a possible “nuclear stage” elevate the stakes of the 2025 standoff — and simultaneously bolster his claim to have acted decisively in a high-risk conflict. The claim serves a dual purpose: to enhance his diplomatic résumé internationally and to reinforce his leadership credentials at home.
Meanwhile, the State Department’s posture — ambiguous, amused, and noncommittal — suggests that the Trump administration is comfortable allowing multiple versions of events to exist simultaneously, as long as they don’t disrupt its broader strategic goals.
A Nobel quest and the future of mediation
Tuesday’s remarks make it clear that Trump views himself not only as a participant in global affairs but as a central figure shaping their outcomes. “He deserves every prize,” Bruce said. “He deserved this one for the Abraham Accords.”
Whether the Nobel Committee agrees or not is yet to be seen. But for Pakistan, the symbolism already matters. Trump’s consistent framing of Islamabad as a rational actor that helped de-escalate a major regional conflict — and his apparent disregard for India’s objections — marks a rare public relations victory in a region where international validation is often elusive.
The administration’s silence on Imran, however, sends a different message: that Washington will not risk strategic partnerships or public alignment with current regimes over questions of individual rights, especially not when those questions could complicate a carefully constructed peace narrative.
For now, Trump’s version of the 2025 crisis is gaining traction. Netanyahu’s nomination letter, Pakistan’s endorsement, and the State Department’s studied ambiguity all lend weight to the idea that the India-Pakistan ceasefire was not merely a moment of regional calm — but, in Trump’s telling, a defining chapter in his global peacemaking legacy.</p><small>2025-07-09 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091308240364afb.png?r=130930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923038/aurangzeb-reaffirms-govts-commitment-to-consultative-policy-framework' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb reaffirms govt’s commitment to consultative policy framework</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintaining a consultative policy framework as the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) transitioned its leadership.
Aurangzeb met with a delegation of the PBC led by outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ehsan Malik and incoming CEO Javed Kureishi at the Finance Division, the division said in a press release.
The minister welcomed the PBC’s transition in leadership and extended his full support to the incoming team, reaffirming the government’s commitment to maintaining an inclusive and ongoing consultative process with key stakeholders in the business community.
 






During the meeting, Aurangzeb appreciated the constructive role played by the PBC, particularly acknowledging the value of its policy input, research, and the extensive sectoral data regularly shared with the government.
He underscored the importance of evidence-based policymaking and informed the delegation that the Tax Policy Office had been relocated from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the Finance Division, intending to institutionalise tax policy formulation and strengthen engagement with forums such as the PBC.
Aurangzeb also emphasised that the government places high value on the perspectives and feedback of the business and industrial community, and in keeping with this approach, the consultative process for the federal budget 2025–26 was initiated earlier than usual this year.
This step was taken to allow greater time for dialogue, reflection and integration of a wide range of recommendations received from chambers, trade bodies, and business forums into the budget-making process, he added.</p><small>2025-07-09 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091317309ebaa2b.png?r=134631' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923028/chinese-air-chief-commends-pafs-exemplary-performance-during-pak-india-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese air chief commends PAF’s ‘exemplary performance’ during Pak-India conflict</strong></a><br><p>Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang has lauded the “exemplary performance” of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) during the Pakistan-India conflict in May.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military’s media affairs wing said in a press release on Tuesday.
“Lauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF’s leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.
 






Gen Wang, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.
During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy”.
During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the PAF used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s attack. However, China’s foreign ministry had said it was “not familiar with the matter”.
On Monday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir rejected India’s insinuation of direct Chinese support to Pak­­i­stan during the May conflict, calling it a “shoddy attempt” by New Delhi to repudiate Pakistan’s military capabilities.
According to a Reuters report, Indian army’s Deputy Chief Lt Gen Rahul Singh of India’s army had alleged that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict and provided “all possible support”.
During the meeting today, Lt Gen Gang also expressed “deep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities” of the PAF, according to ISPR.
He was “particularly impressed by PAF’s seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf’s keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations”.
The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF’s modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.
 
 

Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the “strong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF’s commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains”.
He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.
“The meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
Last week, the air chief also met with senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in “over a decade”.</p><small>2025-07-09 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0913071430744a4.jpg?r=130737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923030/armed-attackers-kill-3-in-kps-tank-police' target='_blank'><strong>Armed attackers kill 3 in KP’s Tank: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people, including two brothers, were killed inside their house by armed attackers in the Mulazai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.
Public Relations Officer (PRO) to the Tank District Police Officer Ahmad Khan told Dawn.com, “The incident took place in the Mulazai village where armed men entered the victims’ house and opened indiscriminate fire on them. As a result, three people, including two brothers, were killed.”
According to Khan, initial reports suggested that the incident was related to old enmity.
A first information report (FIR) was lodged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment of murder) and 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code against six suspects and further interrogation into the case has begun.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered on the complaint of the deceased father.
It stated that the complainant was asleep in his residence when he heard gunshots being fired. When he came out of his room, he saw “six people firing at his sons”, who then ran away. When he went to the guest room, he found all the victims dead.
The PRO said the dead bodies were shifted to the district headquarters hospital, Tank, for medical and legal procedures.
 
 

He added that the assailants had fled the scene after committing the crime.
On Monday, a woman was arrested in the Kata Kot area of Haripur district for allegedly beating her stepson to death.
In May, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district by five suspects who fled the scene, while six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in Peshawar.</p><small>2025-07-09 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613146-some-opinions-are-wrong-us-on-indias-denial-of-trumps-role-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>'Some opinions are wrong', US on India's denial of Trump's role in ceasefire with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Conservative influencers from Laura Loomer to Elon Musk have criticised Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel for their findings, which came months after Bondi pledged to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs”.
“It’s sitting on my desk right now to review,” Bondi told Fox News in February when she was asked if the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein’s client list.
On Tuesday at the White House, Bondi walked that comment back, telling reporters that she was referring to the entire Epstein “file” along with other files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said.
She added that the many of the videos in the Epstein investigative file “turned out to be child porn”. This material, she added, is “never going to be released. Never going to see the light of day”.
The Justice Department’s memo on Epstein, released on Monday, concluded that after reviewing more than 300 gigabytes of data, there was “no incriminating client list” nor was there any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.
 
 

The memo also confirmed prior findings by the FBI which concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and not as a result of a criminal act such as murder.
A subsequent report by the Justice Department’s inspector general later found that the Bureau of Prisons employees who were tasked with guarding Epstein failed to search his cell or check on him in the hours before his suicide.
Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a former conservative podcaster, both previously made statements before working at the FBI about a so-called client list and often suggested that the government was hiding information about Epstein from the American public.
Trump defended them in a Truth Social post on Monday amid a backlash by his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base, calling them the “greatest law enforcement professionals”.
 


He expressed annoyance when reporters asked him questions about Epstein on Tuesday at the White House during a cabinet meeting, saying, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?”
 


Musk claims former Trump aide in the files
Tech tycoon Elon Musk, now Trump’s estranged former close aide, said on X: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”
When their feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.
Musk further claimed Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump during his first presidency, was “in the Epstein files”.
He was replying to a post that shared a 2024 report stating that Epstein “spent hours being interviewed on camera” by Bannon.
 


“They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list,” Musk said in another post, referring to an Instagram-famous squirrel seized by New York state authorities last year.
“Government is deeply broken,” the Tesla boss added.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said his country hoped the truce would contribute to regional stability, and emphasised Riyadh’s position “in supporting dialogue through diplomatic means as a path to resolving disputes,” the ministry said in a post on X early on Wednesday.
According to the Saudi ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “expressed his gratitude” to Riyadh for its condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Iran last month.
 






Israel launched its unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran on June 13, targeting military and nuclear facilities as well as residential areas. The strikes killed more than 1,000 people in Iran, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists, according to Tehran.
Israel, in turn, was hit by waves of drone and missile fire from Iran, which Israeli authorities said left at least 28 people dead.
The United States, which had been in talks with Iran about its nuclear programme since April, joined Tel Aviv’s war and carried out its own strikes on Iran on June 22, targeting several nuclear sites.
The talks between Tehran and Washington have since stalled, but the ceasefire between Iran and Israel has been in place since June 24.
 
 

Iran and Saudi Arabia have often been on opposing sides of regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen. The two regional heavyweights broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 before re-establishing them in 2023 under a rapprochement deal brokered by China.
It amounted to a diplomatic achievement for Prince Mohammed, who has taken a more conciliatory approach to regional diplomacy in recent years.
Saudi Arabia condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran last month, calling them “aggressions” and a “clear violation of international laws”.
Riyad also expressed its “great concern” following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Araghchi held “fruitful conversations” with Prince Mohammed, as well as Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman about bilateral relations and developments in the region.</p><small>2025-07-09 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091031548a156d6.jpg?r=115433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923014/uae-denies-granting-lifetime-golden-visas-to-certain-nationalities' target='_blank'><strong>UAE denies granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) late on Tuesday night denied widespread media reports that claimed it had begun granting lifetime Golden Visas to select nationalities under a “new nomination-based” scheme, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).
The Golden Visa is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.
This week, several Indian media outlets, including The Press Trust of India and The Hindu, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.
Meanwhile, Times of India reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based Gulf News also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.
“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the WAM report said.
“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”
According to WAM, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.
The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.
The WAM report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”
It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”
The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.
 
 

The Economic Times quoted a top golden visa consultant based in Dubai as rebutting the Golden Visa reports.
“I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,” Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which Khaleej Times has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told Economic Times.
“The only new update they have is that crypto investors won’t be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don’t have any information on this, “ Marconi said.
He added that a “couple of officials […] in the same line of work” whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p><small>2025-07-09 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613127-phc-nullifies-ecps-notifications-on-kp-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>PHC nullifies ECP's notifications on KP reserved seats</strong></a><br><p>

• Rapid melting of glaciers due to record temperatures causes floods in Hunza, Diamer, Chilas, Nagar
• Karakoram Highway blocked at multiple points; locals evacuated as homes damaged
• Downpour leads to urban flooding in several parts of Punjab
GILGIT / LAHORE: Record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
The melting of ice, which resulted in glacier lake outburst floods (Glofs), blocked roads, damaged homes and left people stranded across GB on Tuesday.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), high temperatures were recorded across GB last week.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn the situation in GB is “unusual” this year.
He said high temperatures have increased the risk of flooding in rivers and streams, particularly in Diamer and Gilgit.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
Currently, the water level in rivers and streams across the region is dangerously high as inflows have increased due to rapidly melting glaciers.
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gandlu-Muladad Padi near Chilas on Tuesday.
A flood in Hamari stream damaged the Nagar Khas Valley road, while deluge in Supultar nullah blocked the Hoper Valley road.
The rising water level in rivers blocked the Chipurson Valley road in upper Hunza while Siachen Road in Ghanche was severely affected by river erosion in Thugs and Bangilongba areas.
Flooding in the Botogah nullah in Chilas damaged makeshift bridges, leaving the communities without any route to cross the waterway.
Flooding in Hamari and Supultar nullahs in Nagar damaged agricultural land, irrigation and drinking water supply systems, link roads and public and private infrastructures.
Many areas were without water and electricity supply after damage to the infrastructure.
Local administration said continued land erosion in the Hamorkhay area in Nagar Khas has submerged fields, trees and other infrastructure and was threatening over a dozen households.
Flood also damaged public and private properties in Chilas of Diamer, Chipurson areas.
A Glof from Shishper glacier in Hassanabad nullah, Hunza, has once again threatened KKH and local properties.
GBDMA said four houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure following the Glof event.
The local administration has warned people not to travel to affected areas as the risk of flooding and land erosion is high.
Rescue efforts
Mr Hussain, the head of GBDMA, said the authority has mobilised machinery to reopen roads blocked by flooding.
“Our first responsibility is to save the lives of people,” he said, adding locals in affected areas have been shifted to safe places.
The GBDMA was also restoring irrigation channels as a majority of people in the region depended upon agriculture as their livelihood.
According to Mr Hussain, the agency is now looking to identify the behaviours of glaciers to understand the scientific reasoning for melting.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has been requested to provide equipment for the monitoring of glaciers.
Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered the GBDMA, district administration and all relevant departments to remain alert in view of the floods.
All deputy commissioners have been ordered to take timely steps to prevent damage to life and property.
Urban flooding in Punjab
In Punjab, heavy monsoon rainfall on Tuesday triggered urban flooding in several cities as the province braces for above-average rainfall in the coming days.
In Lahore, rainfall led to waterlogging in Jail Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Liberty Chowk, and Lakshmi Chowk.
According to the Met Department, Jail Road and Qurtaba Chowk received the most rainfall, with 46 and 43 mm, respectively.
The average rainfall in the provincial capital on Tuesday was 40mm.
The deluge overwhelmed drainage systems in several areas, forcing the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) workers to install pumps to drain water from inundated areas.
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad has directed round-the-clock drainage of water.
He said all resources must be deployed to protect low-lying neighbourhoods from inundation.
Across Punjab, the rainfall pattern showed sharp variations, with Sheikhupura recording the province’s highest total at 48mm.
The provincial government has put all disaster response agencies on high alert after Lahore and several other districts recorded heavy downpours, with Nishtar Town receiving the highest rainfall at 52mm.
PDMA meeting
In Sialkot, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) DG Irfan Ali Kathia held an emergency meeting on the preparedness of local authorities.
Mr Kathia said the province is expected to receive 40 to 60 per cent above-normal rainfall in the coming days.
The heavy rain is expected to result in flooding, particularly in riverine areas near Head Marala, where water flow was 70,000 cusecs on Tuesday.
Local administrations have established relief camps stocked with food and water supplies, while electricity poles have been reinforced.
In rural areas, special teams have been mobilised to protect livestock and ensure their safety during the monsoon.
Gujranwala Division Commissioner Naveed Haider Shirazi has ordered the immediate evacuation of dilapidated buildings.
“We cannot risk any loss of life due to structural collapses during these rains,” Mr Shirazi warned, noting that 16 million residents in his division were potentially at risk.
The authorities have warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and report flooding immediately.
CM’s directives
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed all institutions to remain on alert during the monsoon season.
Officials of Wasa, PDMA, local government, Rescue 1122 and traffic police must remain in the field to oversee relief activities and help citizens.
She further directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners to monitor water drainage from low-lying areas and the traffic police should prepare plans to avoid gridlock.
