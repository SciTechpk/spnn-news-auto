In a statement on Thursday, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) slammed the call-up notice issued to Muhammad Akbar Notezai over a report that was published more than a year ago
In a joint statement, PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari expressed deep concern, saying that such actions not only undermined the fundamental right to freedom of expression, enshrined in the Constitution, but also represent a blatant attempt to suppress press freedom.
“We urge the authorities to respect the constitutional protections for freedom of expression and ensure that journalists are not targeted for their work, the notice issued to Akbar Notezai must be withdrawn immediately, and we demand that the FIA refrain from using cybercrime laws to silence journalists,” the PFUJ leaders said.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili also opposed the move, saying that “this action contributes to a climate of fear and is a misuse of cybercrime laws to silence the press”. He called on the authorities to withdraw the notice immediately.
Earlier, the Balochistan Union of Journalists and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also decried the move. BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar expressed concern that the government, despite all claims, was still using vile tactics to prevent them from performing their professional duties.
The HRCP noted that “such actions contribute to a climate of fear and intimidation for journalists and raise serious concerns about the misuse of cybercrime laws to curb press freedom” and called for the notice to be withdrawn.

WHILE heavy rains in July triggered catastrophic floods in South Asia, the upcoming week is expected to bring more heatwaves.—Reuters/file

• Beijing-based forecaster says high temperatures to persist in Pakistan, many other countries over next week
• Although this July wasn’t as record-breaking as previous ‘hottest’ months; experts say the reprieve is temporary
ISLAMABAD: The World Meteorological Centre (WMC) in Beijing has warned of impending heatwaves expected to sweep across various parts of the world, including Pakistan, from next week.
The warning comes as European forecasters revealed that this past July was the third-hottest on record — breaking a months-long record setting heat streak.
“Two years after the hottest July on record, the recent streak of global temperature records is over,” Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
“But that does not mean climate change has stopped,” he said, adding: “We continue to witness the effects of a warming world”.
“We continued to witness the effect of a warming world in events such as extreme heatwaves and catastrophic floods in July,” Buontempo said.
In July, heavy rains flooded Pakistan, India and China; Canada, Scotland and Greece struggled to tame wildfires intensified by persistent drought; and many nations in Asia and Scandinavia recorded new average highs for the month.
Heatwaves to persist
In its forecast, the WMC said that persistent high temperatures exceeding 38°C have been observed over the past week in West Asia, southern Central Asia, western South Europe, North Africa, Pakistan, southeastern India, central and southern Japan, southwestern United States, and northern Mexico.
“Notably, maximum temperatures exceeded 42°C in parts of West Asia, southern Central Asia, most of North Africa, southern Pakistan, and the southwestern United States, with localized areas surpassing 45°C. Maximum temperatures in southwestern Iran and eastern Iraq locally exceeded 50°C,” it said.
The forecast said that persistent influence from a subtropical high will maintain the heatwaves across most of these areas.
“Maximum temperatures in most of these regions will range between 38 and 40°C, with some areas exceeding 42°C. Specifically, localised temperatures could reach above 45°C in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, western and southern Iran, the southwestern United States, western Algeria, and northern Mauritania,” it said.
 
 

Global average temperatures are calculated using billions of satellite and weather readings, both on land and at sea, and the data used by Copernicus extends back to 1940.
Even if July was milder in some places than in previous years, 11 countries experienced their hottest July in at least a half-century, including China, Japan, North Korea, Tajikistan, Bhutan, Brunei and Malaysia,.
Seas overheating
Last month was also the third-hottest July on record for sea surface temperatures.
Locally, however, several ocean records for July were broken: in the Norwegian Sea, in parts of the North Sea, in the North Atlantic west of France and Britain.
The extent of Arctic sea ice was 10 per cent below average, the second lowest for a July in 47 years of satellite observations, virtually tied with the readings of 2012 and 2021.
Diminishing sea ice is a concern not because it adds to sea levels, but because it replaces the snow and ice that reflect almost all the Sun’s energy back into space with deep blue ocean, which absorbs it.
Ninety per cent of the excess heat generated by global warming is absorbed by the oceans.
In Antarctica, sea ice extent is the third lowest on record for this month.

The lander’s ascent and descent systems underwent comprehensive verification at a site in Hebei province that was designed to simulate the moon’s surface. The test surface had special coating to mimic lunar soil reflectivity, as well as being covered with rocks and craters.
“The test involved multiple operational conditions, a lengthy testing period, and high technical complexity, making it a critical milestone in the development of China’s manned lunar exploration program,” China Manned Space (CMS) said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday.
The lunar lander, known as Lanyue, which means “embrace the moon” in Mandarin, will be used to transport astronauts between the lunar orbit and the moon’s surface, as well as serving as a living space, power source, and data center after they land on the moon, CMS added.
China has kept details closely guarded about its programme to achieve a manned landing on the moon, but the disclosure about the test comes at a time when the United States is looking to stave off the rapid advances of China’s space programme.
Nasa plans for its Artemis programme to send astronauts around the moon and back in April 2026, with a subsequent moon landing mission a year later.
 
 

China’s uncrewed missions to the moon in the past five years have allowed the country to become the only nation to retrieve lunar samples from both the near and far side of the moon.
Those missions have drawn interest from the European Space Agency, Nasa-funded universities, and national space agencies from Pakistan to Thailand.
A successful manned landing before 2030 would boost China’s plans to build a “basic model” of the International Lunar Research Station by 2035.
This manned base, led by China and Russia, would include a nuclear reactor on the moon’s surface as a power source.

The attack was triggered by the situation the people of Gaza have faced since the blockade of 2007. Despite their desperation, Israel resorted to a predictably massive and disproportionate response, leading to destruction and misery in Gaza at a scale not witnessed before.
Over 70 per cent of Gaza’s built structures lie flattened by incessant bombardment and ground assaults. Most of the energy, water and sewerage infrastructure has been destroyed. Conservative estimates suggest that over 60,000 individuals have been killed so far, with one of the highest proportions of child deaths — an estimated 17,000 — recorded in any modern urban siege or conflict.
The indiscriminate use of force by the Israel Defence Forces and a complete blockade of humanitarian aid has been abetted, if not encouraged, by the Western powers. Protests by neighbouring Muslim countries have been muted and uncoordinated. President Donald Trump’s high-profile visit to the Middle East in May this year has yielded no solution or ceasefire in any negotiation or communiqué. It has been a glaring omission and missed opportunity, with major ramifications.
When negotiations collapsed in March this year, Israel completely blocked the entry of humanitarian assistance, food, medicine and water to Gaza, leading to one of the worst man-made humanitarian disasters in recent memory. All but one hospital has been destroyed and over 765,000 people displaced since Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, 2025.
Most of Gaza’s population now lives in abysmal circumstances — in ruined homes and temporary shelters, squeezed within less than 12pc of the Strip’s total area, with major curbs on their movement. Disruptions in basic services, safe water and access to medications have played havoc with lives. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Fund, set up by Israel and the US to provide assistance, is not only grossly inadequate but also a death trap for desperate people seeking food. Children have paid a disproportionate price over the last 21 months, given their vulnerability and limited resilience.

Gaza has seen the highest proportion of child deaths and injuries in any modern urban conflict.

Although the full picture of the health and nutrition consequences of the Gaza siege and bombardment will emerge only when the rubble is cleared, conservative estimates show that the death count may be significantly higher than reported. The longer-term effects on survivors will be much greater in terms of injuries, suffering and mental health as they will be on health and development outcomes, especially for children. The deliberate targeting and destruction of Gaza’s health services and facilities has also impacted newborn and child survival and led to an exponential increase in childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery and acute respiratory infections. However, some of the most damaging and enduring consequences stem from prolonged undernutrition and starvation, through a despicable policy of food blockade, which is akin to genocide.
The crisis has reached an extreme stage. According to the most recent figures from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report (July 29), the situation in Gaza fulfils two of the three requirements for a famine declaration — namely that at least one in three children is acutely malnourished; one in five people suffers from extreme food shortage; and two of every 10,000 people die from starvation or malnutrition and disease, although this level of reporting is impossible in conflict settings without surveys. In Gaza, some 39pc of the population reports not having eaten for days and rates of severe acute malnutrition have quadrupled over the last two months and exceed 15pc in most areas.
The long-term consequences of such mass starvation on vulnerable women and children are massive and well-documented in the literature. The blockade of food to Holland’s population in the winter of 1944-45, at the tail end of World War II, was also known as the ‘Dutch Hunger Winter’. Its consequences continue to be tracked. Babies born to malnourished mothers in that period have been shown to bear scars of a higher burden of illnesses and mental health issues. Indeed, they are at a far higher risk of non-communicable diseases for the rest of their lives. All of these consequences in the Gaza conflict will need long-term follow-up.
As members of the Standing Together for Nutrition Consortium, nutrition scientists across the globe published a comment in The Lancet last month, demanding action for stopping the use of mass starvation as a weapon of war. They have rightly pointed out that undernutrition is not only a consequence of war, it is also the seed for future conflicts. If an entire generation is allowed to grow up hungry, traumatised and without hope, we all are complicit in setting the stage for further suffering.
History will judge the global community harshly for failing Gaza and its people, and permitting this mass violation of humanitarian principles. The use of mass starvation of besieged populations, especially women and children, as a weapon of war is strictly prohibited under international law. But Gaza is not the only recent example where this has happened. We witnessed similar atrocities in the Syrian conflict, and millions of women and children in Sudan today face comparable brutality, in this instance at the hands of fellow Muslims.
We call upon all leaders of the OIC representing 48 Muslim-majority countries to further press for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and hold a specific emergency session. Apart from calls for an independent Palestinian state, discussions should focus on measures to completely ban the use of food blockades and mass starvation as weapons of war, collective enforcement measures in case of non-compliance, and allocation of appropriate resources for the desperate people of Gaza once the conflict is over. Many eyes are now focused on the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York this September. If a call is given for an immediate ceasefire and comprehensive humanitarian action in Gaza, it could become a turning point.

“Now that the nuclear arsenal being ‘created’ by Iran has been totally OBLITERATED, it is very important to me that all Middle Eastern Countries join the Abraham Accords,” Trump wrote in a social media post.
As part of the Abraham Accords, signed during Trump’s first term in office, four Muslim-majority countries agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation. Efforts to expand the accords have been complicated by a soaring death toll and starvation in Gaza.
 
 

The war in Gaza, where local authorities say more than 60,000 people have died, has provoked global anger. Canada, France and the United Kingdom have announced plans in recent days to recognise an independent Palestinian state.
Trump’s administration is actively discussing with Azerbaijan the possibility of bringing that nation and some Central Asian allies into the Abraham Accords, hoping to deepen their existing ties with Israel, according to five sources with knowledge of the matter.
During his first term in 2020, Trump secured a series of deals, known as the Abraham Accords, to establish official diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.

However, when it comes to addressing complex and long-term global challenges like climate change, democratic systems can fall short. This is particularly true in developing democracies such as Pakistan, where climate thre­ats continue to intensify despite growing public awareness and mounting international pressure.
While democratic governance is rooted in representation and transparency, these same streng­ths can become obstacles when a crisis demands swift, science-based, and often politically unpopular decisions. The short-term nature of electoral politics, the influence of vested interests, the appeal of populist narratives, and the institutional conservatism inherent in democracies all combine to hinder the urgent and transformative action needed to combat climate change.
Climate policies that are crucial for long-term sustainability — such as removing fossil fuel subsidies, introducing carbon taxes or restricting water usage — often impose short-term hardships. These measures are politically risky, particularly in countries like Pakistan, where inflation, energy shortages and unemployment already weigh heavily on the population. Faced with the fear of losing voter support, elected officials are reluctant to advance such necessary but unpopular reforms.
This reveals a troubling mismatch: democratic systems, especially in fragile states, are not structurally equipped to handle the scale, urgency and complexity of climate change. The result has been a global rise in populist leadership — both in the Global North and South — that further undermines environmental governance.

Democratic systems in fragile states are not structurally equipped to handle the complexity of climate change.

By contrast, states like China, Singapore, the UAE, Qatar and Vietnam, notwithstanding restrictions on civil liberties, political freedoms and media openness, have made significant strides in policy implementation, economic development, and poverty reduction. These countries, often unhindered by the procedural delays of democratic governance, have demonstrated a greater ability to enact long-term policies, maintain institutional continuity and deliver visible results in areas like health, education, infrastructure development and sustainability.
In democracies, however, meaningful climate action is frequently delayed by the need for consensus, lengthy legislative processes and judicial review. These checks and balances, while crucial for safeguarding freedoms, also slow down the implementation of urgently needed reforms.
 
 

One of the deepest challenges in managing climate change within a democratic framework is the electoral cycle itself. Governments are incentivised to focus on short-term, visible projects that can win immediate public approval, rather than investing in climate resilience or renewable ene­rgy systems whose benefits may only be realised years later. Long-term climate strategies are often sacrificed at the altar of short-term political gains.
Pakistan, despite contributing less than one per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions, ranks am­­ong the countries most vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability presents both a moral argument for climate justice and a political opportunity for elected leaders to deflect responsibility. Often, inaction is framed as the result of donor ne­glect or global inequity — narratives that resonate domestically but fail to drive proactive national policy.
Another structural challenge lies in the disproportionate influence of powerful interest groups, particularly in the fossil fuel, agriculture and construction sectors. These groups exert considerable pressure on lawmakers through lobbying, media manipulation and patronage networks. As a result, policies that threaten their economic interests are routinely watered down or delayed. Urban development, for instance, often proceeds unchecked, with housing societies expanding into forested and peri-urban areas despite environmental risks. This highlights how private interests can override public concerns in democratic settings.
Pakistan’s youth-dominated demographic landscape offers both a challenge and an opportunity. With over 60 per cent of the population under 35 and a legal voting age of 18, young people now form the largest electoral bloc. In theory, this could drive more forward-thinking environmental policies. In practice, however, the situation is far more complex. The country has consistently had over 25 million out-of-school children for the past two decades, contributing to widespread educational deficits and low levels of civic and scientific literacy among voters.
A poorly educated electorate is more susceptible to populist rhetoric and misinformation, particularly during times of economic distress. This creates a political climate in which evidence-based environmental discourse is often drowned out by short-term nationalist narratives.
Moreover, the fact that 40pc of children under five suffer from stunting (a condition linked not only to malnutrition but also to long-term cognitive delays and impaired decision-making in adulthood) is worrisome. The long-term implication is diminished capacity for civic engagement, critical thinking and collective decision-making, all of which are essential for democratic governance and sustainable development. Democracy offers a mechanism for public input, but if the quality of that input is compromised, it weakens the electorate’s ability to demand, understand or support the stru­ctural reforms needed for sustainable development.
While democracy remains an important mechanism for ensuring public participation, its effectiveness is severely compromised when basic systems of education, health and equity are underdeveloped. Without meaningful investments in human capital, democratic participation becomes wide in scope but shallow in deliberative capacity.
In its current form, Pakistan’s democratic system lacks the resilience and coherence required to respond effectively to the climate crisis. Electoral short-termism, institutional fragility, policy fragmentation and elite capture all limit the country’s ability to implement long-term environmental strategies. Delay in response can result in deepening the crisis.
What is urgently needed is a reimagining of democracy — one that retains its participatory core while building structures capable of delivering sustained policy continuity. This includes independent climate bodies, technocratic planning units insulated from political cycles, and investments in education and civic literacy to strengthen the electorate’s role in shaping a more sustainable future.

Over the past few days, the KP government has hosted three major jirgas in different parts of the former tribal belt to gauge public opinion about how to deal with resurgent terrorist activity. The local tribes have demanded talks with the Afghan Taliban, as well as negotiations with banned groups, while some reports suggest a consensus in the merged areas against further military operations — perhaps it is in response to these concerns that the state minister for interior has said there will be no operation. Local jirgas elsewhere have endorsed similar demands. Meanwhile, the KP administration has planned to host a grand jirga to chart a way forward.
For over 20 years, KP, including the former Fata region, has faced almost constant violence on account of both terrorism and CT operations. People have lost loved ones and faced displacement. Fatigue and desperation after two decades of conflict have led the tribal people to demand talks with the militants and an end to kinetic action.
Yet while the views of the local people should be heard, it must also be remembered that terrorist groups have mostly broken the pacts signed with the state. There is no guarantee they will honour their agreements this time; peace deals may offer temporary relief but eventually collapse. Moreover, the state — specifically the military — refers to the banned TTP as ‘India-backed Fitna al Khawarij’; will this description remain if talks go ahead?
Secondly, will the militants agree to renounce violence in case of successful negotiations? Unless they do, any resultant peace deal will only weaken the state. Furthermore, the state has sent several delegations to talk to the Afghan Taliban, in order to urge them to rein in Afghanistan-based militants. No tangible long-term effects of these talks have been visible in the form of reduced violence.
Perhaps we find ourselves at this juncture because ever since the ‘war on terror’ was launched in this region, the state’s CT policy has failed to create lasting peace. This is despite the fact that we have lost thousands of civilians, military men and police personnel in the war against militancy. Despite successive military operations, as well as CT policies such as NAP and NAP 2.0, and multiple attempts to stamp out violent extremism, we find ourselves back to square one.
A thorough review of the state’s CT policies is required by the civilian leadership, the intelligence community, the establishment and area experts. This cycle of rising militancy, kinetic action, displacement, temporary calm and resurgent militancy must be broken, and a permanent solution to Pakistan’s militancy problem found.

The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a “lack of qualifying bids”.
Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB’s regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.
Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.
Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.
According to NAB’s advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer’s corporate offices.
NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.
 
 

A source in NAB told Dawn that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.
The remaining three properties — Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi — will be auctioned later.
No date has been announced yet for the next auction.
NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz’s son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.
Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the Bahria Town Karachi case.
The auction followed the Islamabad High Court’s dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.
Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.

The development came after a high-level meeting in Karachi where Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and MWM leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri addressed the media, confirming a seven-point agree­­ment.
The minister confirmed that the government would facilitate the extension of pilgrims’ visas for up to 60 days in coordination with the Iraqi government. He also assured the pilgrims that special discounted flights would be arranged for them.
 
 

The government will also ensure the refund of payments made to buses, transport companies and tour operators for land travel. Mr Chaudhry also emphasised that the Taftan-Rimdan border, a crucial route for pilgrims, would remain open, although the government has advised against land travel this year.
Allama Nasir pointed out that the travel restrictions caused immense difficulties for pilgrims. “But today, after successful talks and assurances from the government, we are end­ing our march,” he added.

• Met Office warns of more heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from Shisper Glacier swelled the Hassanabad Nullah in Hunza, damaging infrastructure, and putting dozens of mountainside homes at risk in the mountainous region of Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials said the heavy flood eroded the protective walls of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) and damaged farmland. Due to land erosion caused by the nullah, dozens of houses are at risk in case of such events in the future.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Manage­ment Authority (GBDMA), the flood damaged the newly constructed retaining wall and a portion of the Kara­koram Highway. Though the highway is open to all types of traffic, the damaged section has been sealed off for safety measures.
 
 

The authority said a significant area of cultivable land, along with standing crops and trees, had been wiped out in the flood, while the electricity supply to Hassanabad was also disrupted. Similarly, a property owned by the Forest Dep­artment had suffered damage while a portion of Frontier Works Orga­ni­sa­tion’s land adjacent to a bri­dge also sustained damage.
Locals said that four houses downstream were dismantled in time to save them from the flood. Last month, a similar Glof event damaged four houses, agricultural land, trees, and public and private properties.
The authority requested the National Highway Authority (NHA) to urgently visit the site to assess the damaged section and inspect other vulnerable parts of the road. Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committee members, GBDMA staff, and other volunteers were actively monitoring the situation on the site and supporting community preparedness and response efforts.
On the other hand, the Gilgit-Shandur Road remained closed off for the seventh day in Khotom village of the Phander valley, stranding thousands of people in the area.
Met Office alert
On the other hand, the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Thursday afternoon issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert, Dawn.com reported.

• Asad Qaiser demands transparent trial of Imran; Marwat seeks inquiry into ‘attack on parliament’
• Commerce ministry says $1 billion saved after US tariff reduced from 29 to 19pc
ISLAMABAD: As the PTI vigorously opposed any potential military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following a spike in terror incidents, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday said action against militants under the National Action Plan would continue, despite their objections.
The minister was responding to PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in the lower house of parliament as the latter vowed to oppose any offensive in the PTI-ruled province to eradicate militancy.
Mr Qaiser warned against such attempts, saying they would put up resistance against such plans. His statement is consistent with PTI founder Imran Khan’s stance, who had asked the KP government to oppose such measures, as well as that of the tribal people who have expressed apprehensions against new military offensives.
In response, the minister ruled out a new operation but said measures under NAP would continue, adding that nobody can stop such measures.
Mr Chaudhry also urged the provincial authorities to fulfil their responsibilities to tackle the menace, saying Khyber Pakhtunkhwa received Rs700 billion under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award for counter-terrorism measures.
He, however, rued that the province had done nothing to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies.
“I know why you are disturbed,” he said while addressing Mr Qaiser. Chiding the PTI leadership for alleged resettlement of the TTP terrorists in Pakistan, he asked if they were with the militants or the state.
It may be noted that after initial action, a potential military operation had been postponed in Bajaur following successful talks between the Bajaur Aman Jirga and the banned TTP.
 
 

About the claims of Imran Khan being the most popular leader, he said popularity did not prove innocence, adding that monuments honouring martyrs had been desecrated during the May 9 violence in 2023.
Crackdown on PTI
Earlier, PTI leader Asad Qaiser also demanded a transparent and independent trial of Imran Khan. “We are referring to an ‘independent trial’ of cases against Imran Khan when we talk about his release”, he clarified.
He said that the PTI leadership had been struggling for the country’s sovereignty and fighting for the supremacy of the Constitution and law. He recalled that the PTI parliamentarians were whisked away from the Parliament House by unidentified men and now they were being disqualified on the pretext of the May 9 violence.
 






The opposition leader said the National Assembly had been turned into a rubber stamp, adding that he would ask his party members to boycott the proceedings of the house for being “unlawful”. He regretted that the gates of the house were closed for the PTI parliamentarians and a BPS-18 or BPS-19 officer humiliated them.
Disgruntled PTI member Sher Afzal Marwat questioned whether the PML-N and the PPP had signed the Charter of Democracy to misbehave with the leaders and parliamentarians of other political parties.
 






“Such an attitude is creating hatred in the political culture,” he said, adding that he would always remember the personnel of agencies and police standing outside the assembly. “I shall never tolerate these people outside the Assembly if I am given the authority of the speaker even for a day,” he remarked.
He demanded the constitution of a committee of the house for an inquiry into what he termed an “attack on Parliament House”. Mr Marwat was among several PTI lawmakers who had been picked up from the premises of parliament in a late-night raid in September last year.
US tariff
Earlier, during Question Hour, the house was told that the recent trade deal signed with the United States would boost Pakistan’s exports and positively impact the economy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the 19pc tariff rate offered to Pakistan was the lowest in the South Asian region.
Separately, the commerce ministry, in a written response, informed the house that the change in the US tariff from 29pc to 19pc saved Pakistan at least $1 billion.
“…instead of one billion dollars loss, Pakistan’s exports have the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market,” the response attributed to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said.
 






Lifesaving drugs
Responding to a calling attention notice, Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services Nelson Azeem said that there was no shortage of lifesaving medicines, including insulin and cancer drugs. He admitted there was a shortage in May during tensions with India.
PPP’s Sharmila Farooqui, who raised the matter, however, noted that the parliamentary secretary was unaware of ground realities and insisted that there was an intermittent shortage in both urban and rural areas.
 






She regretted that about 100 key positions in the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan were vacant, affecting the performance of the authority responsible for controlling the prices and ensuring the availability of drugs.
She said, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the prices of these lifesaving drugs had been increasing by 17.5 per cent every year. According to the June price index, the prices went up by 13 and 15 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively, she added.

Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said the force had taken prompt action and launched a search operation to arrest the suspects.
“The suspects stripped the boy, beat him with sticks, and filmed the assault before making the video go viral on social media,” Faheem said.
Quoting District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi, the spokesperson said he reacted strongly to the incident and said that “no powerful person can target the weak or poor class, the law is equal for everyone.”
He said the district police took immediate notice of the incident and directed the Hoti police to take strict action against the culprits.
According to Faheem, Hoti police Station House Officer Riaz Khan ordered immediate action and registered a case against two residents of Gali Bagh, Misri Abad Road.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at Hoti Police Station on Wednesday at the complaint of the victim under Sections 292 (sale, etc of obscene books, etc), 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation), 376 (rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation; if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Sections 37 (punishment for violence) and 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.
According to the complainant, the video was recorded one year ago.
Police added that special teams have been formed to arrest the suspects.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objectives of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” said Sahil.
Earlier this week, police in Mardan arrested four individuals in a case involving a viral video wherein the suspects were involved in the harassment of a teenage girl.
The action was taken on KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s instructions after the incident was highlighted by journalists.</p><small>2025-08-07 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07213203b092530.jpg?r=213243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929345/trump-to-sign-order-requiring-universities-to-disclose-admissions-data-on-race' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to sign order requiring universities to disclose admissions data on race</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order requiring universities to hand over admissions data to prove that they are not engaged in affirmative action efforts, the White House press secretary said in a post on X on Thursday.
In her post on X, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not give details on the order, such as the ramifications universities will face if they do not cooperate.
 






Since taking office for his second term, Trump’s administration has attempted to dismantle affirmative action policies at universities, launching dozens of investigations and threatening to cut off funding to schools that promote diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Trump has particularly taken aim at Harvard University since he took office, calling the institution a “joke” that teaches “hate and stupidity” and going as far as to freeze their government funding.
In May, Trump’s administration revoked Harvard’s right to enrol foreign students — more than a quarter of its annual enrollment.
Though the move was blocked by a judge, the US president stood by his decision.
“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”</p><small>2025-08-07 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07215759abca975.jpg?r=220658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929346/cricketer-haider-ali-suspended-by-pcb-amid-uk-police-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Cricketer Haider Ali suspended by PCB amid UK police investigation</strong></a><br><p>Cricketer Haider Ali was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday due to his involvement in an investigation being carried out by police in the UK, according to a statement.
The PCB announced last month that Saud Shakeel would lead an 18-member Pakistan Shaheens squad to tour England from July 17 to August 6 for two three-day and three 50-over matches. Ali was a part of the squad.
According to the statement, the PCB was informed about the investigation by the Greater Manchester Police regarding an incident that reportedly took place during the tour.
The nature of the incident was not immediately clear, nor were any details provided in the statement itself.
“In line with its duty of care and responsibility to ensure the welfare and legal rights of all its players, the PCB has ensured that Haider Ali has received appropriate legal support to protect his rights throughout this process,” the PCB stated.
The statement added that the cricket board acknowledged British legal processes and the importance of allowing an investigation to run its course.
“Accordingly, the PCB has decided to place Haider Ali under provisional suspension, effective immediately, pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation,” the statement read.
“Once the legal proceedings are concluded and all facts have been duly established, the PCB reserves the right to take appropriate action under its Code of Conduct, if necessary.”
The statement added that the PCB would not issue any further comment on the matter until it reaches its “legal conclusion”.

Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com: “A total of 20 fire tenders with two snorkels, five ambulances and water boozers were engaged in the fire that was controlled at 4pm.”
The rescue official detailed that they received information about the incident at 10am, following which hectic efforts remained underway till the fire was put out in the evening. However, cooling work continued.
 


“Some repair/construction work was also underway at the factory, whose structure ostensibly appeared to be weak,” Haseeb said. He added that eight factory workers who were removing goods, despite warnings from firemen not to do so, were injured as part of the building collapsed.
“They did not give any heed to such warnings, probably [because] they were under strict instructions from the factory management to remove the goods from it and shift the same to a safer place,” the Rescue 1122 official explained.
According to the rescue spokesperson, the factory staff told the firemen that some welding work was ongoing in the five-storey building’s basement, which triggered the fire. Further investigation into the incident was underway.
Haseeb noted: “It was a vast area and wind direction was heavy, which caused rapid spread of the fire, and resultantly, three adjoining factories also caught fire.”
While the structure of those three factories was intact, they sustained damage. However, the first building from which the fire originated was completely destroyed.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson estimated there were 1,200 workers who worked in the said factories, and those present on the site were evacuated safely.
Haseeb said some fire tenders were dispatched initially, but realising the gravity of the problem, more fire tenders were called from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122.
“The injured were taken to a nearby hospital via Edhi ambulance,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement earlier today.
Earlier in the day, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the fire and directed officials to take immediate steps to save people on a priority basis.
 






He directed all fire brigades and rescue agencies to take immediate action, while Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi was tasked with a thorough inquiry into the cause.
The chief minister assured factory owners and workers affected by the incident of full assistance.
CM Shah was informed that many employees were present inside the factory when the blaze broke out, but rescue teams successfully evacuated all personnel safely.
The chief minister was informed that one individual was injured during the building collapse and issued directives to provide immediate medical aid to the victim.

The nuclear-armed rivals exchanged artillery, drone and air strikes in May, after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for a deadly attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. The four-day confrontation came to an end when US President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire.
In a post on X, Netanyahu announced that he met the Indian ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, in Jerusalem today, where the pair “discussed strengthening and expanding cooperation between Israel and India, particularly in the fields of security and economics”.
“Afterward, I held a meeting with a group of senior journalists from India and answered their questions,” the Israeli leader wrote.
 






According to Indian television channel NDTV, Netanyahu confirmed the use of Israeli weapons during India’s military operations in May, including the deployment of HARPY drones and the Barak-8 missile, which is jointly developed with India.
“The things we provided before worked very well on the field… we develop our weapons in the field and they are battle-tested,” the Israeli PM was quoted as saying by NDTV. “They worked fine and we have a pretty solid foundation.”
The channel added that Israel was one of several countries that supported Operation Sindoor. Kobbi Shoshani, the Consul General in Mumbai, said it was “essential” to send a strong message to the terrorists.
“That (Operation Sindoor) was an action of self-defence, and I’m very proud of this operation,” Shoshani was quoted as saying.
According to Indian channel News18, New Delhi deployed the HARPY and SkyStriker loitering munitions “to great effect” during Operation Sindoor, reportedly targeting Pakistani air defence and surveillance systems.
 
 

Over the last decade, India has imported military hardware worth $2.9 billion from Israel, including radars, surveillance and combat drones, and missiles.
In 2019, India struck what it claimed was a “terrorist training camp” in Balakot with Israeli-made Rafael SPICE “smart bombs”, though local residents in the area claimed nobody had been injured or killed.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07193001f551411.jpg?r=193018' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929339/pm-shehbaz-calls-for-national-policy-to-address-rapid-population-growth' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls for national policy to address rapid population growth</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an immediate national policy to address Pakistan’s rapid population growth rate on Thursday.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost forty-five per cent of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
The prime minister termed the high population growth rate an “alarming trend” and said that immediate and coordinated policy action was required at a national level to address the issue. The World Bank reported Pakistan’s annual growth rate for 2024 as 1.5pc.
The statement came during a high-level meeting chaired by the premier at his office to review the challenges posed by Pakistan’s rising population and deliberate on effective strategies to manage it, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.
The meeting was also attended by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf and Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, along with senior officials from institutions.
“We need comprehensive planning to ensure our growing population, especially the youth, becomes a productive part of the economy,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
 






“A large segment of our population comprises young people, who are the most valuable asset for our country.”
He emphasised that the government was taking several initiatives to empower the youth and integrate them into the country’s economic mainstream.
“Opportunities are being created to enable our youth to play a central role in national development,” he added.
 
 

Speaking on gender inclusion, Shehbaz underlined the critical importance of women’s participation in the workforce.
“Women constitute a significant portion of our human capital. We must ensure greater employment opportunities for them,” he said.
The premier instructed the formation of a committee to develop a comprehensive and effective national policy, in close collaboration with provincial governments.
“A unified and strategic response is the need of the hour,” he said, calling for a coordinated federal-provincial framework to tackle population-related issues.
He also stressed the importance of launching a nationwide awareness campaign to educate citizens about the implications of unchecked population growth, especially in the context of sustainable economic development.
During the meeting, the premier was briefed on various proposals and recommendations to manage population growth. Officials stressed that any long-term solution would require active provincial collaboration and public engagement at the grassroots level.
Last month, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said that population growth in Pakistan has reached an alarming level. He highlighted the wide-ranging consequences of the demographic challenge, including over 25m children currently being out of school and overcrowding at government hospitals.
In June, parliamentarians unanimously approved a resolution on population stabilisation and vowed to table it in the National Assembly.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071903321801bae.png?r=192219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929336/muzaffargarh-police-arrest-2-suspects-for-allegedly-raping-disabled-teenage-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Muzaffargarh police arrest 2 suspects for allegedly raping disabled teenage girl</strong></a><br><p>Police on Thursday said they had arrested suspects for allegedly raping a deaf-mute and mentally disabled girl in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district.
Muzaffargarh police spokesperson Wasim Khan Gopang told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Rohilanwali area on Aug 4.
“Two suspects had been arrested within 24 hours of the incident.”
He said the 17-year-old girl was in the fields when one of the suspects allegedly caught her and raped her. “The suspect fled when locals reached the spot after hearing the girl’s voice,” he added.
In a first information report (FIR) dated Aug 6, seen by Dawn.com, the victim’s brother said that his sister was born deaf-mute and mentally disabled.
He said, “She went out of the house to relieve herself in the fields on Aug 4 around 05:30pm.”
The complainant detailed that the suspect, who was standing near the field, “forcibly grabbed the victim and raped her under a tree.”
The FIR named two passersby who heard the victim’s voice and caught the suspect raping her. “Upon seeing the men, the suspect ran away. Subsequently, the witnesses chased him for a long time, but he managed to escape,” it added.
The complainant said he, the victim’s father, and the witnesses went to the suspect’s father — who was also booked in the case as a co-accused.
“The suspect’s father started cursing and threatening me due to a previous fight and an ongoing land dispute,” the complainant said, adding, “I believe the suspect raped the girl on his father’s instructions.”
A case was registered at the Rohilanwali police station under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 376 (iii) (punishment for rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary in May.
In April, a 17-year-old girl died by suicide after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Muzaffargarh.
The same month, police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071858447c0fea5.jpg?r=190211' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/indias-modi-unwilling-to-compromise-on-agriculture-as-us-tariff-war-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi unwilling to compromise on agriculture as US tariff war escalates</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, a day after United States President Donald Trump announced 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods.
Washington announced the hike in levies on Wednesday, citing New Delhi’s purchasing of Russian oil, a key revenue source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market.
India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.
“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.
“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.
India has also refused to allow the import of genetically modified products.
 


Additionally, New Delhi fears that allowing the import of dairy products may upset the cultural and religious sensitivities of India’s majority Hindus, who revere cows as sacred.
It seems a far cry from India’s early hopes for special tariff treatment.
In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.
Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.
India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Modi, meanwhile, according to Indian media but not confirmed by officials, may visit China in late August, which would be his first visit since 2018.
Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping last met in Russia in October 2024.
Indian exporters warned that additional US tariffs risked making businesses “not viable”.
Stocks opened marginally lower on Thursday, with the benchmark Nifty index down 0.31 per cent after an initial 25pc US tariff came into effect.
India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars on discounted crude.
India’s foreign ministry condemned Trump’s announcement of further tariffs, calling the move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
 






S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said he feared a troubling impact.
“This move is a severe setback for Indian exports, with nearly 55pc of our shipments to the US market directly affected,” he said in a statement.
“The 50pc reciprocal tariff effectively imposes a cost burden, placing our exporters at a 30–35pc competitive disadvantage compared to peers from countries with lesser reciprocal tariff.”
Ralhan said “many export orders have already been put on hold” as buyers reassess sourcing decisions.
For “a large number” of small to medium-sized enterprises, profit “margins are already thin”, he said.
“Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable,” he added.
India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.
 
 

“If the extra 25pc tariff that President Trump has announced on imports from India remains in place, India’s attractiveness as an emerging manufacturing hub will be hugely undermined,” Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a note.
US spending drives around 2.5pc of India’s GDP, Shah said.
But a 50pc tariff is “large enough to have a material impact”, he added, with the resulting drop in exports meaning the economy would grow by closer to 6pc this year and next, down from the 7pc they currently forecast.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071732092cce89d.png?r=180339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929333/nepra-slashes-uniform-tariff-by-rs189-for-aug-oct' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.
A notification dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com said that the authority “decided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.
“Accordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.”
Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.
Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.
According to a separate Nepra notification — also dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com — the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.
Nepra decided that the FCA “shall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”, the notification read.
The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers’ bills based on the units billed to them in June.
“In case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,” Nepra added.
“While effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.”
In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh
“The actual fuel charges, as claimed by CPРА, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,” the notification read.
Today’s notifications come in the wake of a Nepra hearing discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.
The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p><small>2025-08-07 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07163308f557437.png?r=164658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929325/trumps-higher-tariffs-hit-major-us-trading-partners-sparking-defiance-and-concern' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s higher tariffs hit major US trading partners, sparking defiance and concern</strong></a><br><p>United States trade partners such as Switzerland, Brazil and India were still scrambling to get a better deal on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s higher tariff rates on imports from dozens of countries kicked in, raising the average US import duty to its highest in a century.
The US Customs and Border Protection agency began collecting the higher tariffs of 10 per cent to 50pc at 12:01am EDT (09:01am PKT) after weeks of suspense over Trump’s final tariff rates and frantic negotiations with major trading partners that sought to lower them.
The leaders of Brazil and India vowed not to be cowed by Trump’s hardline bargaining position, even while their negotiators sought a reprieve from the highest tariff levels.
The new rates will test Trump’s strategy for shrinking US trade deficits without causing massive disruptions to global supply chains or provoking higher inflation and stiff retaliation from trading partners.
After unveiling his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, Trump has frequently modified his plan, slapping much higher rates on imports from some countries, including 50pc for goods from Brazil, 39pc from Switzerland, 35pc from Canada and 25pc from India.
He announced on Wednesday a separate, 25pc tariff on Indian goods, to be imposed in 21 days, over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
 


“Reciprocal tariffs take effect at midnight tonight!” Trump said on Truth Social just ahead of the deadline.
“Billions of dollars, largely from countries that have taken advantage of the United States for many years, laughing all the way, will start flowing into the USA. The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail!”
Tariffs are ultimately paid by companies importing the goods and consumers of the end products.
Eight major trading partners accounting for about 40pc of US trade flows have reached framework deals for trade and investment concessions to Trump, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea, reducing their base tariff rates to 15pc.
Britain won a 10pc rate, while Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines secured rate reductions to 19pc or 20pc.
“For those countries, it’s less-bad news,” said William Reinsch, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
“There’ll be some supply chain rearrangement. There’ll be a new equilibrium. Prices here will go up, but it’ll take a while for that to show up in a major way,” Reinsch said.
Countries with punishingly high duties, such as India and Canada, “will continue to scramble around trying to fix this”, he added.
Switzerland’s government will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide its next move after President Karin Keller-Sutter returned home empty-handed from an 11th-hour trip to Washington aimed at averting the crippling US import tariff on Swiss goods.
A last-minute attempt by South Africa to improve its offer in exchange for a lower tariff rate also failed.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa held a telephone call with Trump on Wednesday and the two countries’ trade negotiating teams will have more talks, Ramaphosa’s office said.
 






Meanwhile, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told Reuters on Wednesday he wouldn’t humiliate himself by seeking a phone call with Trump even as he said his government would continue cabinet-level talks to lower a 50pc tariff rate on Brazilian exports to the US.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was similarly defiant, saying he would not compromise the interests of the country’s farmers after Trump introduced a 50pc tariff on Indian goods.
Trump’s order has specified that any goods determined to have been transshipped from a third country to evade higher US tariffs will be subject to an additional 40pc import duty, but his administration has released few details on how these goods would be identified or the provision enforced.

Revenues, price hikes
US import taxes are one part of a multilayered tariff strategy that includes national security-based sectoral tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, autos, steel, aluminium, copper, lumber and other goods.
Trump said on Wednesday the microchip duties could reach 100pc.
China is on a separate tariff track and will face a potential tariff increase on August 12 unless Trump approves an extension of a prior truce after talks last week in Sweden.
He has said he may impose additional tariffs over China’s purchases of Russian oil as he seeks to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Trump has touted a vast increase in federal revenues from his import tax collections, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying tariff revenues could top $300 billion a year.
The move will drive average US tariff rates to around 20pc, the highest in a century and up from 2.5pc when Trump took office in January, the Atlantic Institute estimates.
Commerce Department data released last week showed more evidence that tariffs began driving up US prices in June, including for home furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods and motor vehicles.
Costs from Trump’s tariff war are mounting for a wide swath of companies, including bellwethers Caterpillar, Marriott, Molson Coors and Yum Brands.
Toyota on Thursday said it expected a hit of nearly $10bn from tariffs on cars imported into the US as it cut its full-year profit forecast by 16pc.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07164331d41c39d.png?r=164418' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929328/pmd-issues-heavy-rain-warning-for-azad-kashmir-and-kp' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues heavy rain warning for Azad Kashmir and KP</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In a post on X, the PMD said at 3:30pm that a “rain-bearing weather system” was forming in the Poonch, Bagh, Haveli and Sudhnoti areas of Kashmir.
According to the post, the system was likely to cause “heavy rain with strong winds and thunderstorms” during the next 2-5 hours in the above-mentioned areas as well as Azad Kashmir’s Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Rawalakot, Bhimber, Mirpur and Neelum Valley.
 






Other areas that could come under the rain spell were KP’s Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur and Kohistan, along with Murree, Galyat, and surrounding areas.
The PMD has advised the public to take precautions and stay updated.
At least 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across KP since the start of the monsoon season in late June, according to the latest figures by KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
On Sunday, the nationwide death toll from monsoon rains rose to 299, up from 234, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
On Saturday, the PMD forecast more rain, with wind-thundershowers in the upper and central regions of the country over this week. The department asked provincial disaster management authorities and district administrations to take preventative measures against possible urban flooding.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617761-pm-seeks-national-policy-to-address-challenges-posed-by-rising-population' target='_blank'><strong>PM seeks national policy to address challenges posed by rising population</strong></a><br><p>

With the bill’s approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.
“The House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,” the NA’s official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.
As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.
 






“The legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,” Qamar, chairman of the NA’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.
“[…] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,” Qamar noted.
On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.
The Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill
The PPP government made the first attempt to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the second attempt in 2021.
The PML-N government had also discussed the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.
In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.
 
 

The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country’s strategic interests.
The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.
The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.
Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.
High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071513161f99a9b.jpg?r=152333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929316/550-point-gain-helps-psx-maintain-record-setting-spree' target='_blank'><strong>550-point gain helps PSX maintain record-setting spree</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its record-setting spree for a fifth consecutive session as it gained over 550 points on Thursday.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 992.53 points (0.68 per cent) to reach an intraday high of 146,081.02 points at 12:37pm, from the previous close of 145,088.49 points.
However, the shares soon declined slightly, standing at 145,613.09 points at 3:09pm, gaining 524.60 points (0.36pc) from yesterday. Witnessing fluctuations throughout the day, the index finally closed at 145,647.13 points, gaining 558.64 (0.39pc) from yesterday.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “Investor interest in companies posting strong corporate results or anticipated to report robust profitability has propelled the index to a new record high.
 
 

“Additionally, the recent imposition of an additional 25pc tariff on India has further bolstered market sentiment,” he added, referring to the United States’ recent levy on New Delhi, which will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc.
Commenting on the stock market’s future, Ashraf said: “We expect the KSE-100 to reach 165,215 [points] by December 25, supported by sustained earnings growth, declining fixed income yields, and a relatively stable rupee.”
Reacting yesterday to the PSX’s record-setting spree, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted it was a “reflection of investors’ confidence in government policies”.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617757-jirga-head-confesses-to-killing-woman-himself-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Jirga head confesses to killing woman himself in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

The summit would be the first between sitting United States and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021, and comes as Trump seeks to broker an end to Russia’s military assault on Ukraine.
Three rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv have failed to yield any progress towards a ceasefire, with the two sides appearing far apart in their demands to end the more than three-year-long conflict.
Trump said on Wednesday he was likely to meet Putin face-to-face “very soon”.
“At the suggestion of the American side, an agreement has been reached in principle to hold a bilateral summit in the coming days,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov was quoted as saying on Thursday by Russian state news agencies.
“We are now starting to work out the details together with our American colleagues,” Ushakov said.
The Kremlin said a venue had been agreed “in principle”, but did not indicate where the summit could take place.
“Next week has been set as a target date,” Ushakov added.
Zelensky calls for meeting
Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia launched its military offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.
Russian bombardments have forced millions for flee their homes and destroyed swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine.
Putin has resisted multiple calls from the United States, Europe and Kyiv for a ceasefire.
 
 

At talks in Istanbul, Russian negotiators have outlined hardline territorial demands if Ukraine wants Russia to halt its advance — calling for Kyiv to withdraw from territory it still controls and renounce Western military support.
Moscow has also repeatedly sought to cast doubt on Zelensky’s legitimacy and ruled out a meeting between the two leaders until after the terms of a peace deal have been agreed.
The announcement of the upcoming summit comes a day after US envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow.
Witkoff proposed a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but Russia did not respond to that proposal, Ushakov said.
“The Russian side left this option completely without comment,” he added.
Zelensky earlier on Thursday had refreshed his call for a meeting with Putin — which he says is the only way to make progress towards peace.
“We in Ukraine have repeatedly said that finding real solutions can be truly effective at the level of leaders,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
“It is necessary to determine the timing for such a format and the range of issues to be addressed,” he added.
 






The Ukrainian leader said on Thursday morning that he had planned to hold “several” conversations throughout the course of the day, including with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz as well as French and Italian officials.
“There will also be communication at the level of national security advisors,” Zelensky added.
“The main thing is for Russia, which started this war, to take real steps to end its aggression,” Zelensky added.</p><small>2025-08-07 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617751-lawyers-assault-techpreneur-zia-chishti-in-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Techpreneur Zia Chishti 'assaulted by lawyers' in IHC</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
“The blast was caused by a remote-controlled explosive device planted near a police vehicle [in the Rustam Bazaar],” Deputy Superintendent of Police Imranullah was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
Data from the incident report from the Wana District Headquarters Hospital showed two dead with 12 people with major injuries and eight with minor injuries.
A list of casualties issued by South Waziristan police spokesperson Anayat Khan identified two wounded policemen as Zubair Salaam Khan from the district’s Dabkot area and Fareedun Zubair from Birmal tehsil.
 
 

Lower South Waziristan’s District Police Officer (DPO) Tahir Khan had earlier told Dawn.com: “The wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital.”
Security forces cordoned off the area after the blast and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.
Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.
The incident follows residents’ complaints of the open display of firearms and the free movement of armed men in Wana’s Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.
Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.
Pakistan witnessed a slight uptick in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.
A day ago, a police constable was among two people injured when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle came under attack in the district’s Ladha tehsil.
Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among seven people martyred in two separate firing incidents in KP’s Karak and Peshawar districts.
 
 

On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.
Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were killed in a clash between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan’s Birmal tehsil.
Cop injured as late-night attack on Bannu police post repulsed
Separately, a cop was injured as police and civilians repulsed a late-night terrorist attack on the Khuni Khel police post in KP’s Bannu district.
“Police personnel responded strongly to the terrorist attack while showing bravery and determination,” Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi said in a statement.
“A policeman got injured by the terrorists’ firing and was taken to a hospital,” the officer added, noting that residents also joined the police and took up positions against the attackers.
DPO Kulachi stressed that the residents’ courage further heightened the police’s courage. “The net around the terrorists is being tightened,” he asserted.
According to APP, the assault was carried out using both light and heavy weaponry by terrorists from the outlawed TTP and Tehreek-i-Jihad Afghanistan (TTG), operating under the combined name Al-Ittihad al-Mujahideen.
 
 

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in July.
Last week, a fire exchange following a terrorist attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu left a constable and three terrorists dead, while three cops were injured.
Bannu has also seen multiple quadcopter attacks over the past month, which the military says are carried out by the TTP.</p><small>2025-08-07 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617741-at-least-seven-injured-as-fire-engulfs-factory-in-karachis-landi' target='_blank'><strong>At least eight injured as fire engulfs factory in Karachi's Landhi</strong></a><br><p>
