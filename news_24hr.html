Lt Gen Chaudhry is addressing a press conference alongside the interior secretary in Islamabad.
He said in 2009, the Pakistani government had handed a dozier of irrefutable evidence to then Indian prime minister.
“The publicly disclosed documents that were released in 2010 are part of history.”
In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the name of Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,“ he said.
“Then in 2019, a dozier full of evidence was presented to the United Nations.
Very recently, the international media has seen self giving confession and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this Fitna al Hindustan.
“This is what happened on May 21 on the orders of Hindustan, done by the terrorists of fitnah Al Hindustan,” he said referring to the attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in Balochistan.
“Is there any humanity, morality, any Baloch or Pakistani identity in this?”
“In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar on the early morning on May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children of our future resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.
Let me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, on our education and the very fabric of our society.“
The DG ISPR said: “On behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies are looking into all of this dastardly attack.”
He said initial findings confirm that this attack is a continuity of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitna al Hindustan operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency RAW.
“Having miserably failed in Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed . Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the preparators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.”
He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, Fitna al Hindustan has resorted to hitting soft targets wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.
“Much against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted.
I assure you that the State in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus will defeat them.
These Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have … commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decided. They will not succeed.“
The DG ISPR said that India was “planning and instructing” the terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, adding that the funding for the activities was also provided by India.
He continued that the attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India’s provocation.</p><small>2025-05-23 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2314181204659d8.jpg?r=144738' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912826/aseefa-world-bank-officials-hand-over-home-ownership-papers-to-flood-hit-families' target='_blank'><strong>Aseefa, World Bank officials hand over home ownership papers to flood-hit families</strong></a><br><p>Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the youngest daughter of President Asif Ali Zardari, on Friday visited a flood rehabilitation housing project in Shaheed Benazirabad district of Sindh accompanying a delegation of officials from the World Bank.
The WB officials included its managing director Anna Bejerde and country director Najy Benhassine. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also accompanied them as they visited the flood rehabilitation housing project in Nazar Muhammad Laghari village in Shaheed Benazirabad district.
This project, under the Sindh Peoples Housing for Flood Affectees (SPHF) programme, aims at rebuilding homes destroyed by the 2022 devastating floods, said a statement by the CM House.
During the visit, Aseefa and Bejerde distributed ownership rights certificates to women homeowners, and interacted with female members of the Village Reconstruction Committee, as the latter showcased their handicraft work. The committee was briefed that 32 homes were destroyed in the village and had now been rebuilt.
 






Bejerde reaffirmed the Bank’s commitment to supporting the Sindh government in flood recovery efforts, praising the resilience of the local people and the leadership’s dedication.
She emphasised that sustainable community-level rehabilitation is achievable despite climate change challenges.
Aseefa highlighted that granting women ownership rights under the SPHF project is a historic socio-economic empowerment initiative by the Sindh government, significantly benefitting rural women.
The Sindh chief minister noted that over 2.4 million homes were destroyed in the 2022 floods. He said the Bank initially provided $500m to kick start the recovery, later increasing funding by $450m over two years. Murad said this assistance helped construct 778,000 homes, and allocate $54.92m for water, sanitation, and hygiene, benefitting 66,691 families in 1,000 villages.
SPHF CEO Khalid Mahmood Sheikh informed them that 104,822 homes were destroyed in Shaheed Benazirabad; about 60,000 are under construction, while nearly 40,000 are completed.
He said across Sindh, over 111,000 disabled people are receiving accessible homes, and more than 800,000 women have opened bank accounts for the first time, thereby promoting financial inclusion. He elaborated that the programme provides safe shelter to over six million people and creates more than a million new jobs.
They later also visited the Basic Health Unit Jam Sahib in Shaheed Benazirabad.
 






Earlier this month, Aseefa distributed ownership documents of houses to flood-hit people in Mirza Farrukh Baig village of Daur taluka.
Accompanied by Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, she visited the village and met womenfolk of the flood-hit families. She sat with some of the families in their newly-built houses and inquired about their problems.
Aseefa distributed ownership documents of the houses among female beneficiaries of the free residential project. The women apprised her of their issues which she assured that would be resolved.
“I have come here on behalf of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to give you the ownership documents … now you have your own roof with the ownership rights … I have fulfilled the promise made to you by my grandfather and former prime minister Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-23 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605818-field-marshal-munir-pcc-ceo-discuss-digital-future-at-ghq' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir, PCC CEO discuss digital future at GHQ</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by the CTD read that it conducted an IBO to arrest the terrorists.
However, the terrorists opened fire on the police.
In an exchange of fire, the terrorist killed three of their own while the remaining six escaped.
The police found rifles, three hand grenades, bullets and explosives on the slain terrorists.
A search operation was underway to arrest the terrorists who had escaped, the statement said, adding that the teams had set up a blockade near Rehmanikhel.
The process of identifying the slain terrorists was underway, the statement continued.
It added that the terrorists who were targeted had completed their planning for carrying out major attacks on police posts.
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police, in a statement, said that unidentified miscreants carried out “unsuccessful attacks” on Fatehkhel chowki in Bannu district and Takia post in Bara tehsil of Khyber district, adding that both attacks were repelled by the police’s immediate response.
A young man was injured in an exchange of fire in Bannu, the statement said.
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police foiled the attacks with professionalism and courage, adding that the evil elements in society will be brought to their end.
“The soldiers showed great devotion to duty by remaining alert,” IG Hameed said, adding that the morale of the youth was high and they were determined to continue the struggle until terrorism was eradicated.
The IG paid tribute to the bravery of KP police and announced cash rewards and certificates of appreciation.
In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the forces for foiling the attack on a police post in Bannu and the killing of three terrorists in Mianwali.
He said that the Bannu police personnel bravely confronted the terrorists and foiled the attack.
He congratulated KP Police personnel for foiling the nefarious intentions of the terrorists, emphasising that the KP police were fighting the war against terrorism with courage.
The country “is proud of the brave sons of the KP police”, Naqvi said.
Speaking about the Mianwali incident, Naqvi said that CTD personnel bravely fought the terrorists.
Naqvi said he was proud of the CTD’s professional skills, adding that the team deserved praise for bringing down the terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Earlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on Friday on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p><small>2025-05-23 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605815-dg-ispr-lt-gen-chaudhry-addressing-presser' target='_blank'><strong>Govt vows decisive action against Fitna al-Hindustan after Khuzdar attack</strong></a><br><p>

The summit marked a historic milestone in her pursuit of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Mingma G, famous Nepali climber and the owner of Imagine Nepal, said that Kiani stood at top of the peak at 6am local time (5:15 am PKT).
Mingma G added  that after the successful summit, the expedition team started their descent to camp four and were heading towards basecamp.
Secretary Alpine Club of Pakistan, Karrar Haidri, congratulated Kiani for the feat.
According to press release issued by Kiani’s team, the achievement cemented her place not only in Pakistan’s mountaineering history but also on the global stage, etching closer to a rare and elite global record: becoming one of fewer than 20 women in history to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000m peaks.
It said that the summit push began at approximately 6:30pm on Thursday and continued through the night in severe high-altitude conditions, including intense snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.
“Despite the challenges, Kiani safely reached the summit, driven by unshakable determination and the support of a nation behind her,” the statement said.
“From Pakistan to Kanchenjunga, this summit is not just a personal milestone, it’s a message to every girl and woman in Pakistan and beyond: you are stronger than you think,” Naila said during her descent, according to the statement.
“I’m proud and grateful, but the journey has just started. Pakistan, this is for you.”
Before starting the summit push, through a message to her team, Kiani had said, “Climbing Kanchenjunga has been an incredibly difficult expedition and a harsh reminder of how hard it is to climb mountains over 8,000m.”
Kiani has already summited 11 out of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu.
“Kanchenjunga is known for its treacherous terrains and unpredictable weather,” she added.
“But with determination and the support of my family, team and followers, I’m hopeful for a successful summit.”
Kiani has a bunch of mountaineering feats to her name.
Earlier this month, Kiani became the first Pakistani woman to summit 11 8,000m peaks in the world.
In April last year, she became the first Pakistani woman to climb Nepal’s Annapurna peak, the world’s 10th-highest peak, standing 8,091m tall. The next month, she went on to summit Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, becoming the second Pakistani woman to do so.
In July, Kiani attained the feat of becoming the first Pakistani woman to climb the world’s ninth-highest peak, the 8,125m Nanga Parbat. The same month, she became the first Pakistani woman to summit Broad Peak, the world’s 12th-highest mountain at 8,051m.
Months later, Kiani and Sirbaz Khan became the first Pakistani duo to summit the 8,201m Cho Oyu, the world’s sixth-highest peak in China’s Tibet.</p><small>2025-05-23 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605774-pia-to-launch-weekly-direct-flights-to-paris-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to launch weekly direct flights to Paris next month</strong></a><br><p>

The talks, which began in April, are the highest-level contact between the foes since the United States quit the 2015 nuclear accord during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, backing talks but warning of military action if diplomacy fails.
Iran wants a new deal that would ease sanctions which have battered its economy.
The last round of talks, in the Omani capital Muscat, ended with a public spat over enrichment.
US envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington “could not authorise even one per cent” enrichment — a position Tehran called a red line, citing its rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
‘Fundamental differences’
Ahead of Friday’s talks, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “fundamental differences” remained with the United States, while adding that Tehran was open to its nuclear sites undergoing more inspections.
“We will not have an agreement at all if the United States wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium,” Araghchi added.
Friday’s talks in the Italian capital come ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the October expiry of the 2015 accord.
The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aimed to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb — a goal Western countries accused it of pursuing, though Tehran denies it.
 
 

In return for curbs on its nuclear programme, Iran had received relief from international sanctions. But the accord was torpedoed in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States.
Iran responded by ramping up its nuclear activities.
It is now enriching uranium to 60pc — far above the deal’s 3.67pc cap but below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade material.
‘It’s quite simple’
Experts in Tehran said Iran was unlikely to back down.
“It’s quite simple; if the US expects Iran to halt nuclear enrichment, then there can’t be a deal,” said Mohammad Marandi, a political scientist who was once an adviser on the nuclear issue.
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran says the country’s nuclear industry employs 17,000 people, similar to other countries where uranium is enriched for civilian use.
 
 

“The Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil, and Japan enrich (uranium) without possessing nuclear weapons,” its spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said.
Iran’s enmity with Israel, whose main backer is the United States, has been a constant backdrop to the talks.
In a letter to the United Nations, Araghchi wrote: “We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime, the US government will also be involved and bear legal responsibility.”
The warning came after CNN, citing unnamed US officials, reported Israel was making preparations to carry out such a strike.
The White House said Trump had a “productive discussion” with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday about Iran and the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington.
‘Irreversible’
Friday’s talks will be held before an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in June in Vienna during which Iran’s nuclear activities will be reviewed.
The 2015 deal provides for the possibility of UN sanctions being reimposed through a mechanism called “snapback” if Iran fails to fulfil its commitments.
The agreement’s three European signatories — Britain, France and Germany — have warned they would trigger the mechanism if the continent’s security was threatened.
 
 

Iran’s top diplomat Araghchi said such a move would have “consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible”.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/231011036d3679d.jpg?r=101131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912791/pakistan-rubbishes-indian-pm-modis-bid-to-link-islamabad-with-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi’s bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations” made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.
The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
Yesterday, the Indian premier said that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.
According to a statement issued by the FO on X today, “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.
 






“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,” the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.
“Resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” the FO said.
“This dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,” it added.
The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a “consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism”.
“Any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,” it continued.
It noted that the Indian premier’s tactic was “often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges”, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its “serious human rights violations” in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.
“The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.”
Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to “exercise responsibility and restraint”, the FO said.
“Escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,” the FO noted.
It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to “peaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement”.
“However, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,” it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were “fully prepared and capable of defending the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“Any misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,” the FO added.
It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.
“The international community must take serious note of India’s aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,” it said, adding that it was “imperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia”.
“Glorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,” it concluded.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23102705aec89f7.jpg?r=102725' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912792/unsc-condemns-heinous-cowardly-terrorist-attack-on-school-bus-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC condemns ‘heinous, cowardly’ terrorist attack on school bus in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned “in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly” terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar earlier this week.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad would present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on the school bus.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the UNSC condemned the “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” on a school bus in Khuzdar in the strongest terms.
In a press release, the UNSC said that the “reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss”, with its members expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government.
“They [UNSC members] wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” it added.
The council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”, underlining the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.
It urged all states to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan, reiterating that any acts of terrorism were criminal and unjustifiable.

• Respondents highlight inflation, taxation, inconsistent policies, rupee devaluation as key threats
ISLAMABAD: The latest survey conducted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has shown marked improvement in business confidence over the country’s economic and business outlook.
The OICCI released the results of its Business Confidence Index (BCI) Wave 27 survey that depicted a significant improvement in the overall business confidence, which improved by 16 percentage points to positive 11 per cent from negative 5pc in the previous wave conducted in October-November 2024.
This is the first time in nearly three years that business confidence has ente­red positive territory. The last time the index was in the green was in May 2022, when it stood at 17pc. Since then, it had remained negative, registering -4pc, -25pc, -18pc, -14pc, and -5pc in subsequent waves.
The survey was conducted by the US firm AC Nielsen across Pakistan in March and April 2025, before the period of a recent standoff with India. The positive shift in sentiment across various sectors of the economy can largely be attributed to macroeconomic stability, declining inflation, and anticipated improvements in business conditions over the next six months.
 
 

The manufacturing sector led the recovery in the overall business confidence, improving from negative 3pc to positive 15pc, followed by the retail/wholesale sectors, which rose from negative 18pc in the previous Wave 26 to positive 2pc in the latest survey, showing an overall improvement of 20pc. The services sector maintained a steady outlook and jumped from 2pc to 10pc positive in Wave 27, an overall improvement of 12pc.
“The uptick in business confidence is a clear sign that our economic direction is on the right track,” said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who was given a briefing on the latest survey, on Thursday.
“We are focused on creating a conducive environment for investment, supporting private sector growth, and ensuring long-term macroeconomic resilience. The improved sentiment among businesses is both encouraging and a validation of our collective efforts,” he said.
Speaking at a news conference, OICCI President Yousaf Hussain said overall business confidence had shown a notable improvement over the past two years across the business community.
“This sharp recovery in the Business Confidence in the latest Wave 27 reflects the resilience of Pakistan’s business sector and its readiness to seize emerging growth opportunities”, he said, adding that it was heartening to see positive momentum across key sectors, which reflects improved sentiment and growing trust in the country’s economic direction.
He called for greater policy consistency, transparency and active engagement with the key stakeholders including OICCI members to maintain this growing positivity in the business confidence.
The BCI Wave 27 survey revealed increased optimism for the next six months, with 45pc of the respondents expressing positive expectations. Key contributors to this positive outlook include economic growth, improved government policies, investment climate and security situation, said OICCI Chief Executive Abdul Aleem.
Despite the positive trend, 53pc of the survey respondents reported a negative outlook on business conditions over the past six months, which is also a substantial improvement from 66pc negative sentiments in Wave 26. The key concerns indicated in the survey related to political stability, rupee-foreign exchange parity, energy and trade policies.
Foreign investors, including randomly selected OICCI members, showed a remarkable increase from positive 6pc to 17pc. This improvement was primarily attributed to a better global business climate, an improved industry environment in Pakistan over the past six months, and expectations of increased capital investment in the coming six months.
Mr Aleem said the latest survey results were better than anticipated, with positive expectations reflected across all major sectors. Employment prospects, expansion plans and investment expectations demonstrated notable gains, particularly in the manufacturing and retail sectors.
Despite notable improvement on the overall BCI, Mr Aleem said that the new investment plans overall showed an improvement of 19pc, but remained negative, which is an area of concern and needs to be addressed to further accelerate economic growth, energise large-scale manufacturing, trade and export.
Looking ahead, the BCI Wave 27 respondents highlighted inflation, taxation, inconsistent government policies and rupee devaluation as the key threats in order of priority. The top two concerns remain unchanged from the previous wave, indicating ongoing challenges in these areas.
The survey is conducted twice a year and reflects the views of major business stakeholders representing nearly 80pc of Pakistan’s GDP.
The survey covers responses from various sectors, including manufacturing, services, retail and wholesale, and assesses perceptions at regional, national and business entity levels.
Face-to-face interviews are held across major business centres of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Peshawar.

The South Asian nation of some 170 million people has been in political turmoil since a student-led revolt forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee in August 2024. But this week has seen an escalation in political crisis with rival parties protesting on the streets of the capital Dhaka with a string of competing demands.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who leads the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections, told his cabinet he wanted to quit if political parties did not give him their full support, a source inside his office said.
“He wanted to tender his resignation, but his cabinet members persuaded him not to”, the source said.
Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party — made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina — met with Yunus on Thursday evening, another top NCP leader Ariful Islam Adeeb said. “They spoke about the current political situation”, Adeeb said.
“The chief adviser said he is reconsidering whe­ther he can continue his duties under the current circumstances”. But Nahid Islam — who had initially been part of Yunus’s cabinet before resigning to form a political party —  “urged him to remain in office”, Adeeb said.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist party, has urged Yunus to call an all-party meeting to address the crisis, a party official said. Yunus’s reported threat to stand down comes a day after thousands of supporters of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rallied in Dhaka, holding large-scale protests against the interim government for the first time.

If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.
 






The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan’s social media handler.
The PTI founder said it would have been more app­ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‘king’ as Pakistan was being run according to the ‘law of the jungle’. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, “there is only one king”.
The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. “I request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,” he said.
Dawn.com quoted him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. “This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,” he told reporters outside the jail as per Dawn.com.

“We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,” he added.
PTI leader’s sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.
“We have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,” she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was “a law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king”, she added.
Earlier this week, the federal cabinet approved the promotion of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‘Marka-i-Haq’.
‘No deal’
A post on Mr Khan’s X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.
The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.
It was “unfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law”.
The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.
It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.
As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi’s attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.
Gandapur’s IMF warning
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.
Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue “in the best interest of Pakistan”.
He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.
Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party’s founding chairman.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.
“Such oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan’s spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks…because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,” he claimed.
He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.

• Govt seeks relief measures in budget; Fund reviewing proposals
ISLAMABAD: Amid week-long talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on next fiscal year’s budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fast-track institutional reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability.
During a meeting with an IMF delegation led by Regional Director for the Middle East and South Asia, Jihad Azour, the prime minister said the country was now firmly on the path of economic development after a period of recovery and stability.
“By the grace of Allah, Pakistan is now moving from economic stability towards sustainable growth,” PM Shehbaz said in an official statement.
He said the government’s top priority was to sustain macroeconomic gains and expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The high-level meeting took place at the last leg of negotiations between an IMF staff mission and Pakistan’s economic team to finalise next year’s budget in line with commitments made as part of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).
The Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.
The engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.
Sources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.
However, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.
During the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.
PM meets WB team
Separately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.
He hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.
Ms Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.
Also appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.

Even while leverage is slipping from its hands, the party remains in two minds about whether it ought to negotiate a way out or continue on its path of ‘resistance’. It believes that “it is in Pakistan’s interest” for the state to engage with the PTI, but has never really explained what it is willing to concede in return. It is also quite unjustified to demand that politics be reduced to a zero-sum game between PTI on one side and all other parties on the other. To top it off, Imran Khan continues to maintain a frustrating ambiguity about his position on negotiations, even with the establishment. His remarks to confidantes, which often make their way to social media, seem to consistently undermine the work his own party leaders have been doing to start a dialogue. This chaotic approach has taken a toll on the party. Over time, the urgency for a negotiated settlement has gradually subsided, and the ruling regime has used its position to manufacture various new means of ensuring its continuity in power. Meanwhile, the PTI has been able to make little headway towards its goals.
At some point, the party should have reconsidered whether its approach was the right one. While the government may be unpopular with the public, and its legitimacy may continue to remain in doubt, its legislative measures have now ensured that it would be difficult to dislodge it. Indeed, the country has paid, and continues to pay, a steep price for maintaining the status quo, and it is in the nation’s long-term interest that a political ceasefire is reached soon. Things must return to normal. Unfortunately, the appetite for ‘normalcy’ appears to be running out, and the ‘power is power’ doctrine has been gaining in force. But while it is still by and large the PTI that is on the losing end today, the backward slide does not bode well for Pakistani democracy in general. In the absence of defined rules of the game, the political class remains at the mercy of non-political forces and their agendas. It is better for the different parties to work out a modus vivendi based on fair principles and mutual respect than to resign themselves to playing second fiddle in policymaking and governance.

• House passes resolution urging govt to condemn India for suspending Indus Waters Treaty
ISLAMABAD: Days before presentation of the federal budget for the next fiscal year, the National Assembly on Thursday passed an IMF-dictated money bill through a supplementary agenda and without any debate.
The Off the Grid (Captive Power Plants) Levy Bill, 2025, aimed at providing legal justification for the grid levy imposed on the supply of natural gas or imported liquefied natural gas to industrial captive power plants (CPPs) as of March 7, was tabled by Minister for Petroleum Division Ali Pervaiz after the house suspended the rules.
The minister moved the motion for the passage of the bill soon after presentation of the report of the standing committee on petroleum by its chairman Mustafa Mehmood. The bill cleared all the required stages in just one day as the committee had also approved it in a meeting held minutes before start of the NA session.
The opposition challenged the ruling of the chair on the motion allowing the minister to present the bill for passage, but faced a 99-44 vote defeat after the headcount.
Earlier on May 17, the NA had passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024.
According to an official handout, during the meeting of the NA Standing Committee on Petroleum on Thursday morning, the petroleum minister gave a detailed briefing on the bill, highlighting its significance as part of Pakistan’s commitments under the International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility.
He noted that while the phase-out of captive power generation had long been under consideration, its implementation had been delayed due to prolonged political and economic constraints.
The minister emphasised that transitioning industries from captive power systems to the national grid was intended to optimise surplus electricity generation, improve efficiency in the power sector, and relieve financial pressures on the economy.
The minister informed the committee that a comprehensive consultation process had been completed in drafting the bill and acknowledged the instrumental role played by the NA speaker in facilitating this process.
He assured the committee that the bill was aimed at serving public interest without disrupting industrial operations and that protections for the industrial sector had been incorporated. He also highlighted high electricity prices as a major concern and underscored the need to fulfill public demand through grid supply.
It may be recalled that the government had already enforced the law through an ordinance and in March it had notified an increase in gas rates for industrial CPPs by about 23pc and scale down temptation for a substantial cut in power rates to get the policy negotiations going with the IMF in March this year.
Since the ordinance was about to complete its constitutional life, it was necessary for the government to get its approval from the National Assembly. Since it was a money bill, it was not required to be passed by the Senate.
However, the Senate committee on finance, which was only required to give recommendations to the NA, approved it without making any recommendations on May 16.
Resolution
Besides this, the National Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution calling on the government to strongly condemn India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), terming it a clear violation of the agreement and an “act of war.”
The resolution was presented by Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo after a brief debate on the matter before the chair, Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP, read out prorogation order of the president, thus announcing the end of the summer session which had begun on May 5.
In their speeches, the lawmakers criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for suspending the treaty and accused him of acting with a hostile mindset.
The lawmakers also condemned the school bus attack in Khuzdar, blaming India for supporting the attackers.
Earlier, the proceedings of the assembly remained suspended for few minutes during the Question Hour when PTI Iqbal Afridi pointed out lack of quorum.

• Senate panel slams India’s ‘provocative action’
NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to suspend a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.
The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islam­abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.
The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.
New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den­ied and the nuclear-armed neig­hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.
“Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack … Pakistan’s army will pay it, Pakistan’s economy will pay it,” Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.
 
 

The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan’s finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have “any immediate impact”.
The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters that Pakistan is “willing to talk about or to address anything”.
He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.
The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.
The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.
“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS.
“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.
Senate committee
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.
The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.
The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.
He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.
The committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.
“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.
It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement could not be held in abeyance by one party and continued.
“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”
The members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.
This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.
The committee also condemned India’s attack on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.
“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.
The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.
“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”
The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
However, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.

“PIA has decided to operate a weekly flight from Lahore to Paris every Wednesday,” a spokesman for PIA said. “With the launch of this flight, three direct flights per week will become part of PIA’s operations.”
The new route is part of the airline’s broader strategy to extend its network to Europe and meet growing demand from the Pakistani diaspora in France and Pakistan, the spokesman said.
“This direct route to Paris addresses a long-standing demand from the Pakistani community, offering affordable fares and time savings,” the spokesman added.
Earlier this year, to mark the relaunch of PIA flights from Islamabad to Paris, the airline decorated a Boeing 777 aircraft with a model of the Eiffel Tower on its tail and the slogan “I Love Paris” on the nose. The aircraft was modified to meet European Union aviation standards.
PIA had also previously introduced a wireless in-flight entertainment system on the Islamabad-Paris route, allowing passengers to access entertainment on their personal devices.

Titled, ‘Action on Armed Violence’ (AOAV), the report notes that the casualties in 2024 represent a nine per cent decrease from 2023.  However, there was a 11 per cent increase in incidents compared to 218 in 2023. Pakistan was listed at seventh position among the 15 most affected countries and territories in 2024.
The majority of civilians harmed was attributed to non-state actors, who were reported responsible for 76pc of civilian casualties.  In particular, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) killed and injured 119 civilians in Pakistan last year.
 
 

The BLA is among the biggest non-state users of explosive weapons in 2024, and it was the reported perpetrator of 15pc civilian casualties, marking a 440pc increase from 22 incidents recorded in 2023. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 54pc of civilian casualties (423), down from 541 recorded civilian casualties in 2023.
All suicide bombings in the country were carried out by non-state actors, most notably, of the known non-state actors, were the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), who were responsible for 2pc of all 9 incidents, but 89pc (92) of civilian casualties resulting from suicide bombings. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 6pc (5) of incidents, and 11pc of civilian casualties.
Overall, 2024 saw the highest number of recorded incidents in Pakistan since 2014, and the second highest number of civilian casualties since 2018, and the second highest number of armed actor casualties since 2015.

Trump is furious at Harvard, which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners, for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
“Effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor (Sevis) Programme certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States.
Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision.
“As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enrol foreign students,” Noem wrote.
“All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme regulations, to maintain this privilege,” she said.
“As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies, you have lost this privilege.”
More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.
Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-05-22 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2223145405dc4e1.jpg?r=231621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912641/man-two-sons-gunned-down-in-kps-mardan-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Man, two sons gunned down in KP’s Mardan: authorities</strong></a><br><p>A man and his two sons were shot dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, police and rescue officials said on Thursday, adding that the five suspects had fled the scene.
Rescue 1122 Mardan spokesperson Mohammad Abbas Shah told Dawn.com that the incident took place on Wednesday and that a case was registered at Shahbaz Garhi police station on the complaint of the victim’s sister.
“Five suspects opened fire on the victims, Qubad Khan and his sons, in a field in the Gariala area of Mardan,” Shah said. “The victim and his young sons died at the scene, while women nearby were able to narrowly escape.”
He added that the suspects were able to flee the scene after the incident.
According to the police report, seen by Dawn.com, the suspects were charged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 302 (punishment for murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Earlier this week, six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Seven people were reported to have been shot in the exchange of fire between two families, six of whom died on the spot.
The deceased have been identified as Fazl Amin, Hazrat Amin, Ahmed, along with three women. Another woman was reported to be critically injured and has been shifted to Lady Reading Hospital.</p><small>2025-05-22 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/222235216763435.jpg?r=223607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912638/bangladeshs-interim-govt-undermining-freedoms-rights-group' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s interim govt ‘undermining’ freedoms: rights group</strong></a><br><p>Human Rights Watch strongly criticised Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday, warning that it risked “undermining fundamental freedoms” through measures including its ban on the former ruling party.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that ousted then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with parties protesting on the streets over a string of demands.
The interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has promised democratic reforms and vowed polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.
However, New York-based HRW said Yunus risked following the example of Hasina in clamping down on opponents.
“Instead of pursuing its pledge to reform the criminal justice system and bring accountability for serious abuses, the government … is attempting to suppress the rights of supporters of the deposed leader,” the rights group said in a statement.
HRW said the government had used “newly introduced powers under a draconian amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act” to suppress Hasina’s party.
Hasina’s government was blamed for extensive human rights abuses and protesters demanded that Yunus take action.
The government banned Hasina’s Awami League party on May 12 after days of protests outside Yunus’s house, pending the trial of Hasina and other key leaders.
Hasina, 77, fled to India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
“Imposing a ban on any speech or activity deemed supportive of a political party is an excessive restriction on fundamental freedoms that mirrors the previous government’s abusive clampdown on political opponents,” HRW said.
“Hasina’s government abused legal powers to silence political opponents, but using similar methods against the supporters of her Awami League party would also violate those same fundamental freedoms,” said HRW’s Meenakshi Ganguly.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22224251d8f46b0.jpg?r=224622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912639/france-detains-55-men-in-child-sex-abuse-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>France detains 55 men in child sex abuse crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Fifty-five men, including a priest, a paramedic, and a music teacher, were arrested in France this week as part of an operation to dismantle a suspected paedophile ring operating via the Telegram messaging app, authorities said on Thursday.
The arrests took place in 42 departments over possession, distribution and regular viewing of pornography involving children “under the age of 10”, France’s OFMIN, which is tasked with preventing violence against minors, told AFP.
OFMIN issued the warrant that led to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in Paris in 2024, and he remains under formal investigation by French authorities over illegal content on the popular service.
The arrests of the 55 men aged 25 to 75, which followed a 10-month investigation, took place from Monday to Thursday.
The men exchanged messages on Telegram and were in contact with “extremely dangerous” child sex abusers who have been in prison since last summer, Quentin Bevan, head of OFMIN’s operational unit, told AFP.
The large-scale operation began last summer with the arrest of individuals suspected of abusing children and posting images on Telegram. The suspects are being investigated for human trafficking and face life imprisonment.
“It took 10 months of investigation to track down these child abusers,” Bevan said. “Ten months of undercover work involving thousands of exchanges, analysis and detection of paedophile images by a task force set up at the OFMIN.”
The suspects either have children or grandchildren, or come into contact with children at work. Some of the suspects boasted of abusing children while they slept, but now claim they did not actually commit any crimes, according to investigators.
‘Pedophile den’
In a separate case, Durov has been charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist content.
Investigators have confronted him with specific cases ranging from child abuse to drug trading, scams, arms sales and the hiring of hitmen.
The Russian-born entrepreneur has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris’s demands.
While Bevan acknowledged progress in Telegram’s cooperation with investigators since Durov’s arrest, he said the platform was “barely fulfilling its legal obligations”.
He said that Telegram remains a “pedophile den” and a “platform of choice” for child abusers.
Telegram rejected the accusation in a statement on Thursday, saying that it “meets and exceeds its legal obligations to fight harmful content”.
The messaging platform has “always complied with EU law” and “consistently responded to all binding legal requests for years”, the company added.
Durov says Telegram has also sought to fight against child abuse for years.
In June 2024, France shut down the adult website Coco which was used to commit numerous sex crimes such as child sex abuse and rape.
After that, some perpetrators of child sex abuse are believed to have switched to Telegram, according to an investigator.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22212742d719f5f.jpg?r=212925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912633/several-dead-as-plane-crashes-on-california-neighbourhood' target='_blank'><strong>Several dead as plane crashes on California neighbourhood</strong></a><br><p>Several people are feared dead after a small plane crashed into a California neighbourhood before dawn on Thursday, destroying homes and setting cars on fire.
At least 10 houses were burned or hit by debris that spread over a wide area, and cars on both sides of a street were set on fire when the Cessna 550 slammed into the ground in San Diego.
“There are more than one fatality that we found so far, but we’re waiting to get the registered numbers that were on the plane itself,” said San Diego’s Assistant Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy.
“When it hit the street, as the jet fuel went down, it took out every single car that was on both sides of the street,” he said, adding: “We have jet fuel all over the place.”
Footage of the immediate aftermath of the crash showed a line of burning fuel linking the flaming cars.
Eddy said “miraculously” no one on the ground had been killed or seriously hurt.
Daylight revealed what a close call it had been for some people, with images showing the roof of one home blackened and collapsing. Vehicles were twisted and charred, with one still burning.
“We have one car fire that just will not go out no matter what we put on it right now,” Eddy told reporters.
The accident happened in thick fog when the plane, which had come from Kansas, was nearing the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.
The plane, which can carry up to eight people, went down around 3:45am (1145 GMT, 4:45pm PKT), according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), striking the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood.
The residential area it hit is largely military housing. San Diego is home to US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases and Coast Guard stations.
Zane Baker, a high school senior who lives in the area, said police officers had gone door-to-door getting people out of their homes.
“I immediately just rushed to the front door, just looking outside, seeing what’s happening,” he told broadcaster KTLA. “I made sure all my siblings were awake and they were conscious and they were okay.”
Baker, who described himself as a “Navy rat” — the son of a servicemember — said scores of people had been evacuated from their homes, with many now milling around in confusion.
“The entirety of our parking lots and other areas are completely filled,” he said. “A lot of the entryways are blocked. People can’t get in or out. It’s a confusing mess.”
The accident came at a time of heightened tension in the skies above America, with a number of incidents rocking public confidence in flying.
Air traffic control outages have struck the busy Newark airport on the East Coast at least twice in recent weeks, and in January, there was a mid-air collision over Washington between a passenger plane and a military helicopter.
This month, two people who were onboard a small plane died when it crashed into a residential neighbourhood northwest of Los Angeles.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2219112938702db.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Army’s top brass vows to stop ‘externally-sponsored terrorists’ from destroying national peace: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country’s peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“A comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, a decisive chapter of Marka-i-Haq,” the statement read.
It was observed that “following its military failure in the wake of the Pahalgam incident, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,” the ISPR said.
“The forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.
“These hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.”
 
 

It further said that the nation will take “all measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests”.
The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing “deep concern” over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.
“[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,” the statement read. “[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.”
Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the “sacred blood of the shuhuda (martyrs)” would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan’s “media and information warriors” for their role during the brief conflict.
 


A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (Fitna al Hindustan)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.
President, PM present baton of field marshal to COAS Munir
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter’s promotion to the highest rank in the military.
The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under “Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998”.

The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.
After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, “Today is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
“You have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,” the PM said, addressing Munir.
“The aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.”
The PM said that the field marshal “led our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve”. He thanked Munir for “his command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“The nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,” he added. “He not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.”

President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression”.
“The entire nation is proud of all of you,” he said.
The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton “in recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character”.
“Your military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,” Zardari said. “Throughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.”</p><small>2025-05-22 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22211604a7e9923.jpg?r=211644' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912629/punjab-launches-awareness-campaign-on-childrens-safety' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab launches awareness campaign on children’s safety</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Thursday launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children.
According to the spokesperson of the home department, the campaign called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’ was launched on the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister.
The statement said, “The home department released the first episode of a special animation series to create awareness about ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’.
“The campaign was launched to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors.”
The statement also said that the series introduced the characters named Haya and Bahadur, who educate children about “Good Touch and Bad Touch”, with a message for children stating, “We will not be afraid of those who touch us badly.”
Educating children about personal safety was the need of the hour, the statement said, adding that the series taught children about “appropriate and inappropriate physical behaviour in a positive way”.
With proper education and awareness, children can recognise and report inappropriate behaviour, it added.
It further said that parents and teachers must teach children how to report sexual abuse at home or outside.
The statement highlighted that children who face sexual abuse can be traumatised for life, saying, “It is the responsibility of the state to protect children and bring abusers to justice.”
The campaign will help protect children from abuse and sexual exploitation, it added.
According to the statement, the Punjab home secretary has directed the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau to conduct an awareness campaign for children.
The department had also written a letter to the Education Department to include ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’ awareness in the curriculum.
The awareness campaign has been designed to keep future generations safe, the statement said, adding, “Be a part of this awareness campaign to keep your children safe.”
Earlier this month, a civil society report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
A 17-year-old girl died by suicide in April after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh.
On Tuesday, the police arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore.</p><small>2025-05-22 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605701-president-zardari-confers-baton-of-field-marshal-upon-asim-munir' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM confer baton of field marshal upon COAS Asim Munir</strong></a><br><p>
