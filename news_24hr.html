The directive came as a larger bench, led by Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and including Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Azam Khan, collectively took up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders regarding Imran’s jail visitation. The ex-premier’s family and party have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
During the hearing, the IHC directed Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, who was present during the hearing, to allow Imran’s jail meetings, as per the earlier order, while abiding by standard operating procedures (SOPs).
It directed the jail official to facilitate the meetings as per the list provided by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who also presented arguments before the bench.
Petitions taken up by the bench included those by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, who attended the IHC hearing. Shortly after it concluded, his office said on X that he had departed for Adiala jail to attempt to meet Imran.
 






The court also heard a plea by the Punjab government seeking the implementation of the Pakistan Prison Rules of 1978, with Punjab Advocate General Amjad Pervaiz presenting arguments in the case. It also heard an appeal challenging the bar on political conversations during jail meetings.
Raja and Anjum also traded barbs as the PTI leader claimed that “not even once” was the earlier IHC order implemented despite them giving a list of names, while the jail official asserted that “regular meetings” were held, but no list was received.
At one point during the hearing, Rawalpindi police also made an appearance to have Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum sign a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for her in a case pertaining to the November 26 protest.

The 36-year-old off-spinner finished with 6-50, taking his 1,000th first-class wicket in the process, on a deteriorating Rawalpindi stadium pitch.
South Africa reached the 68-run target for the loss of captain Aiden Markram (42) and Tristan Stubbs (nought), both to spinner Noman Ali, who finished with 2-40.
Ryan Rickelton, who scored 25 not out, hit Sajid Khan for a six to seal an emphatic win minutes before the lunch break for the World Test Championship holders.
 






In another battle of spinners, Pakistan managed 333 in their first innings before the South African tail wagged to help them pile up 404 for a crucial 71-run lead.
Spinners took 34 of the 40 wickets to fall in the first Test in Lahore, which Pakistan won by 93 runs.
Thursday’s morning session saw Pakistan’s batters fold, adding just 44 runs after resuming the fourth day on 94-4.
Harmer torpedoed Pakistan’s hopes of saving the Test when he trapped Babar Azam leg-before with the fifth ball of the day after the batsman had reached his 30th Test half-century.
 






Pakistan’s hopes had rested on Azam ending his century drought, having not scored a ton since December 2022.
His lean spell goes on.
Nine runs later Harmer had Mohammad Rizwan caught by close-in fielder Tony de Zorzi for 18.
In his next over the spinner dismissed Noman for nought, caught behind for Harmer’s 1,000 wicket in his 235th first-class match.
Harmer is the fourth South African to take 1,000 or more first-class wickets, behind Mike Procter (1,417), Allan Donald (1,216) and Charlie Llewellyn (1013).
Harmer’s previous best figures of 4-51 came in the first Test in Lahore.
Unlike South Africa, Pakistan’s tail did not last long as they lost their last five wickets for just 33 runs in their second innings, just their latest batting slumps in the series.
Shaheen Shah Afridi was run out without scoring while Keshav Maharaj dismissed Salman Agha for 28 and Sajid Khan for 13 to swiftly wrap up the innings.
Maharaj finished with 2-34 to follow up his 7-102 in the first innings.
Shan backs policy of preparing slow test wickets
Pakistan captain Shan Masood gave a vote of confidence to his country’s controversial policy of preparing slow, spinning wickets for home tests, even after it backfired as they lost to South Africa.
Pakistan have deliberately looked to produce dry and deteriorating pitches for their spin bowlers to thrive on in home tests over the last 12 months against England, West Indies and South Africa a decision that has attracted some criticism.
“Look, it’s been four wins out of six since we’ve operated on these wickets,” he said.
“Obviously, the wickets have got a bit better. They’ve been much more battable. Four out of six isn’t bad considering in the two test matches we’ve lost we got into winning positions. Had we finished those games off it could easily have been six out of six.”
Critics of the Pakistan approach fear it holds back the development of their fast bowlers, and this would erode their competitiveness in away series.
“There is a lot to work on,” said Masood who has now lost ten of the 14 Test as skipper. “The lower order batting, finishing the innings of the opposition, and our third innings batting are not perfect.
“We had a great opportunity to close it out when we had a lead of 98 with two wickets to go but those last two wickets cost us dearly, putting us under a lot of pressure, and in these conditions it’s the difference between the first innings that leads into the third and fourth innings,” said Masood.
“We have a lot to work on when it comes to lower order batting, when it comes to finishing the innings off, when it comes to the third innings of batting, also when it comes to the first innings where we could have posted something north of 400, but we didn’t,” he added.
Pakistan spin lessons good for South Africa, says Markram
Skipper Markram says lessons learnt from the spin-dominated series will put South Africa in good stead for their tour of India next month.
Markram, standing in for injured skipper Temba Bavuma, praised his team’s fightback.
“After the first Test we were put under pressure and the guys have put their hands up and excelled,” said Markram.
“We have taken a lot of confidence from this win and we are in a great space to be in as a team, but we are still a work in progress in these conditions as we now head to India.”
Markram said his spin quartet was up to the challenge.
“The unit out here had quality spinners,” said Markram of Maharaj, Harmer, Senuran Muthusamy and Prenelan Subrayen — who between them took 35 of the 40 wickets in the series.</p><small>2025-10-23 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630095-kp-cm-afridi-reaches-adiala-jail-to-meet-imran-khan-after-ihc-order-to-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi reaches Adiala jail to meet Imran Khan after IHC order to authorities</strong></a><br><p>

“During the delegation-level talks, Minister Sikorski and I took stock of the Pakistan-Poland bilateral ties, which continue to develop on a very positive trajectory. We have over a billion-dollar bilateral trade and both sides agreed that there remains immense untapped potential to further expand trade and economic cooperation.
“We agreed to expand bilateral cooperation in trade, energy, infrastructure, defence, counter-terrorism, science and technology and education,” Dar said during a joint press conference with Poland’s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, who landed in Islamabad today on a two-day official visit.
Dar also announced that the foreign ministries of the two countries had signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) that envisioned regular bilateral consultations, which he said aimed at further enhancing cooperation between the two sides.
Moreover, he said an MoU had also been signed on cooperation between the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad and the Polish Institute of International Affairs.
At the outset of the press conference, Dar welcomed his Polish counterpart, mentioning that this was his second visit to Pakistan, the last being in 2011.
Moreover, he said, Sikorski was “no stranger in this part of the world”, having served as a war correspondent in the region during 1980s.
Dar underlined that Pakistan attached great importance to its ties with Poland.
“Poland’s struggle for freedom and independence is exemplary,” he said, further stating that Pakistan and Poland shared a “unique historical connection”.
“During World War II, thousands of Polish refugees found shelter in present-day Pakistan i.e. in Karachi and Quetta.”
He also recalled and lauded the role of Polish pilots and engineers in laying the foundation of the Pakistan Air Force.
Dar continued that with this shared historical context, Pakistan viewed Poland as an important partner, bilaterally, as well as in the European Union.
“We rejoice the economic progress Poland has made to now become a trillion-dollar economy,” he said, further congratulating the European country on the “successful and smooth presidential election and for its it able stewardship of the European Union”.
FM Dar further said that during the talks today, the two sides had exchanged views on major regional and global issues, including the security situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, Europe and the Middle East.
“I apprised the foreign minister of our concerns regarding unprovoked Indian aggression and Pakistan’s principled position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, advocating for the resolution according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and in line with UN Security Council resolutions.
“We also discussed the recent excess of the Taliban regime. Presence of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan elements on Afghan soil and their continued attacks against Pakistan remain our top concerns.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan are terms designated by the state for the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and terrorist organisations in Balochistan, respectively.
Dar said he had emphasised the need for “strengthening multilateralism and consistent adherence to the fundamental principles of the UN Charter to address the existing and emerging international challenges in an effective and credible manner”.
Concluding his speech, he said Sikorski’s visit to Pakistan was a “significant milestone” in relations between the two countries, saying, “Today, we reaffirm our resolve to transform these relations into a comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership.”
After Dar, the Polish foreign minister began his speech by thanking Dar for “reminding us of the shared historical legacy” between the two countries.
He confirmed that the two sides had agreed to renew the MoU between their foreign ministries to “facilitate better coordination”. He also welcomed the signing of an MoU between think tanks in the two countries.
Moving on to talks between the two sides, he said, “We have covered a broad range of issues, from bilateral economic ties […] to regional issues and global governance.
“During the talks with Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, I presented a […] offer of more intense bilateral collaborations in the fields of trade, public finances, fintech and water management. We also discussed further collaboration in the mining and the energy sector, building on the success of such engagements as the Polish Oil and Gas Company exploring natural in Pakistan. This, I believe, has huge potential for the future.”
Sikorski further said that the Pakistani diaspora in Poland had been growing over the past few years.
“It is still quite small, around 2,000 people, but I am glad to say a quarter of them are students. We are happy that Polish universities are popular among young, talented people from Pakistan, and we hope that their experience and impressions that they gather in Poland serve as a basis for actual people-to-people diplomacy.
“So Poland remains open to legal migration, and for real studies for real students. But I want to emphasise that there is zero tolerance for illegal migration to Polish territory, which is simultaneously the EU territory.”
He said for several years, Poland’s neighbours, Russia and Belarus “have been trying to help people smugglers breach our border, exploiting people, exploiting tragic situations and using them as a tool of hybrid warfare and putting them under unnecessary risk. And Poland had to respond. Polish border are now some of the best protected borders of the EU”.
He also said Poland and Pakistan shared a “common perspective on sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. This principle holds particular significance in our region in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“Recent Russian violations of the Polish airspace — and you know a thing or two about that around here — is an outrageous and unprecedented miliatry provocation. It is new stage of Russian attempts to destabilise the situation in our part of Europe,” he said.
The foreign minister added that “Poland remains steadfast in its support of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and welcomes all efforts towards achieving such a peace. It should be based on the UN Charter and international law”.
On Gaza, he said “we root for peace” there. “Poland has recognised Palestine for decades, and we believe there should a two-state solution for the two ancient peoples of the Middle East to live in dignity and peace with each other”.
Concluding his speech, FM Sikorski underlined that Poland was also interested in a “stable and prosperous South Asia”.
“We welcome all the efforts of Pakistan, both regional and globally, that help to achieve this aim.”
Polish FM lands in Islamabad
Earlier today, the Foreign Office said in a post social media platform X that “Deputy prime minister/foreign minister of Poland, His Excellency Radosław Sikorski, [had] arrived in Islamabad today for a two-day official visit”.
The FO added that Sikorski was received by the additional secretary for Europe, the Polish ambassador and other senior officials.
 






Later, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received Sikorski at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“The two leaders held a tête-à-tête meeting and exchanged views on matters of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






A day earlier, the FO had stated that the Polish minister would be paying an official visit to Islamabad at Dar’s invitation.
“This will be minister Sikorski’s second official visit to Pakistan; his previous visit took place in 2011,” the statement said. During the visit, Dar and Sikorski will hold a one-on-one meeting as well as delegation-level talks.
“The two sides are expected to discuss the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the FO said, adding that the talks would be followed by a joint press stakeout.
The FO said that Sikorski’s visit marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan-Poland relations” and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Warsaw “for the mutual benefit of both countries”.
 






In July, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to enhance collaboration via high-level visits, parliamentary interactions and dialogue, during the 9th round of Bilateral Political Consultations between the two countries held in Warsaw.
At these consultations, regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations would be held in Islamabad in 2026.</p><small>2025-10-23 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630088-ten-armed-forces-officers-inducted-into-civil-service' target='_blank'><strong>Ten armed forces officers inducted into civil service</strong></a><br><p>

X, Musk’s social media platform, had been in opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2023 decision to police the internet by allowing thousands of officials to file takedown orders.
In August, Reuters reported that police inspectors were issuing takedown orders on cartoons and satirical posts, sparking one of X’s most high-profile legal challenges against a government’s content-removal policy.
 
 

X lost the lawsuit in Karnataka High Court in September, with a judge ruling that its challenge was without merit and X had to abide by local laws. But late on Wednesday, India’s IT ministry changed its policy by limiting the number of people who can issue such orders to top bureaucrats and police officials.
Now only bureaucrats with the rank of joint secretary or higher and police officials who are serving as deputy inspector general or above can issue takedown orders, the government said in its modification to the rules.
“The government is backing down and reducing its earlier powers that extended to many more officials, but the number of officials who can issue orders will still be in the hundreds,” said Akash Karmakar, a partner at Indian law firm Panag & Babu who specialises in technology law.
The changes are meant to ensure “additional safeguards to ensure senior-level accountability, precise specification of unlawful content and periodic review of government directions at (a) higher level”, a government statement said.
X did not respond to a request for comment. It previously said it would challenge the Karnataka High Court’s ruling.
Government backing down, ‘reasoned intimation’ needed
In its court challenge, X argued that India’s actions were illegal and unconstitutional, adding that they trampled upon free speech by allowing scores of government agencies and thousands of police to suppress legitimate criticism of public officials.
India contended that it was attempting to curb a proliferation of illegal content and ensure accountability online.
When it changed its rules on Wednesday, the government did not make reference to its legal fight with the social media platform. In July, X’s counsel said in court that every “Tom, Dick, and Harry” in India was illegally issuing takedown orders.
The change in rules will become effective on November 15.
“The process of challenging these takedown orders remains onerous and inverts the burden of proof on the user whose content is taken down, curbing free speech,” said Karmakar, the tech-focused lawyer.
The new rules also require content takedown orders to be supported by a “reasoned intimation”, “clearly specifying the legal basis and statutory provision invoked, the nature of the unlawful act” as well as the website’s address.
The earlier rules did not contain such requirements.
In another layer of scrutiny, the rules also add a requirement that takedown orders shall be “subject to periodic review” by an officer of secretary rank once a month.</p><small>2025-10-23 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f2f45bb7700.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949538/media-the-ai-storm-drowning-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>MEDIA: THE AI STORM DROWNING PAKISTAN</strong></a><br><p>The climate crisis in Pakistan over the years has exacerbated to the extent that it has become the new norm, with floods impacting cities, livelihoods and homes of millions of people in the country. In 2025 alone, Pakistan experienced devastating floods, with an estimated 4.2 million people affected in Punjab, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
As the floodwaters rose, however, a parallel crisis emerged online. In response to the floods,  many Pakistanis turned to digital technologies for weather updates, relief efforts and communicating with communities affected by the floods.
 
 

At the same time, in response to this reliance on updates from digital platforms, there’s also been a rapid surge in climate change disinformation, intended to sensationalise an already tragic environment and garner more views for spreading confusion.
More alarmingly, the surge of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on platforms has largely gone unchecked. This has allowed manufactured information to be widely believed, promoting dangerous narratives online.

Millions of Pakistanis affected by floods are turning to social media for help. Instead, they’re finding AI-generated lies: fake geopolitical attacks, sexualised “rescue” videos and fabricated tragedies designed to maximise engagement

THE RISE OF MISINFORMATION
A recent study by the Lahore-based Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) of which I was a co-author, Combatting Flood Misinformation in Pakistan: Generative AI and Platform Accountability in the Age of Climate Crisis, investigated some of these trends and the kind of misinformation being fuelled on platforms, leading to further polarisation and dangerous narratives being promoted.
The report points out how AI is being weaponised in the climate crisis, with viral TikTok visuals portraying India’s release of dam water into overflowing rivers downstream into Pakistani Punjab as a deliberate act of hostility. This AI-generated footage on various social media platforms has been dramatising this narrative, depicting Indian workers maliciously releasing water as a calculated tactic of war.
This framing of a natural catastrophe within a singular geopolitical narrative, fuels existing India-Pakistan tensions. More critically, it serves to divert attention from domestic shortcomings in governance, flood management and relief efforts.
 
 

Such narratives are often pushed by bad-faith actors, seeking to profit from engagement or to advance divisive political agendas, exploiting the climate crisis for their own ends.
Today, when 40 per cent of Pakistan’s population remains illiterate and generative AI is becoming more advanced and sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify information online as being disinformation or authentic news, with many falling into the trap of climate disinformation online. The combination of low digital literacy, the inherent realism of AI-generated content and a high-stakes crisis creates a perfect storm for misinformation to thrive.
WOMEN AS CLICKBAIT
Beyond geopolitical narratives, AI-generated content has also enabled a more insidious form of exploitation: technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including the rise of AI-generated “woman-in-crisis” content. The trend has been seen across multiple platforms, where AI-generated depictions of women are used both to elicit sympathy and to exploit a natural disaster as a vehicle for sexualising women’s bodies.
TikTok and Instagram are rife with such videos, showing rural women navigating flooded landscapes, often carrying babies. These clips attract thousands of views, yet only a small fraction carry TikTok’s “AI content” label.
Following this theme, users have been seen posting hyper-sexualised depictions of women in flood settings, shifting the focus from the floods to women’s bodies. This sets a dangerous precedent in a context where women already face heightened risks of gender-based violence during disasters in relief camps.
Pakistani TikTok and Instagram accounts have also been producing “AI village fetish” content, including videos portraying unconscious women being touched inappropriately under the guise of “rescue”, and bad actors have exploited the floods as another opportunity for engagement.
The DRF report uncovered several AI-generated videos depicting women drenched in floodwaters with men groping them under the pretext of saving them.
This sexualisation also appears in village-vlog-style videos, where an AI-generated woman ostensibly documents the destruction of her flooded village. Yet the focus of these clips remains on her physical appearance and body rather than the devastation itself. While less explicit, these videos still perpetuate objectification to maximise engagement.
Alarmingly, comments on such content show that many older Pakistani users interpret these videos as genuine depictions of women affected by floods, which shows the urgent need for clear and prominent AI labelling.
Without such safeguards, misinformation not only distorts reality but also normalises the exploitation of women’s bodies during humanitarian crises.
EXPLOITING TRAGEDIES
Similarly, AI has also been used to exploit real tragedies, such as an Instagram reel recreating the tragedy that unfolded in Swat in June this year. At least 17 people were caught for hours in the middle of the river after the water suddenly surged, before being swept away and drowning.
The entirely AI-generated clip fabricates visuals and overlays screaming voices of the victims. This type of synthetic content is deeply insensitive and dangerous. It has the ability to distort the memory of a real disaster, trivialise the suffering of survivors and spread misinformation among audiences already grappling with fear and grief.
This fictionalisation of human tragedy for clicks and engagement not only undermines trust but also risks retraumatising affected communities.
PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY
At this time, while social media platforms are flooded with climate-related misinformation, TikTok remains the only platform to provide cautionary warnings and links to flood-related information for Pakistani users.
Although its flood safety guide marked a positive step, the initiative has been limited in scope. TikTok, like many other social media platforms, has failed to adequately address the scale of misinformation, particularly from generative AI content. These platforms do not cater to regional languages or reflect Pakistan’s diverse media landscape. As a result, outreach has always been restricted to a relatively small segment of users who can read and comprehend English and Urdu.
In moments of crisis, social media platforms carry a responsibility to uphold global standards. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) provide a clear benchmark to companies to respect users’ rights and mitigate harm, which includes curbing disaster-related misinformation, as part of their duty to protect human rights in digital spaces.
Misinformation during emergencies is not a trivial issue. It can compromise humanitarian aid and disaster response by changing perceptions, damaging credibility, and disrupting coordination.
As climate catastrophes become a recurring norm, striking Pakistan almost every year, platforms have a responsibility to support users during crises, rather than adding to these challenges in an already impending disaster.

Justice Hassan’s observation came as an eight-member CB heard over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
The PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The hearing
Advocate Uzair Bhandari, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), began his arguments today. The hearing was adjourned till November 10, with Justice Aminuddin Khan saying that a later date would be fixed for the hearing if the bench was not available that day.
 


Justice Aminuddin is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan and Hassan.
At the outset of the hearing, retired Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, a former judge of the Lahore High Court who resigned four years before his superannuation, came to the rostrum.
Justice Mandokhail asked Jamil whether he had a separate petition against the 26th Amendment, to which the latter replied that his client has requested for the “implementation of the Practice and Procedure Committee’s decision”.
The former judge informed the court that he had a visit abroad scheduled for November 2, with Justice Aminuddin telling him that the CB will listen to his arguments towards the end of the proceedings.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You may present your arguments after returning […] We will also be fresh.”
Subsequently, Advocate Bhandari came to the rostrum and said he will present his arguments on the “current value” of the 26th Amendment.
However, Justice Mandokhail directed him to inform the court which bench could hear the case before presenting his main arguments.
Bhandari noted the bench’s “concern” that Article 191A, through which the CB was introduced in the apex court, was in place. “The bench considers that Article 191A bars it from referring the matter to a full court.”
Here, Justice Hassan told the SIC lawyer to detail what constitutes a full court. Justice Mandokhail quipped that the CB wanted to know whether a full court would be “formed on wishes or as per the law”.
Bhandari responded that it will be according to the law. He added that “full courts are never formed; they always exist”, echoing the stances taken by lawyers Munir A. Malik and Dr Adnan Khan.
Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Bhandari whether a full court was a “precedent” and had not been defined in the Constitution, the counsel contended that a full court’s definition was stated in Article 176 (constitution of SC).
Noting that the question now was who would form the full court, Bhandari argued that the current CB could issue orders for it, which would be “binding on all persons”.
Justice Mazhar then again raised a question mulled repeatedly in recent hearings: “How can Article 191A, due to which this bench was constituted, be ignored?”
Bhandari replied, “Even when the authority is taken away from one court, it still has the authority to send [the case] to the competent court.”
Justice Mazhar reiterated that the foundations of the CB were provided under Article 191A, adding that the lawyer was arguing to “ignore” that provision.
Justice Hassan also remarked, “You are making us ignore Article 191A, but also want this bench to pass an order.”
At this, Bhandari stressed, “I have not requested to suspend the 26th Constitutional Amendment in my petition. If the Amendment is suspended, then you all would not be even able to hear any case.”
Justice Mazhar once again observed that he and other judges were part of the current CB under Article 191A, asking rhetorically how the provision could be disregarded.
Addressing Bhandari, Justice Hassan noted, “If Article 191A is ignored, then that would amount to granting you final relief.”
The SIC council contended that the court had to decide “whether Article 191A is valid or not”.
Justice Mazhar responded that the provision — introduced under the same Amendment that is under challenge — is “valid, which is why it is a part of the Constitution”.
 
 

Justice Afghan then observed, “The question is what forum can declare Article 191A right or wrong.”
Bhandari answered the judge, saying that the SC had the jurisdiction to hear the case. “This would amount to suspending the 26th Amendment,” Justice Aminuddin remarked.
Bhandari said he would first “remove the obstacle of Article 191A in front of him”. “Only the lordships in the bench are consistently raising this question. The ladyships have not asked any question,” he said.
“The ladies have understood the matter,” Justice Hilali quipped. Justice Mandokhail added, “The women judges are sharper than me.”
At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A was not taking away someone else’s powers, but was vesting them in the SC.
“No jurisdiction has been taken away anywhere,” she asserted.
Bhandari then recalled that once a former United States judge was asked why a full court hears all cases, to which the judge responded that the jurisdiction lay with the US top court, not with the benches.
Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “The Supreme Court has given the powers to the benches.” In response, the lawyer contended that every judge belonged to the SC and had “judicial powers”.
The hearing was then adjourned till November 10, with Bhandari set to continue his arguments.
Requests for full court
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s (BHCBA) counsel Munir A. Malik, Afrasiab Khattak’s counsel Khwaja Ahmed Hosain, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Other lawyers have also presented arguments for a 24-member full court based on judges present in the SC currently, including six who were appointed after the Amendment.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-23 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231329544f734d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950771/centres-decision-on-fate-of-extremist-party-expected-to-come-shortly-says-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Centre’s decision on ‘fate of extremist party’ expected to come shortly, says Punjab minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari said on Thursday that a decision on the “fate of an extremist party” — an apparent reference to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan — was expected to come shortly from the federal government.
“The Punjab government had prepared its case on this and forwarded it,” she added.
She made this statement during a press conference in Lahore, days after the Punjab government forwarded a summary to the Centre to ban the religio-political party and amid reports of a federal cabinet meeting scheduled for later today.
At the press conference, the provincial minister detailed recent measures taken by the Punjab government pertaining to law and order and security following a TLP protest earlier this month.
These also include steps taken regarding weapons possession and licences, on which Bokhari said the provincial government had “suspended the licences of 28 weapons’ dealers and the shops of some other fake dealers who lacked licences have been sealed”.
“There is a zero-tolerance policy on buying and selling of weapons, and as I said earlier, no licence for weapons will now be issued in Punjab,” she added.
The minister further stated that currently, over one million people in the province had weapons’ licences. “A province where such a large number [of people] have licences for weapons, you can figure out how big a challenge it is to maintain peace.”
Moreover, 47,918 security companies in the province had weapons’ licences and the number of licences issued to various institution exceeded 42,000, she added.
Bokhari then went on to share some details of weapons and ammunition, which she said had been found in custody of “people belonging to the TLP”.
With pictures displayed on a screen in the background, she said TLP protesters had snatched weapons, ammunition and other articles from police during their protests in previous years.
“This is their modus operandi. They surround police, snatch vehicles, weapons and tear gas guns from them and use them later.
“In the 2021[protest], they robbed 3,498 tear gas shells, 23 tear gas guns, 326 anti-riot kits, two 12-bore pistols and 11 submachine guns,” she said. Pointing to one of the pictures on the screen, she added that they matched the bullets that were shot at police during the TLP’s recent protest.
According to Bokhari, TLP activist damaged eight police vehicles and snatched a submachine gun, two 12-bore pistols, 945 bullets during their recent protest. Moreover, the minister said the protesters had snatched 197 helmets, 22 kits, 130 “safety sheets”, one tear gas guns and 984 tear gas shells, of all which wear part of anti-riot gear.
They even damaged Safe City cameras, Bokhari added.
She further said that a special prosecution cell was working on cases pertaining to the TLP, in which 559 suspects had been sent on physical remand. Among them, 161 were sent to jail and 190 were on judicial remand, she added.
Moving on actions taken regarding social media posts, she said a total of “75 links” had been blocked for sharing hateful and inciting material and 107 people had been apprehended.
Bokhari further said citizens could give tip-offs to police about “the extremist party” and “illegal citizens, be it Afghans or anyone else”, by calling 15 police helpline. Their calls would be transferred to a special cell and the informants’ name would be kept secret, she assured.
She stressed that “dala culture”, too, would not be tolerated.
“Giving a call for strike and forcing shops, business and transport to shut down is totally unacceptable. Cases will be registered under terrorism laws [against those involved],” she further warned.
Bokhari also emphasised that there was a province-wide ban on posters, pamphlets, branding or any other kind of publicity of “extremist mobs”.
About Afghan refugees, she said combing operations had been initiated to identify those lacking the necessary documents, who would then be shifted to centres established at the district level. They would then be sent back to their country in a respectful manner.
This would also apply to others residing in Punjab “illegally”, she said, adding that “information was being collected about illegal citizens doing business in Punjab so that they could also be repatriated”.
In this connection, the minister warned that renting or leasing out properties to “illegal citizens” or letting them stay at one’s residence was a crime and action would taken over it. “The Punjab government has taken a decision on this and it is being implemented.”
She also said the Punjab government had requested the Centre to regularise weapons’ factories.
TLP protest
The Punjab government’s decision to seek a ban on the TLP was made during a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Oct 16, five days after the religio-political party had begun a protest march in Lahore.
The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in mutiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi.
The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of Oct 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on Oct 13 that resulted in their dispersal.
Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road.
Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging.
On Oct 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation.
Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The Punjab government has been taking stringent measures since, while several TLP activists have been arrested with cases against them registered under terrorism laws.
However, there has been no official confirmation about the whereabouts of TLP chief Saad Rizvi. But, according to an Oct 20 report from Dawn, authorities in Punjab have claimed to have traced his and his brother Anas’s whereabouts, saying that they had fled to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
In the meeting chaired by Maryam on Oct 16, it was also decided to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act. \
The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 ATA.
Several others decisions were also made during the session, following which Bokhari shared during an Oct 21 press conference that individuals providing “financial or political support” to TLP would face terrorism charges.
“Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” she had said.
She had further claimed that 1.92 kilogrammes of gold was recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grammes of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged.
She further stated that the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged.”
Bokhari had also said 95 bank accounts linked to Saad Rizvi had been frozen.
She had also shared that the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to ban the party to the Centre.
Previously, the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.</p><small>2025-10-23 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2313482539bb5f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950774/from-hospital-bed-to-cricket-legend-how-sadiq-mohammads-heroics-saved-pakistan-a-test-match' target='_blank'><strong>From hospital bed to cricket legend: How Sadiq Mohammad’s heroics saved Pakistan a Test match</strong></a><br><p>A maiden career century at Melbourne in 1972-73 got Sadiq Mohammad, Pakistan’s dashing left-handed opening batsman, noticed in Tasmania, where Latrobe Cricket Club brought him over to both coach and play for them. He was the youngest of five brothers — Wazir, Raees, Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq — four of whom played Test cricket for Pakistan.
Playing cricket in Tasmania offered Sadiq a fat pay-check, and while the standard of cricket was still wanting (they were not yet part of the Sheffield Shield, Australia’s first-class circuit), this was a real chance for him to cement his status as a professional cricketer, at a time when playing for Pakistan still meant poor pay.
 


In 1974-75, the West Indies were coming to tour Pakistan, in one of Clive Lloyd’s first captaincy assignments, and recent debuts for two West Indies cricketers — Andy Roberts and Viv Richards. They were also on the back of a competitive 5-match series in India, which they had won 3-2.
A bureaucratic struggle
Sadiq and Majid Khan had already established themselves as Pakistan’s premier opening partnership, and the Board of Cricket Control in Pakistan (BCCP, the precursor to the PCB) asked the former to come over for the two match Test series.
However, Sadiq was told in Tasmania that he would not get paid for the matches he would miss while on national duty. Sadiq told Abdul Hafeez Kardar, president of the Board at the time, that for him to come back, the BCCP would have to pay both his Pakistan match fee, and the fees he would be missing from Tasmania.
Latrobe would not have let Sadiq go so easily. Having won their maiden trophy in the 1973-74 season (also their first final) mainly due to their marquee player, the Pakistan call-up came right during the Australian cricket season. In that season, Sadiq had scored 542 runs at an average of 42, and claimed 67 wickets. In just the final game, he scored 162 and took 43-5 in the first innings, and 20-4 in the second.
As recorded in Summer’s Warriors, a compilation of cricket in North-Western Tasmania, for the 1974-75 season, “Latrobe’s chances took a big blow when Sadiq was called up by Pakistan selectors to meet the West Indians”.
 


“Kardar ney zyada lift nahin karayi (he was not keen on it) and asked me to forgo the match fee and come back to play for our country,“ Sadiq told Dawn.com in a recent interview. “I reiterated that now I am a professional, and if the board was willing to pay for me to come back, only then I would,” he added.
Pakistan then went ahead with Agha Zahid, who ended up failing in the Lahore Test, his first and final match.
“The Board was now ready to pay all fees as well as a return-ticket.”
However, to the media, the Board gave a different story. In a Reuters wire titled, “Changed Plans”, published in The Canberra Times, it was reported that “Pakistani opener Sadiq Mohammad has changed his mind and returned from Australia to play for Pakistan in the Second Test against the West Indies, cricket officials said in Rawalpindi today.”
Sadiq then flew overnight from Hobart to Sydney, then from Singapore to Karachi, and reached a day before the Test fixture began on March 1.
Tragedy strikes
In the first innings, Sadiq was out for 27, yet Pakistan declared at 406-8, with Wasim Raja getting his maiden Test century. A pitch invasion followed, causing the match to be suspended for almost two and a half hours.
The West Indies, in response, made 493, and this is where Sadiq’s call-up from Australia was about to be worth every single penny. However, tragedy nearly struck.
 


“I was fielding at short-leg and told Intikhab Alam (captain) to move me. It was apparent that the West Indies were going to declare in a few overs,” Sadiq recalled to Dawn.com.
Intikhab, however, stuck with his field.
“He then bowled a full toss, and Vanburn Holder pulled it right at the top of my neck, behind my left ear,” said Sadiq.
Things become slightly murky as to where Sadiq was standing and who hit him. Sadiq recalls that Holder struck him, which is reiterated in his brother Mushtaq Mohammad’s autobiography, Inside Out. The Guardian and ESPNcricinfo write that Bernard Julien, on the way to his second Test century, struck Sadiq.
Yet the scene was horrific. Mushtaq writes: “He was lying still but would have little nervous fits and I really thought he was going to go … The television cameras focused on me with my hands on my head looking horrified; I thought he was going to die.”
His brother, Hanif Mohammad, in his autobiography, Playing for Pakistan, writes: “I was giving expert comments on the match but my heart was no longer in the task, as I was really worried about him.”
Sadiq was rushed off the field and taken to Jinnah Hospital, around 20 minutes away, where Dr Omer Jooma, a renowned neurosurgeon, was in the operation theatre but came out to examine Sadiq.
“On looking where the ball had struck, he said that had it been just slightly higher, I would have had my fateha read,” recalls Sadiq.
Dr Jooma gave him an injection, and some painkillers for the next day. Sadiq was taken back to the ground, but then saw that Pakistan had slipped to 90-4. The West Indies had a lead of 87 runs, so effectively, the hosts were batting at 3 with 4 down.
The heroics
The next morning, Wasim Bari was run out on the first ball of the day.
“So, in I walked at 90-5, taking Brufen to help with the pain. I had already made up my mind the previous evening that I would go out to bat, especially since no bone was broken. My mother also told me to go out and save the Test for Pakistan.”
“That morning I was reading namaz and prayed that ‘Allah miyan please do a miracle that we save this Test’”.
After Asif Iqbal was out on 77, the tail was exposed.
Sadiq then batted the first 6 deliveries of each over — for the 1974-75 season, Tests in Pakistan had eight-ball overs — and then looked for a single to give the tail-ender the strike for one or two balls. Sarfaraz Nawaz, Asif Masood, and Liaquat Ali, all three fast bowlers who barely batted, were now facing a relentless attack from Roberts and Holder.
 


Sadiq kept spitting out blood while batting, “At times, I felt loose-headed and would then take a minute or so to get myself in order.”
In the modern game, Sadiq would definitely not have been allowed to continue, but at the time this Test took place, helmets were not part of the game. Their first inclusion in Tests was still three years away.
Meanwhile, Sadiq was not the only Pakistani fielding casualty. Wasim Raja had injured his ankle tendons while bowling and was off the field. When Liaquat Ali got out and Wasim was the only batter left. Sadiq was batting on 96.
Wasim then walked in wearing a plaster on his ankles. Sadiq had by now batted for over 5 hours.
A Test century however, was not in the script. Confusion denied Sadiq his ton.
“Zaheer Abbas came on as a runner for Wasim. I thought there were two balls left in the over, and hit the ball towards midwicket. Zaheer came running back for the third but I sent him back when he was two-thirds of the way down,” reminisced Sadiq.
“To my surprise, the over was called, and I was on the striker’s end. I then crossed over and Wasim was bowled by [Lance] Gibbs in the next over. I was left stranded on 98.”
The Test however, was saved. There was less than an hour for the day to end, and when the West Indies came out, they had 25 minutes left to chase 170 runs. Zaheer Abbas bowled one over in which he conceded a no-ball, the solitary run of the innings.
“I took a flight back to Australia that night, as part of my promise to return to Tasmania as soon as possible.”
 


News of Sadiq’s feat spread, with The Times of India writing: “Gallant Sadiq Saves Pakistan” and The Guardian proclaiming: “Sadiq Beats Pain to Force Draw”.
Back in Australia, Sadiq narrowly missed out on claiming a second title for Latrobe despite an all-round performance in the final against Wynyard, where he scored 29 and took crucial wickets.
The youngest Mohammed brother had been defiant on two counts. Not only had he denied the West Indies a sure win, but his negotiations with the board and Kardar in particular, would be the precursor to the pay disputes between Pakistani cricketers and the board for years to come.</p><small>2025-10-23 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630068-pakistan-slams-israels-bid-to-annex-occupied-west-bank-urges-global-action' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan slams Israel's bid to annex occupied West Bank, urges global action</strong></a><br><p>

After making stopovers in Sukkur, Multan, Lahore, Nurpur Noon and Islamabad, the rally will eventually culminate in Peshawar on Oct 29. This year, too, the classic cars participating in the rally include some dating back to 1960. The oldest car this time is a 1960 Chevrolet Impala along with a 1963 Chevrolet Impala, a 1972 Toyota Corona, a 1977 Mercedes 240D, a 1980 Mercedes 500SL and a 1986 Mercedes 300SEL, to name a few.

“This first-ever classic car rally of Pakistan started from Karachi on Nov 5, 2010 and has since been regularly held every year. The VCRDAP is a cluster of all the classic car rally drivers of Pakistan, who have taken part in different classic car rallies held in Pakistan since 2010. The aim of holding this unique national motoring event is a big step forward in projecting a soft image of Pakistan to the outer world, year after year,” said VCRDAP’s founder and President Imad Samad.
Lucky to be on an autumn break from her school, his and Fozia’s 14-year-old daughter, Maryam Samad, is also coming along. The youngest participant of this rally in 2011 at the age of only six months, Maryam this year will take turns riding with her father sometimes and with her mother at other times.

Cars from as far back as 1960 take part in rally that ends in Peshawar on Oct 29

A unique feature of this year’s rally is a women’s team of Fozia Imad and Sabina Mansoor. Fozia, a rally participant as a driver for a third time (she has otherwise been accompanying her husband for 14 to 15 years), is driving a black 1977 Mercedes 240D and Sabina is driving a red 1952 MG TD. Sabina’s husband Capt Mansoor ul Islam, meanwhile, compliments her by driving a green 1952 MG TD. Fozia’s husband Imad is in a red 1960 Chevrolet Impala, which belongs to his friend Rais Matloob Ahmed. “It is the oldest sedan in this year’s rally,” said Imad.

All the cars in the rally are well-maintained and in great shape. “We have kept them in proper running condition so that they can undertake this long cross country journey,” said VCRDAP’s Vice President Shoaib Qureshy, who also founded the Antique Cars Museum. “This rally is a statement of the passion and the spirit of veteran rally drivers,” he added. Shoaib is himself driving a 1980 Mercedes 500 SL.
He also briefed that the rally will feature a Grand Classic Car Show at the Pink Polo Festival in the Lahore Polo Club Grounds on Oct 26, which will be hosted by the Patron of VCRDAP Adnan Hayat Noon, an avid classic car enthusiast, rally driver and collector. “Another 30 cars will join this rally from Lahore onwards. Among them are a 1976 Cadillac Eldorado, a 1968 MGB GT, a 1959 Austin Healey 3,000, a 1961 Jaguar Mark 10, a 1972 Mercedes 300SEL, a 1965 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, a Rolls Royce Silver Spur, a 1977 VW Campervan, a 1965 Ford Mustang, 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia and several others,” informed Shoaib.
“After Lahore, en-route to Islamabad, the rally will make a stopover at the beautiful and historic estates of Nurpur Noon, where Adnan Hayat Noon and his family are hosting the rally participants. In Islamabad, they will be hosted by the CEO of Murree Brewery Isphanyar Bhandara, who is himself a well-known Mercedes Benz collector,” VCRDAP’s vice president added.

“The rally will conclude in Peshawar, where the VCRDAP Peshawar members have organised an elaborate closing ceremony to mark the completion of this iconic cross-country journey,” VCRDAP’s General Secretary Ahmed Agha concluded.
The drivers and their families have all taken care to pack warm clothes with them as they know that after Sindh they would be facing cold weather.

Israeli lawmakers voted on Wednesday to advance two bills on annexing the occupied West Bank, barely a week after US President Donald Trump pushed through a deal aimed at ending Israel’s two-year military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement released today, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s attempt to extend its so-called ‘sovereignty’ over parts of the occupied West Bank, including illegal Israeli settlements, through a draft law introduced in the legislature of the occupying power.”
 






The FO said that these actions constituted a “flagrant violation” of international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
“Such provocative and unlawful measures undermine ongoing efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.
It called on the international community to take “urgent and decisive action” to halt these illegal steps and to hold the Israeli occupying forces accountable for their continued violations of international law.
“Pakistan reiterates its commitment to working with regional and international partners to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, and to ensure peace, justice, and dignity for the Palestinians,” the FO said.
The FO also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
The vote in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday was the first of four needed to pass the law and it coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party did not support the legislation, which was put forth by lawmakers outside his ruling coalition and passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers. A second bill by an opposition party proposing the annexation of the Maale Adumim settlement passed by 31-9.
Members of Netanyahu’s coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the occupied West Bank, territory to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Israel argues the territories it captured in 1967 are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied.
The UN’s highest court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
The Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in some areas of the occupied West Bank.
US says Israel annexation moves in West Bank ‘threatening’ peace deal
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza peace deal.
“I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said of annexation as he boarded his plane for a visit to Israel.
Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal,” he told reporters.
 






“They’re a democracy, they’re going to have their votes, and people are going to take these positions,” he said.
“But at this time, it’s something that we … think might be counterproductive,” he said.
Asked about increased violence by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Rubio said: “We’re concerned about anything that threatens to destabilise what we’ve worked on.”
But Rubio voiced optimism overall for preserving the peace deal.
“Every day there’ll be threats to it, but I actually think we’re ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,” Rubio said.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23105005cae0647.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950762/dar-says-regional-connectivity-not-optional-essential-for-growth-and-shared-progress' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says regional connectivity not optional, essential for growth and shared progress</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Thursday that regional connectivity was not optional, terming it essential for growth and shared progress.
“Connectivity is not optional. It is essential for stability, growth and shared progress. Regional cooperation directly impacts the lives of millions of our people,” he said while addressing the Regional Transport Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad.
Transport Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, among others, are participating in the two-day conference. Delegates from the Asian Development Bank, Economic Cooperation Organisation, International Road Transport Union, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific are also attending.
In his remarks, Dar said that many countries in the region were already investing in forward-looking connectivity projects. “Central Asia is emerging as a true trans Eurasian land bridge,” he said.
He noted that oil and gas pipelines laid down across deserts and mountains linked markets, while expanding road and rail networks demonstrated a collective commitment.
“These projects are not just infrastructure, they create shared opportunities. We can and must achieve more by aligning our efforts and working together. The whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.”
He further said that Pakistan’s strategic location connecting South Asia with Central Asia, the Middle East and China made it a “natural hub for regional connectivity”.
“Our vision is to build seamless linkages through road, rail, air, maritime, energy and digital corridors — turning geography into an opportunity,” he said.
“No project better symbolises Pakistan’s vision of win-win cooperation through connectivity than the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),” he said, adding that the project was now widely recognised as a “catalyst for energy infrastructure development, transport connectivity and enhanced trade across the whole of South and Central Asia”.
“It embodies our commitment to building partnerships that deliver tangible benefits, not just for Pakistan and China but for the entire region.”
Dar also called Pakistan’s high-speed motorways and national highways the “backbone of regional and domestic connectivity”, linking key border crossings to the Karachi and Gwadar ports.
“Integrated border and maritime systems enable faster transit, reduce costs and strengthen Pakistan’s role as a vital trade and transit corridor,” he said.
Speaking on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Framework Agreement, he said it was a landmark initiative that had opened new trade avenues. Similarly, he said the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad road and rail corridors offered a cost-effective land bridge across Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Asia.
“These corridors hold immense promise for regional trade and beyond,” he said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s partnership in the Central Asia–South Asia (CASA-1000) electricity transmission and trade project transmitting surplus electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He also stressed the country’s commitment to investing in energy projects such as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP-500) electricity transmission project for strengthening energy security, supporting economic growth and “linking our markets and resources for our shared progress”.
He added that Pakistan was also expanding and modernising its ports and logistics infrastructure and enhancing air connectivity to promote tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges.
“Physical and digital connectivity must advance together,” the foreign minister stressed.
“Pakistan is prioritising digital trade platforms and e-port integration to create seamless, paperless and efficient trade flows, boosting efficiency, transparency and competitiveness, and ensuring that our connectivity vision is future-ready.”
He acknowledged the “valuable support” of Pakistan’s development partners, multilateral banks, UN agencies and regional organisations for their “technical expertise, financing and competitive building efforts” that were “instrumental” in moving the projects forward.
He called these initiatives “building blocks for regional integration, instruments for economic transformation and enablers of peace and stability”.
“They represent a future where goods, energy, data and people move without any hindrances across borders,” he said. “Where our economies complement [each other] and where connectivity drives inclusive growth.”
Dar said that the roundtable today would provide an opportunity to identify shared priorities and agree on practical steps for collaboration.
“Pakistan stands ready to coordinate transport plans, enhance cross-border facilitation, mobilise joint investments and strengthen regional value chains,” he said. “Every country has a vital role in the shared journey towards connectivity and prosperity.”
He invited all partners to deepen engagement, align strategies and forge durable partnerships, saying, “Together we can transform these corridors into engines of growth.
“Connectivity is about building trust, opportunity and shared destiny,” he added.
Dar ended by extending a “very warm welcome” to all the participants of the conference and wishing them productive and meaningful discussions with a “successful and fruitful outcome”.
“I thank you for your presence, your partnership and your commitment to advancing our shared vision of connectivity and cooperation,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630067-decision-to-ban-tlp-expected-soon-says-bokhari-ahead-of-federal-cabinet-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Bokhari hints at imminent decision on TLP ban ahead of federal cabinet meeting</strong></a><br><p>

According to sources, the PCB has also sent a formal notice for termination of the franchise’s contract “after completing all necessary legal procedures”. The move marks a significant escalation in the simmering tensions between the board and the Multan franchise.
Sources revealed that the action followed repeated public statements by franchise owner Ali Tareen, who allegedly criticised the PCB and PSL management.
In April, Ali shared a podcast clip on X questioning the PCB’s pre-season build-up, writing:
“How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Same games, same teams – what’s new? Fed up with hollow words. PCB had time to plan innovations, but we’re repeating last year. Our biggest brand deserves more. Explain the vision!”
A few days later, he sought to clarify his stance amid backlash from other franchise owners, posting:
“I love PSL – it’s a MADE-IN-PAKISTAN success story we all benefit from. My words were about pushing for real growth, not negativity. Salman Naseer & PCB team are giving their all. Let’s unite as owners to back them and elevate the league. No more stagnation!”
However, tensions persisted. In July, Ali renewed his criticism in response to a PCB post-season debrief video celebrating PSL 10’s “success”. He wrote: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting, digital engagement slowing – yet we’re celebrating? PCB, wake up. PSL deserves better planning, not self-congratulation. Time to fix these issues before it’s too late.”
A PCB source said the repeated statements “damaged the league’s reputation and violated the terms of the agreement”.
The board’s notice reportedly outlines specific clauses of the franchise agreement that were breached. PCB officials maintained that the board remains committed to upholding the integrity and professional standards of the PSL.
Al Multan Sultans spokesperson told Dawn on Thursday that “the PCB has sent a legal notice which is not a notice of termination”.
The development comes amid growing concerns over franchise-board relations within the PSL framework, with several stakeholders calling for greater transparency and consistency in the PCB’s dealings with team owners.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23105535354318c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950761/trump-slaps-tremendous-sanctions-on-russian-oil-for-ukraine-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump slaps ‘tremendous’ sanctions on Russian oil for Ukraine war</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies on Wednesday, complaining that his talks with Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine war “don’t go anywhere”.
The European Union also unveiled a fresh wave of sanctions to pressure Russia to end its relentless, three-and-a-half-year invasion of its neighbor, which is allied with both Washington and Brussels.
Trump has held off pulling the trigger on sanctions against Russia for months, but his patience snapped after plans for a fresh summit with Putin in Budapest collapsed.
“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said in response to a question from an AFP journalist in the Oval Office.
But Trump added that he hoped the “tremendous sanctions” against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil would be short-lived. “We hope that the war will be settled,” he said alongside Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday evening that the US still wants to meet with the Russians, despite the sanctions.
“We’re always going to be interested in engaging if there’s an opportunity to achieve peace,” Rubio told reporters.
Separately, the EU agreed to impose new measures aimed at crimping Moscow’s oil and gas revenues over the war, a spokesperson for the bloc’s current Danish presidency said.
That package — the 19th from the EU since the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion — sought to keep the pressure on Russia in light of Trump’s faltering peace push and an escalation of Russia’s offensive.
 
 

Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States welcomed the sanctions.
“This decision fully aligns with Ukraine’s consistent position that peace can only be achieved through strength and by exerting maximum pressure on the aggressor using all available international instruments,” Ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said in a statement.
The sanctions came hours after Russia’s latest overnight barrage on Ukraine killed seven people — including two children — and ripped into a kindergarten.
Not ‘honest and forthright’
The US sanctions represent a major stepping up of its actions against Russia and reflect Trump’s growing frustration at being unable to persuade Putin to end the conflict despite what he calls his personal chemistry with the Kremlin chief.
The sanctions involve a freezing of all Rosneft and Lukoil assets in the United States, while barring all US companies from doing any business with the two Russian oil titans.
“Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.
Bessent later told the Fox Business programme Kudlow that it was “one of the largest sanctions that we have done against the Russian Federation.
“President Putin has not come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we’d hoped,” Bessent said, adding that Trump was “disappointed at where we are in these talks”.
Trump this week halted plans to hold talks with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want a “wasted” meeting.
The Kremlin on Wednesday appeared to leave the door open for a summit, saying ahead of the sanctions announcement that preparations were still ongoing.
“No one wants to waste time, neither President Trump nor President Putin,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
EU oil and gas sanctions
As part of the new EU measures, the 27-nation bloc brought forward a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas from Russia by a year to the start of 2027.
It also blacklisted over 100 more tankers from Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ageing oil vessels and imposed controls on the travel of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.
The package is scheduled to be formally adopted on Thursday, just before Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky joins EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.
Zelensky signed a letter of intent with Sweden earlier on Wednesday to acquire 150 Gripen fighter jets.
During the latest Russian strikes, AFP journalists in Kyiv heard the buzzing of Russian drones and explosions throughout the night, and saw a pillar of smoke rising above the capital.
“My hands are still shaking,” Kyiv resident Mariana Gorchenko told AFP. “I jumped up, glad that my little one wasn’t in the room where the windows were blown out.”
The strikes also damaged a kindergarten in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv.</p><small>2025-10-23 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231008587ed73ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950759/age-love-and-perseverance-asif-afridis-story' target='_blank'><strong>Age, love and perseverance: Asif Afridi’s story</strong></a><br><p>People say “age is just a number” when they want to feel young again. But in truth, age tells a story — of perseverance, growth, and dreams pursued against time itself.
In Asif Afridi’s case, age represents the power to dream and the perseverance to achieve. It reflects the richness of skill and the mental fortitude of a 38-year-old Test debutant. Above all, it represents love — and how it drives him.
Love has driven Asif all his life. His love for cricket took him from team to team, city to city, in pursuit of a permanent place in either. It kept him going through the toil and hardship of Pakistan’s domestic circuit for no less than 16 years.
Now, as he finally made his Test debut for Pakistan in the second match against South Africa, love again inspired him.
Asif is father to four boys and a little girl — and unapologetically, he loves the girl the most. She is battling cerebral palsy in a hospital while Asif plays the Test, having already taken six wickets on debut.
But he wants to win it for his girl.
“I am worried for her but at the same time happy about my performance here,” he said on Wednesday.
“My wife is extending support and giving me hope during this time. I’m praying we win this match so that I can dedicate it to my daughter. I love her more than my boys.”
Just as Asif can bowl on a nagging line and length for hours — a skill he showcased in Rawalpindi — his love for his daughter is equally steadfast, something well known among his colleagues in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata cricket fraternity.
“What’s most special about him? It’s how he loves and takes care of his daughter,” Abdul Rehman, a renowned coach from Peshawar, told Dawn.com.
Describing Asif further, Rehman called him a “calm and cool” person — a temperament that has shaped his game.
“He’s humble, hardworking, and a master of his craft,” Rehman said. “His understanding of the game, the conditions, and the batter he’s bowling to has always been immaculate.”
That understanding was on full display during South Africa’s first innings in Rawalpindi, as Asif kept landing the ball right on target. He hardly missed the stumps and began reaping rewards late on the second day — trapping Tony de Zorzi lbw before producing a peach of a delivery to dismiss Dewald Brevis.
On the third day, he added four more wickets, even as South Africa fought back through Senuran Muthusamy and Kagiso Rabada, inching closer to a series-levelling win.
“All I wished coming into the Test match was to live up to my reputation in domestic cricket — someone who bowls a nagging line and length, whether I take wickets or not,” Asif told reporters.

“I wanted people to recognise me as a quality bowler. Thank God I did more than I wished for.”

Asif’s journey to this point hasn’t been straightforward. His domestic career suffered a major setback in 2023 when he was banned for a year for an anti-corruption offence — later determined to be an honest mistake. Yet he didn’t let it derail his focus, taking 27 wickets in the 2024 season.
Earlier this year, he led Fata to promotion to the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy — Pakistan’s premier first-class competition — claiming 33 wickets in just five matches in the Hanif Mohammad Trophy, a Grade II event.
For Asif, those performances came from a simple desire — to bow out of the game with his head held high.
“…if we hadn’t returned to first-class cricket that year, it would have been very difficult later,” he said.
“So I worked hard and bowled long spells. I always hoped, God willing, that whenever I play, wherever I play, I’ll perform in such a way that people say my career ended on a strong note.”
Little did Asif know that before hanging up his boots, he would wear the Pakistan Test cap. And when that moment finally arrived, it brought sheer happiness.
“When the captain informed me on the eve of the match that I’d be making my debut, believe me, I couldn’t sleep all night,” he said. “I was very happy — and so was my family.”
When Pakistan’s mainstays, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, walk to the crease this morning with a slender lead of 23, they will also be playing for Asif and his daughter.
And if Pakistan go on to win, it won’t just be a victory for the team — it will be a triumph of love, patience, and a father’s promise to his little girl.</p><small>2025-10-23 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2309262907cc920.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950628/6-killed-as-vehicle-ambushed-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed as vehicle ambushed in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>NORTH WAZIRISTAN: Six people were killed when unknown gunmen ambushed a vehicle in Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan tribal district here on Wednesday.
The incident took place near Api village where a car, carrying six inmates, was attacked by unknown assailants. As a result, all the inmates died on the spot. Sources said that after the tragic incident, the attackers poured petrol on the vehicle and set it on fire, which badly burnt the bodies.
District police officer Waqar Ahmed confirmed the incident, saying that the suspects managed to escape after the attack, while the bodies were shifted to Mirali Hospital for identification.
Identity of the deceased has not been ascertained as yet, he said.
Sources said motive behind the attack could not be known. However, they added that the deceased were reportedly members of a local peace committee. 
The police and security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the attackers.

Since the last week of September, police have registered five such cases but are reportedly reluctant to register another one that occurred recently, sources told Dawn.
A victim of such an incident visited the Khanna police station twice to register her case, but the police gave her a cold shoulder and made ‘lame excuses’.
Talking to Dawn, Mohammad Umer Saeed, son of the alleged victim, said his mother along with his sister, was waiting for a passenger vehicle on the Islamabad Expressway on Sunday when a car carrying three women stopped and called for passengers going to Gujar Khan. His mother and sister boarded the vehicle.
After some time, the passengers inside the vehicle snatched a purse from the victim.
When she raised an alarm, the suspects pushed her and her daughter out of the moving vehicle near Khanna and escaped. The purse contained a mobile phone and Rs2,000 in cash, he said.
Following the incident, the victim and her daughter went to the Khanna Police Station, but the “police ignored them, pretending to be busy”.
They waited for the duty officer to listen to their complaint, but no one paid attention, the citizen said. After some time, the duty officer left the police station without hearing her case, forcing her to return to her hometown, Gujar Khan.
The next day (Monday), she returned to the police station with her son and submitted a written complaint to the duty officer. The officer took her to the station clerk (moharrar), who told her that the duty officer on duty the previous day was on leave and that the matter was his responsibility. The clerk accepted her complaint but did not provide any receipt, complaint number, or e-tag and asked her to return later.
Since then, no one from the police station has contacted the family to inquire about the incident or inform them about any legal action.
Sources in the police said that since September 26, the capital police have registered five such cases. One case each was registered at the Secretariat and Tarnol police stations, where culprits looted Rs140,000 and Rs100,000 respectively.
In October, similar cases were reported at the Industrial Area, Secretariat and Khanna police stations, in which culprits looted Rs40,000, Rs80,000 and Rs300,000 respectively. The sources said that the gangs involved in these crimes operate with two distinct modus operandi. One group uses private cars to offer rides to people, while the other pretends to operate passenger vehicles.
The latter group also includes female accomplices who participate in the crimes and help lure victims. The gangs usually target people waiting at bus stops and pick them up under the pretext of taking them to their destinations before snatching their cash and valuables.

PM Shehbaz visited Egypt last week to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. Among his many engagements with world leaders, the premier had also met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
 






Fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan noted that posts from multiple users on social media platform X, particularly PTI supporters, since October 13, had shared a low quality and blurry image of the meeting with the Armenian premier , claiming it showed PM Shehbaz and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the Middle East Summit in Egypt. This was despite Netanyahu not even attending the event.
Gulzar had also shared the image with the same claim in a now-deleted post with the following caption: “Article 6! Treason! Pakistan does not recognise Israel let alone a genocidal murderer like Netanyahu.”
 


“I have deleted my tweet on Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Netanyahu as the picture is not 100 per cent clear,” said Gulzar in a followup post.
The PTI MNA had further alleged: “What is 200pc clear and proof is available with ‘concerned’ people, a meeting was arranged between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu. I will be demanding logs from Foreign Office of these secret meetings between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu in summer 2025 to discuss Abraham Accords. Good luck on obtaining those. Meeting was arranged beforehand by friends of Israel. Full delegation from both sides present.”
 






Gulzar had subsequently reposted a copy of a first information report (FIR) lodged against her on Sunday at the NCCIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre on the complaint of Technical Assistant Aneesur Rehman under Sections 11 (hate speech), 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person) and 26A (punishment for false and fake information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR referred to the matter of the X posts alleging the PM Shehbaz-Netanyahu meeting, as well as others.
In a statement issued today, the NCCIA said that as per the investigation, the PTI MNA had shared several fake and misleading tweets and videos.
“The content included hateful and inflammatory statements against state institutions. The accused’s tweets attempted to incite racial and linguistic hatred.
“Shandana Gulzar spread fake images and false information regarding the prime minister of Pakistan. The false report alleged a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The fake news spread fear, anxiety, and distrust among the public towards state institutions,” the NCCIA said.
“Investigations confirmed that the accused deliberately advanced an anti-state narrative through fake news.”
It added that the investigation is ongoing to identify other “individuals and accomplices behind the anti-state campaign”.</p><small>2025-10-23 03:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/230756050770673.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950700/punjab-runs-night-convoys-on-m-5-motorway-after-katcha-kidnappings' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab runs night convoys on M-5 motorway after Katcha kidnappings</strong></a><br><p>

• Two armoured vehicles lead each convoy through high-risk stretch
• 72 dacoits with over Rs60m head money surrender in Sindh
• Over 200 weapons laid down, including G3 rifles, RPG launchers and 12.7mm anti-aircraft guns
RAHIM YAR KHAN / SUKKUR: Police in Rahim Yar Khan have started running escorted night convoys on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) during the current week to protect motorists from Katcha dacoit gangs.
Traffic on the M-5 fell sharply after floods eroded a portion of the motorway near Jalalpur Pirwala in September, forcing many drivers to use the National Highway (N-5) instead. However, the traffic flow on M-5 rose again when one lane of the damaged stretch was restored and the motorway reopened via a diversion.
From 7pm to 6am, Rahim Yar Khan police are now halting all vehicles at the Azampur service area between Jamaldin Wali and Bhong and dispatching convoys every half an hour, led by two armoured police pickups. South-to-north traffic from the Sukkur side is escorted from the Guddu interchange to Azampur.
Police adopted the measure after the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped 10 people from multiple vehicles on the M-5 near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5. It was the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing the Sukkur-Multan Motorway within Punjab’s limits.
 
 

“It used to feel like the safest way to travel,” motorist Muhammad Shahid, who drove from Rahim Yar Khan to Rohri, told Dawn. “Now there’s uncertainty,” he lamented, adding that he waited about half an hour at Azampur and then crawled along with the convoy to Guddu interchange.
He added that once the limits of Sindh start, there were no convoys from Guddu to Sukkur, though Sindh police and another law enforcement agency were patrolling.
Another frequent traveller between Sukkur and Lahore said he felt uneasy on parts of the M-5, particularly between Iqbalabad and Rohri interchanges. He described Jahanpur Jungle near Qutub Din Shah service area as “the most frightening stretch where I felt extreme fear”.
RYK police spokesperson Zeeshan Rand­h­awa told Dawn the force was concerned about the safety of lives and property and had deployed bulletproof vehicles and trained personnel “equipped with modern weapons” to move traffic in convoys through high-risk areas.
Insisting that operations against robbers were ongoing, he said, “Once the area is safe, traffic will run as usual rather than in convoys.”
Ghotki SSP Anwar Khaitran told Dawn that Sindh Police had briefly used convoys in January and February last year, but now relied on temporary pickets and heavy patrolling.
“Eight Sindh Police vehicles and eight Rangers vehicles are always on the M-5, in addition to National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) units,” he said.
He added that the NHMP had written to the Punjab IG recommending convoys, but Sindh had addressed the risk through “extensive patrolling”.
SSP Khaitran stressed that government had to adopt a long-term strategy to find a permanent solution and eliminate the Katcha criminals. For this purpose, Katcha areas would be converted into Pacca areas by developing riverine areas and denying cover to criminals, he said.
Dacoits surrender

Separately, more than 70 wanted bandits surrendered under the Sindh government’s ‘Surrender Policy 2025’ at the Shikarpur SSP office on Wednesday, laying down over 200 weapons.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon, senior Rangers officers and local PPP leaders attended the ceremony.
Mr Lanjar praised the police, Rangers and cooperating tribal elders and paid tribute to the martyred officers.
Addressing the surrendering men, the minister said, “You’ve taken a commendable step. Serve your sentences and return as law-abiding citizens.”
He urged remaining gangs to accept the policy, saying it would unlock support for families in Katcha areas — from Benazir Income Support stipends to roads, schools, healthcare, veterinary services and land for homeless farmers.
Warning those still at large, he said: “Surrender, or you will be eliminated inside your hideouts.”
IGP Memon said law and order in Sindh was gradually improving. Kidnapping for ransom, a decades-long scourge, had “almost ended”, he claimed, citing a sustained crackdown since the so-called “Honey Trap Operation” began in 2012.
He said 171 dacoits had been killed and 421 captured injured during police operations.
Rangers’ Sector Commander highlighted joint operations in Katcha and pledged continued support.
DIG Larkana Nasir Aftab said the term “Katcha” had become synonymous with kidnapping and extortion, but coordinated action by police, Rangers and intelligence agencies had shifted the balance.
He said 282 suspects had applied to surrender; more than 70 approvals were issued, along with the deposit of 209 weapons at Wednesday’s ceremony.
Surrendered weapons included 62 G-3 rifles, 97 SMGs, 48 double-barrel shotguns, two RPG-7 launchers, an anti-tank RR-75 and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. Authorities said the combined head money on the surrendered men exceeded Rs60 million.
According to police, several operations had been conducted, including in Garhi Tegho (where 107 hostages were rescued over five months), Kot Shaho, Jagan, Kalhoro (Madeji) and Bagarji (Sukkur).
In Operation Bachal Bhayo, notorious dacoit Shero Mahar was killed.

• Security man loses life in landmine blast
QUETTA: At least 11 militants were killed in separate operations in Chagai and Sibi districts over the past 24 hours, whereas two police constables were martyred in Noshki, and a security official lost his life to a landmine in Kachhi, officials said on Wednesday.
Officials said security forces launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous area of Dalbandin in Chagai after reports of militants hiding there. Troops cordoned off the location and came under heavy fire. A fierce gun battle ensued and lasted about an hour, leaving six suspects dead.
“The Fitna al-Hindustan terrorists were hiding in the area and were detected through aerial reconnaissance,” officials said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the hideout. They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity.
 
 

In a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit.
CTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said.
Arms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital.
Two cops martyred
Meanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday.
Police said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass.
“Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch.
Police moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday.
In another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle.

• Azma asks PPP to rein in its Punjab leader, take notice of remarks
ISLAMABAD: Amid uncertainty over the status of the country’s main wheat-buying body, the PPP has sought clarity from the federal government on the wheat procurement mechanism after the minimum support price was recently set at Rs3,500 per 40kg.
In May this year, the federal food minister informed the National Assembly that the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) was being abolished because the market had been deregulated and the government was not buying the staple anymore.
It may be noted that in line with the IMF demand, the government had deregulated the wheat market much to the chagrin of farmers, but a decision recently overturned through the national wheat policy.
 
 

Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked the PML-N government in Punjab as to who would procure wheat and under what mechanism, following the “abolition” of Passco.
Addressing a press conference, the PPP leader said that in the absence of Passco, farmers were at the mercy of middlemen who had been buying at a price much lower than the recently announced price of Rs3,500.
Mr Murtaza also spoke about the differences with the coalition partner, PML-N, and urged the need for dialogue to resolve disagreements.
“We are allies, you (PMLN) should sit with us and talk so that these differences do not surface again,” he said. He referred to recent reports about the withdrawal of security from Lahore’s Bilawal House, which was denied by the provincial government. “If someone reported that security was removed from Bilawal House in Lahore, they (PMLN) denied it in the media and did not contact us,” he rued.
About the flood relief plan that stirred differences between the two parties, Mr Murtaza clarified that the PPP had given the government an “immediate relief plan” on the flood issue and suggested that the data of the Benazir Income Support Program be used for the purpose, but there was an uproar by the PML-N government over this suggestion.
 
 

He claimed the Punjab CM was provided inaccurate statistics regarding the floods and subsequent losses. “Farmers needed urgent money; for this, we asked you (PMLN) to use the BISP data and provide immediate assistance to the growers so that they could meet their needs,” he added.
Mr Murtaza said the PPP did not want to derail the system, adding that at least the spokespersons of the Punjab government should reconsider their choice of words.
The PPP leader also complained that research centres were not providing seeds to the farmers. “What will a poor farmer do with the limited compensation amount of Rs5,000 per acre when a bag of DAP fertiliser is available for Rs15,000,” he added.
Local govt law
He also reiterated reservations against the local government law. He said the PPP expressed reservations on the legislation as the law was “questionable”. However, the PPP will participate in the polls, he added. “We have serious reservations about the legislation, as non-party-based elections are the beginning of pre-poll rigging,” he said, adding that the PPP would soon present its strategy regarding the local bodies act. “Even if our concerns are not addressed, we will not leave the field open. The PPP will actively participate in the upcoming local government elections,” he said.
It may be noted that the Election Commission of Pakistan on Oct 21 asked the Punjab government to formulate the delimitation rules within four months in light of the new law, as it withdrew an earlier order under which polls could have been held by the end of this year.
‘Take notice’
The PML-N, however, took exception to the press conference by Mr Murtaza, particularly the criticism of the agri policies and the local government act. Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari asked the PPP to take notice of Hassan Murtaza’s remarks; otherwise, the PML-N would be compelled to respond to him.
“Whether Murtaza is conspiring against his own leadership… If anyone owes an apology, it should be to Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto, who could not even keep such defeated elements under control,” she quipped. Ms Bokhari said the PPP never missed a chance to malign the PML-N leadership.
After months of broadsides, the acrimony between the PPP and the PML-N came to an apparent end following meetings between the top leaders, including PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The PM even agreed to use BISP for flood relief, while the PPP central executive committee decided to give its ally one month’s time to make good on the ‘unfulfilled’ promises.

IN PAKISTAN, one-tola (24kt) price has plunged by Rs19,538 in the last six days.—Reuters/file

KARACHI: Gold prices in the local market continued their downward trend on Wednesday, following a sharp decline in international rates.
The prices of 10 grams and one tola of gold dropped by Rs6,463 and Rs7,538, respectively, settling at Rs374,967 and Rs437,362.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), global gold prices fell by $85 per ounce to $4,150 on Wednesday. Since last Friday, international prices have declined by $208 per ounce, resulting in a cumulative decrease of Rs19,538 in the domestic one-tola rate.
Despite the decline, demand has remained subdued. All Pakistan Jewellery Manufacturers Association Chairman Mohammad Arshad stated that despite the ongoing wedding season, customers have not returned in significant numbers.
He noted that demand had already begun to taper off when the price of gold crossed Rs400,000 per tola.
“Many people still cannot afford gold despite the recent drop,” he said, adding that it is difficult for consumers to purchase even a single tola jewellery set, which still costs around Rs450,000.
According to Reuters, gold prices fell on Wednesday to a near two-week low, following their sharpest single-day drop in five years in the previous session, as investors booked profits ahead of key US inflation data due this week.
 
 

Gold prices have notched multiple record highs and gained 54pc this year, bolstered by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, expectations of US rate cuts and strong inflows into ETFs. Prices fell 5.3pc on Tuesday, after notching a record high of $4,381.21 per ounce in the preceding session.
Friday’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, delayed due to the ongoing US government shutdown, is expected to show that core inflation held at 3.1pc in September.
Arshad said that persistently high bullion prices and weak jewellery demand have impacted manufacturing units, with around 60pc of them struggling to sustain operations. Others have scaled down their workforce due to reduced orders.
He also pointed out that investors, who had earlier purchased gold bars and coins, are now holding off on further buying, adopting a wait-and-see approach. He declined to predict future price movements, stating that much would depend on global factors, including political developments.

Subsequently, the PTI has responded that the offer can be considered if the government demonstrates its “seriousness” on the issue.
In an appearance on Asma Shirazi’s talk-show on Hum News, Federal Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry suggested that Mr Khan could be shifted to Banigala, where PTI leaders and his family members can meet him on a daily basis.
 






Later, talking to Dawn, Mr Chaudhry said that there were 8,000 prisoners in Adiala jail and they were also suffering beca­use of the PTI founder and his political activities.
“We are ready to shift him if they submit an appl­i­cation. There [at Bani­gala] PTI leaders can meet him and play Ludo and other games day and night,” the minister added.
He said that Mr Khan cannot be released, but he can be shifted to his Banigala residence by declaring it a sub-jail.
“The PTI should submit a written application to shift Imran Khan from Ad­i­­ala to Banigala. And we will do that [shift him].”
‘Will consider offer’
When approached for a reaction, PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser told Dawn that although he was unaware of such an offer, but it can be considered if the government showed its seriousness.
“I have a gut feeling that the government will backtrack on it. However, if it is serious, we can discuss the offer within the party, our legal team and also with Imran Khan. If Khan sahib gives the nod, we will defiantly submit the [written] application,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser said that the PTI founder was in jail for over two years and legally he has become entitled for bail.
“If the government is serious, it should remove pressure from the judiciary and let the bail be accepted.”
He said that as a gesture of goodwill, the government should allow PTI leaders and family members to meet Mr Khan in jail so that developments could proceed.
It is worth mentioning that in January 2024, the PTI founder’s spouse Bushra Bibi had surrendered herself before the accountability court after being sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana case. Later, she was shifted to her husband’s Banigala residence, which was declared a sub-jail.
However, Ms Bushra alleged that she was being poisoned there.
Later, she approached the Islamabad High Court, which in May last year ordered her transfer from the Banigala residence back to Adiala Jail.

• Official says Pak-EPA lacks financial, technical resources to do its job
• Senate panel urges Centre to strengthen initiatives for climate-vulnerable Gilgit-Baltistan
• Calls for sharing of early-warning data for disaster prevention in northern areas
ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Critical inadequacies in Pakistan’s environmental oversight were highlighted on Wednesday, after a parliamentary committee heard that emission standards remain frozen at Euro-II levels, a benchmark long-abandoned by most nations.
Following the revelation, the National Assembly’s Standing Comm­ittee on Climate Change and Environ­mental Coordination voiced serious concerns and directed the Ministry of Climate Change to present a mechanism for air-quality monitoring, along with a comprehensive action plan.
During the sitting, the committee received a joint briefing from the ministry and the Islamabad Capital Terri­tory administration and was informed that country’s vehicle emission limits remain at Euro-II, far below modern Euro-V and Euro-VI standards.
The panel also noted that the current National Environmental Quality Standards only correspond to Euro-II levels, which have long lost relevance given deteriorating air quality and international shifts toward Euro-V and Euro-VI benchmarks.
“There is no mechanism in place to check emissions or enforce compliance,” said MNA Munaza Hassan, who chairs the committee, characterising the situation as a fundamental failure of oversight.
The scale of the challenge became clearer when Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon told the committee that the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) — the body responsible for monitoring air quality — lacks both the financial resources and technical capacity to fulfil its mandate.
He said the agency had borrowed testing units from Punjab’s EPA, while the Capital Development Authority funded the purchase of five additional units.
Directing the climate ministry to prepare a comprehensive, time-bound air-quality improvement plan within four weeks, the committee called for increased funding and emphasised that the climate agenda must figure prominently in Pakistan’s foreign engagements.
Experts invited to the meeting said targeted management actions could reduce air pollution by up to 30 per cent.
They proposed pragmatic interventions such as staggered school and office timings, improved road infrastructure and catalytic converters for older vehicles and motorbikes.
Further recommendations included incentivising retrofitting, mandating emission testing during vehicle transfers and transitioning to Euro-V-compliant fuels.
“We should at least try to make Islamabad a model city,” Ms Hassan concluded.
More climate action in vulnerable GB
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and SAFRON decided to recommend that the federal government enhance efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the region.
The committee, chaired by Senator Asad Qasim, met in Skardu on Tuesday to discuss climate impacts, forest protection and the status of disaster-preparedness projects. “Gilgit-Baltistan is among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts,” Qasim told Dawn.
“This year, GB experienced unprecedented climate change-induced disasters. Glaciers melting, cloudbursts and glacial-lake outburst floods badly affected GB.”
Qasim said the committee’s goal is to prevent future catastrophes and address challenges faced by the local population.
“We don’t like to see these disasters again in future; we will work for mitigation of the climate change disasters,” he said. “We are listening to the challenges faced by local people from climate change impacts. We have come here to see for ourselves.”
Officials briefed the committee on forest protection efforts and were directed to share a working plan for forests.
They also called for incentives to create awareness and motivation for forest conservation within local communities.
Officials said a comprehensive legal framework is in place to protect forests and that 1.1 million cubic feet of illegal timber has been seized and a plan for its legal utilisation is being prepared.
They noted that residents often depend on wood for fuel because of a lack of electricity, but projects for clean energy generation are being completed on the prime minister’s special instructions.
The meeting was attended by Senators Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, Nasir Mahmood and Ataulhaq, GB Additional Chief Secretary Waheed Shah, Director General GB Disaster Management Authority Zakir Hussain, Commissioner Baltistan Division Kamal Khan and Deputy Commissioner Skardu Hamza Murad.
Early warning systems
A separate sitting of the Senate panel on the UNDP-funded GLOF-II and Early Warning System was also convened in Skardu to review disaster management and early-warning systems in GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
Project Head Muteeb Ali told members that of 292 early-warning stations established in GB and KP, 218 are fully functional; 77 face communication issues and civil work is underway at 23 others.
The committee directed full coordination among the Gilgit-Baltistan Disa­ster Management Auth­ority, district administrations, the Meteorological Department and the UNDP to make the system more effective.
Members also stressed that all relevant agencies should be given access to early-warning data and the dashboard to enable a timely, coordinated response during any emergency.

According to a report compiled by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), second sitting had the highest number of MNAs (200 or 61pc of the current membership) present during the session. 
The third sitting had the lowest number of MNAs in attendance (159 or 49pc). As many as 216 (66pc ) MNAs skipped at least one sitting during the session.
As Many as 50 (23pc of 216) MNAs submitted applications for leave of absence during the session. As many as 166 (77 pc of 216) MNAs skipped the House proceedings without any formal leave application in advance.
Among the cabinet members, four federal ministers and one state minister attended all the sittings. The PM did not attend any sitting, while the office of the Leader of the Opposition remained vacant during the session.
Attendance patterns by sitting
As in previous sessions, female members generally had higher attendance than their male counterparts. The second sitting saw the highest attendance, with 200 members (61pc of the current membership) present.
This session was a Private Members’ Day, during which the minister for housing and works moved motion 288 to suspend the agenda to discuss the country’s flood situation under motion 259, which had been previously introduced by the minister for parliamentary affairs in the first sitting. The lowest attendance occurred during the third (last) sitting, with only 159 members (49pc ) present. An analysis of attendance records and leave applications announced during the proceedings shows that 216 members (66pc of the current strength) missed at least one sitting during the session. However, only 50 members (23pc of those absent) submitted applications seeking leave from the House for their absence.

Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
At the same time, Pakistan has been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025.
“I have been clear right from the beginning that we have two existential issues because if we don’t tackle them correctly … there are two reasons that could derail us from becoming a $3tr economy and those are climate change and population growth,” said the finance minister in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’.
Aurangzeb said the former was no longer merely “an academic discussion” but something “we are living day in and day out”, pointing to the onset of the smog season in Lahore and the recent flood which devastated large tracts of Pakistan.
The finance czar said the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events were increasing, adding that he had participated in three forums during the last week that discussed the matter of climate change.
 
 

“There is no way to put a value on the precious human lives we have lost,” he said of the deaths in the recent floods and climate disasters overall, adding that the growth goal for this year was targeted at 4.2pc but “there is no doubt now that at least 0.4-0.5pc will be shaved off.”
He stated that 80pc of the damage caused by the recent floods was sustained in Punjab, predominantly impacting the agriculture sector, especially rice and cotton-producing regions.
Regarding the government measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, the finance minister said Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik was tasked by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to devise a plan for the next 300 days.
MNCs exiting Pakistan
 
 

Questioned about the recent high-profile departures of multinational companies from the country, Aurangzeb said there were multiple aspects to the issue.
“These global companies make decisions on their participation regarding which clients to stay with, which products to stay with and in which countries to remain.”
Mentioning his own past example, he pointed to the exit of the Royal Bank of Scotland from Pakistan, adding that the entity had decided at the time to exit all global money markets.
He further said that while some companies were indeed exiting, some entered the market during the past three to four years, pointing to Aramco and others.
There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here. Some of the prominent ones include Procter & Gamble, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10pc annually, over the last two years.
Stability but no growth due to no reforms: Miftah Ismail
Meanwhile, speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said that while stability was indeed achieved, key reforms were needed for growth but they were not carried out and instead the government had not reduced its expenses but raised taxes, thus dampening demand.
He also pointed to the lack of reduction in the share of the provinces in the National Finance Commission award as a reason for lack of growth.
The former finance minister also criticised government sprawl at the federal and provincial levels, saying: “If the government steps back just a little, the private sector will handle it.”
Ismail said there was a lack of incentive for foreign companies to enter the country with his high taxation and utility costs for gas and electricity. He added that the entire energy infrastructure of the country needed a rehaul to move away to more cheaper methods such as solar and wind.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22221726d6dd2ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950595/pakistan-will-not-travel-to-india-for-junior-hockey-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not travel to India for Junior Hockey World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Hockey Federation on Wednesday finalised its decision to not send its team to India for next month’s Junior World Cup, slated to held from Nov 28 to Dec 10.
The decision came after a high-profile meeting in Islamabad where the security issues and India’s hostile approach towards Pakistan in the sports sector, particularly the conduct of its cricket team during the recent Asia Cup, came under discussion.
“The PHF will convey its decision to Hockey India soon,” a PHF official told Dawn.com. “The PHF and the government don’t want to compromise on security of players, therefore we decided not to send our team.”
International Cricket Council, the sports global body, has arranged for neutral venues for both Pakistan and India during tournaments held in either country. Hockey’s governing body, the FIH, however, hasn’t made any such hybrid arrangement. Pakistan skipped the Asia Cup in India last month despite the tournament being a qualifier for next year’s World Cup.
Meanwhile, the issue of PHF elections was taken by the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter Provincial Coordination, which met here at under the Chairmanship of MNA Sheikh Aftab Ahmed.
During the course of meeting, the convener of sub-committee presented a report on the PHF. The committee was told that the PHF had agreed to conduct the scrutiny of clubs and elections of committee.
During the meeting, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid told the committee that issue of elections of PHF and scrutiny of clubs will be placed before the Executive Committee of PHF in its meeting on November 7 and a subsequent announcement will be made.
The committee directed the PHF that the election commission should be formed with representation of Pakistan Sports Board while club scrutiny should be carried out with consultation and representation of PSB.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:18</small></div><hr>
