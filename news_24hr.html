“Eight fatalities and 13 survivors,” Governor Jorginho Mello said on X.
 






Videos taken by bystanders and carried on Brazilian television showed the moment when the balloon erupted in flames above the coastal town of Praia Grande. The weather conditions were clear. The basket carrying the passengers plummeted dozens of meters to the ground in flames.
“We still have no information” about the condition of the survivors, a spokeswoman for Santa Catarina firefighters told AFP.
Praia Grande, on the Atlantic coast, is a popular destination for hot-air ballooning in Brazil.

The survivors were being treated in area hospitals, firefighters said. An investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accident.
“I want to express my solidarity with the families of the victims,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in a statement.
The pilot told officials that the fire was sparked by a blowtorch in the basket, Tiago Luiz Lemos, a police official in Praia Grande, told local media.
The pilot tried to bring the balloon down as soon as the fire erupted, “and once it was close to the ground, he told the passengers to jump from the basket. But some of them couldn’t do it and the fire grew,” the official said.
One witness told the Razao newspaper that he saw “two people falling, they were on fire, the basket broke off and the balloon fell”.
It was the second fatal balloon accident in the country in just a few days. Less than a week ago, a woman died during a ride in southeastern Sao Paulo state.</p><small>2025-06-21 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610318-malala-pledges-daily-fight-for-122-million-out-of-school-girls' target='_blank'><strong>Malala pledges daily fight for 122 million out-of-school girls</strong></a><br><p>

Delhi unilaterally suspended its participation in the 1960 IWT, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.
“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told The Times of India earlier today. “We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.”
 
 

The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, reveal Delhi’s intentions as Islamabad hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.
Responding to Shah’s comments, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said they reflected “a brazen disregard for the sanctity of international agreements” and noted that the IWT is an apolitical agreement without provisions for unilateral action.
“India’s illegal announcement to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a clear violation of international law, the provisions of the treaty itself, and the fundamental principles governing inter-state relations,” the FO stated.
 






“Such conduct sets a reckless and dangerous precedent — one that undermines the credibility of international agreements and raises serious questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of a state that openly refuses to fulfil its legal obligations.”
The FO added that “weaponising water for political ends” is irresponsible and contrary to the behaviour of a responsible state. It demanded that India immediately restore the full implementation of the IWT.
“For its part, Pakistan remains firmly committed to the treaty and will take all necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and entitlements under it,” the statement concluded.
Addressing a crowd of supporters on Friday night, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT, warning that if it refused to honour the treaty, “we will fight another war and take all six rivers. We know how to defend our rivers.”
 
 

Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.
 


Last month, Reuters reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.
The FO did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments, but it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “an act of war”.
Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.
FM Dar slams India’s ‘provocative and inflammatory’ statements
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Shah’s “provocative and inflammatory” comments on the IWT, warning that stopping Pakistan’s water will be considered an act of war.
“Pakistan is taking all necessary steps to ensure regional stability,” Dar told the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting hosted by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The provocative and inflammatory statements being made by the Indian leadership, as well as India’s unilateral and illegal actions, especially its decision to hold the IWT in abeyance, represent an intent to further destabilise the region,” he said.
“Let me state categorically that Pakistan will not allow India to stop water for our people. It will be treated as an act of war.”
Held Kashmir’s CM opposes diverting waters to other states
Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state’s waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India’s  Telegraph reported.
“Nobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,” Abdullah told reporters.
Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.
“Why should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” he was quoted as having said.
Omar referred to Punjab’s purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. “We were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years…. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-21 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/212029346b24a28.jpg?r=203122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918723/new-zealand-retain-fih-hockey-nations-cup-with-6-2-win-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>New Zealand retain FIH Hockey Nations Cup with 6-2 win over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>New Zealand beat Pakistan 6-2 in the final of the FIH Nations Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Saturday to retain their title.
New Zealand launched a blitz early on in the match with five goals in the first half.

New Zealand’s hockey federation said “a statement had been made” with the win.
“The Vantage Black Sticks men have claimed the victory at the 2025 FIH Nations Cup Grand final.
“An electrifying match and a huge effort from the team to secure the win and become back-to-back champions!”

“A tough end to a spirited campaign. Pakistan fought bravely in the final of the Nations Cup but New Zealand came out on top with a 6-2 win,” the Pakistan Hockey Federation said in a post on Facebook.
“Despite the scoreline, Pakistan showed heart, hustle, and moments of brilliance throughout the match — including various attacking opportunities, a strong goal, and resilience under pressure. The Green Shirts also had to endure controversial decisions early on, yet they played with pride till the very end.
“Heads held high — this is just the beginning of a comeback story. Well played, Team Pakistan!” it said.
The match began shortly after 6pm. New Zealand had reached the final after edging Korea in a shootout in the other semi-final.
Pakistani fans were in the stands to see the national team.

In a pulsating semi-final clash at the National Hockey Stad­ium, Pakistan had staged a stunning comeback a day ago and overcame France 3-2 on penalties to book their place in the final.
It was a match that saw the Green Shirts display a blend of youthful flair, tactical discipline and mental resilience. Down 2-0 midway through the third quarter, Pakistan clawed their way back into the contest through a sequence of brilliantly orchestrated goals, eventually forcing a shootout after a 3-3 deadlock in regulation time.
“We were ready for this win for a long time,” Player of the Match Rana Waheed had said after the final whistle. “Everything we have — we gave everything. [We are] thankful to Allah Almighty for helping us. We are really proud of the team and looking forward to the finals now.”
The win over France was especially significant, given Pakistan’s dramatic journey to the semi-finals. Despite a 4-3 defeat to New Zealand in their final group game — in which they had led 3-1 — Pakistan advanced ahead of hosts Malaysia on goal difference. Both teams had ended with four points, but Pakistan’s tally of nine goals edged Malaysia’s eight.
Pakistan’s Nations Cup campaign had begun with a thrilling 3-3 draw against Malaysia, followed by a convincing 5-2 victory over Japan. Although they faltered against New Zealand, they did enough across their group matches to qualify for the knockouts.</p><small>2025-06-21 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2120522430f199b.jpg?r=205233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918738/ogra-advises-oil-marketing-companies-to-ensure-maintenance-of-mandatory-20-day-stock-levels' target='_blank'><strong>Ogra advises oil marketing companies to ensure maintenance of mandatory 20-day stock levels</strong></a><br><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Saturday advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels amid the impact of the Iran-Israel conflict on global oil supply.
In a statement issued today, the authority’s spokesperson said: “Ogra has confirmed that the country currently holds sufficient stocks of petroleum products to meet existing demand.
 
 

“However, in view of anticipated future requirements and the prevailing market situation, Ogra has formally advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels, in line with the conditions stipulated in their respective licences.”
The spokesperson said Ogra remained committed to monitoring the situation closely and would continue to take proactive steps to ensure national energy security.
A high-level meeting on Monday reviewed petroleum products prices and supply dynamics in response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel’s recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets.
The committee was constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with a task to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the first meeting of the committee in the Finance Division.
An official announcement said that the committee meeting was attended by senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts. The formation of this committee reflects the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.
During the meeting, the members assessed the global and domestic petroleum market situation. The committee expressed satisfaction that Pakistan currently held adequate stocks of petroleum products and there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.
However, members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.
To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the full committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.
The committee has been entrusted with the tasks to closely monitor the forward/futures prices of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region. IT will also determine Forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term.
According to the terms of reference of the committee, it will suggest a plan (if required) to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact, in the event of a protracted conflict.
The Petroleum Division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee’s mandate.
The government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time, added the announcement.</p><small>2025-06-21 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610288-pakistan-slams-indias-iwt-stance-as-reckless-violation-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan slams India's IWT stance as ‘reckless violation of international law'</strong></a><br><p>

The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against Riaz, who is also an absconder in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust Case.
According to the order — dated June 19 and seen by Dawn.com — 457 immoveable properties belonging to various individuals and entities have been frozen under Section 12 (power to freeze property), read with Section 34A (delegation of powers) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.
Referring to an investigation against “accused persons”, the order read: “It transpired that accused persons in active connivance with each other have usurped the government land admeasuring 16,896 acres situated in District Malir, Karachi,” stating that they violated Section 9A (the offence of corruption and corrupt practice) of the NAO.
According to the order, five properties owned by Bahria Town in DHA Rawalpindi; two properties owned by Ahmed Ali Riaz in Islamabad; and 18 properties owned by Bahria Town in Islamabad have been frozen, making a total of 25.
Two properties owned by Riaz’s son-in-law, Zain Malik, were also listed.
The order will remain in place for 15 days, though it will “continue to subsist until the accountability court adjudicates upon the same as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment reported as 2019 SCMR 1106”, the document read.
Earlier this month, an accountability court on issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of controversial property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son and others in the Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) land grab case.
NAB had filed a reference a few months ago against the owners of Bahria Town, senior PPP leaders and government officials for allegedly converting, exchanging, and transferring government land to Bahria Town for its BTK project.</p><small>2025-06-21 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/21171157ff478af.jpg?r=171339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918726/tarar-stresses-exemplary-punishment-for-sana-yousufs-killer' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar stresses ‘exemplary punishment’ for Sana Yousuf’s killer</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that social media influencer Sana Yousuf’s killer should receive an exemplary punishment and that this should be a “test case” so that no such crime occurs in the future.
Islamabad Police arrested Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old’s murder, on June 3, nearly a day after she was gunned down in her house in the federal capital. Police claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances. An Islamabad court on Friday extended Hayat’s physical remand for another three days.
Tarar visited Yousuf’s home and extended condolences to her family, telling them that the prime minister and the interior minister had taken strict notice of the murder. He noted that the police arrested the suspect within hours of the incident and lauded the investigation.
“The culprit should get the strictest punishment to make an example,” Tarar told reporters outside the house, adding that the family has a “good legal team” and a strong case.
“The important thing now is to ensure there are no gaps in the prosecution or trial process and that everything moves forward smoothly,” the minister added. “Our lawyers and the Lawyers’ Forum will go with their legal team and provide support.
“I was here not just to express my grief, but also to give the family hope,” Tarar said.
 






Responding to a question, the information minister said that social media platforms should be used responsibly and their negative use should be discouraged, given that they can have “damaging impacts”.
“Girls can get blackmailed and harassed, or even fall victim to violence,” he stated. “It is time for legislation to protect young girls. We have to provide a forum for their protection and awareness.”
In a post on X, he said: “Those making videos on this tragedy must also stand with the family and the state in court during proceedings.”
 






The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from citizens, celebrities and President Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter, MNA Aseefa.
“Sana was just a girl — with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”</p><small>2025-06-21 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/21161733632f264.jpg?r=172018' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918704/govt-appoints-naveed-asghar-as-acting-wapda-chairman' target='_blank'><strong>Govt appoints Naveed Asghar as acting Wapda chairman</strong></a><br><p>Naveed Asghar Chaudhry has been appointed to the position of acting chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), according to a notification issued by the Ministry of Water Resources on Saturday.
The appointment of Asghar follows the resignation of retired Lieutenant General Sajjad Ghani earlier in the day. Ghani served in the role for almost three years before stepping down.
Asghar previously served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022 after retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to retired Lt Gen Ghani three months later.
He will now serve again as Wapda chairman “for a period of three months or until the appointment of [a] regular chairman […] with immediate effect and until further orders”, the ministry said.
Asghar will take on the position in addition to his current role as Wapda’s Member (Finance) under the Water Resources Division.
Asghar previously accompanied Ghani as he visited the sites of major projects during his time as chairman, such as the construction of Mohmand Dam on the River Swat.
In May, Ghani visited the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project — located approximately 41km from Muzaffarabad — after the dam site was damaged in Indian attacks a day earlier.
He strongly condemned the attack, saying, “International laws, including the Geneva Convention, do not allow attacking water structures even during a full-scale war.”
 
 

Also in May, he persuaded the participants of a jirga to call off a two-week sit-in, assuring them that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constituted a committee to address the concerns of families whose land had been acquired for the Dasu hydropower project.
Dasu residents also staged protests in February and April this year, presenting various demands, including the immediate release of payments under a relocation package
In April, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) highlighted glaring inefficiencies and massive financial mismanagement in key national hydropower projects, in particular the Dasu Hydropower Project and the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project.
The next month, Ghani claimed that a number of key targets in the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, better known as the K-IV Project, had been achieved.
Underlining the importance of the K-IV Project for Karachi, which was formally launched in 2011, he had directed the project team to accelerate construction activities to meet the deadlines.
 
 

However, the project immediately faced a new setback this month, as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.</p><small>2025-06-21 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/21034204fdaa0b3.jpg?r=034245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-pak-india-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to recommend Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for ‘decisive diplomatic intervention’ in Pak-India crisis</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistani government said on Saturday it has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during the recent India-Pakistan crisis.
The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.
In a post shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.
 






Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.
It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.
The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.
It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.
“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.
 
 

The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere offers” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.
“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.
The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.
In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating escalation involving Iran.
Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained in a recent conversation with Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two countries’ militaries and not US mediation.
Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
 
 

Mushahid Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, suggested nominating Trump for the peace prize was justified.
“Trump is good for Pakistan,” Reuters quoted him as saying. “If this panders to Trump’s ego, so be it. All the European leaders have been sucking up to him big time.”
However, Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, termed the decision “unfortunate”.
“A man who has backed Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza and called Israel’s attack on Iran as ‘excellent’. This move does not reflect the views of the people of Pakistan,” Lodhi wrote on X.
 


“It compromises our national dignity,” she wrote in response to Jamaat-i-Islami chief Naeemur Rehman, who expressed his agreement with the envoy’s previous post.
 


Trump complains about not getting Nobel prize for ‘stopping’ multiple wars
Shortly later, in a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.
“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia,” he said.
Trump campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.
 
 

Trump’s claims for the Abraham Accords being able to “unify the Middle East” have yet to be realised, with war breaking out between Israel and Iran, and no end in sight to the relentless bombardment by US ally Israel in Gaza.
Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.
He has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award, bringing it up as recently as February during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Former US president Barack Obama won the prize soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.

The DGCA directive noted that the airline’s voluntary disclosures “point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability”.
“Of particular concern is the absence of strict disciplinary measures against key officials directly responsible for these operational lapses,” said the order, which was issued on Friday.
“These officials have been involved in serious and repeated lapses,” it said.
 
 

The regulator has directed Air India to remove three officials named in the order “from all roles and responsibilities related to crew scheduling”, take disciplinary action, and report on steps taken within 10 days.
Future violations could also result in “licence suspension”.
The airline said on Saturday it had implemented the order.
“Air India is committed to ensuring that there is total adherence to safety protocols and standard practices,” it said in a statement.
Investigators are attempting to find out what caused the airline’s London-bound plane to hurtle to the ground moments after takeoff in Ahmedabad.
Air India said on Thursday that the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane was “well-maintained” and that the pilots were accomplished flyers.
The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder have been recovered from the crash site.</p><small>2025-06-21 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/211633032ed8237.jpg?r=163334' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714/terrorist-killed-2-more-injured-after-targeting-police-party-in-kps-di-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist killed, 2 more injured after targeting police party in KP’s DI Khan</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group on Saturday in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
A statement issued from the police said  the TTP terrorists targeted a police party near the Malang area within the jurisdiction of Hathala Police Station as they were returning from duty in the Takwara area.
“The police retaliated vigorously and repelled the terrorists’ attack. In the retaliatory action of the Dera Police, an active terrorist of the banned TTP-Gandapur group … was killed while two more terrorists were injured,” the statement said.
It added that District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada led a police contingent, including the Saddar superintendent of police and DIK Police, and launched a search and strike operation to arrest the injured terrorists upon reaching the scene.
The statement said KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed congratulated the Dera Police for standing as a wall against the terrorists and announced rewards for the officers and soldiers involved in the successful operation.
He said the terrorists would be chased down and eliminated at every location for the establishment of lasting peace in the country, especially in KP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Two months ago, KP saw a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur. In particular, Lakki Marwat has seen a growing military presence in recent months, yet the frequency of attacks has continued to rise despite efforts by local peace bodies to maintain order.</p><small>2025-06-21 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610260-india-says-it-will-never-restore-indus-waters-treaty-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India says it will never restore Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

However, the former senator was sent to judicial jail for 14 days and will be produced before the court again on July 4, 2025, after the completion of his judicial remand.
Chaudhry Tanveer has been charged in the murder case of former parliamentary secretary and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) member of the provincial assembly, Adnan Chaudhry.
He was taken into custody on Tuesday after his counsel informed Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan of the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench that they were withdrawing the pre-arrest bail application and had decided to join the police investigation in the case.
Following the withdrawal of the bail petition, the police took Chaudhry Tanveer into custody in accordance with the bail cancellation order issued by the subordinate court.
 
 

He was later produced before a local court, which granted a two-day physical remand.
On Friday, after the completion of the physical remand, Tanveer Khan was presented before Judicial Magistrate Ahsan Raza amid tight security, as police sought further remand.
The counsel for the accused opposed the police’s request, arguing that his client had already joined the investigation and recorded his statement with the investigating officer.

The court had ordered registration of cases against the police officials after receiving complaints from public but the police stations concerned had been dragging their feet over the FIRs for over a month. Finally, the judge took the extraordinary step to have the cases filed in his presence.
Shikarpur SSP and his PRO did not respond to Dawn’s queries when this reporter contacted them to get their comment.
A case was lodged on Ms Irshad Lehar’s complaint against Khanpur DSP Rana Nasrullah, Khanpur SHO Tufail Ahmadani, New Faujdari SHO Akhtar Abro, District Police IT Branch In-charge Saifullah Chandio, head constable Abdullah Shah and others under sections 395, 365, 427, 454, 148, 149, and 220 of the PPC on charges of committing house robbery.

Head muharrars summoned to court to write FIRs against police officials

The complainant stated in the FIR that about 15 to 20 persons, including the nominated police officials, arrived in her locality on police mobile vans and motorcycles, barged into her home violating the sanctity of chador and char deewari, damaged property, and robbed the family of Rs1,350,000 cash, three tolas of gold, a licensed rifle with 60 bullets, an ATM card, a checkbook, various documents and men’s and women’s clothing.
 
 

A similar case was registered at Garhi Yaseen police station on the judge’s intervention in which Deen Muhammad Eisani accused SHO Hidayatullah Nandwani, his son Imran Nandwani and other police officials of forcing into his house and robbing the inmates of their valuable belongings.
Shikarpur police had been dragging their feet on registering cases against their colleagues despite having received the court’s orders for almost a month.
Ms Irshad had been raising voice at different platforms in the district against police failure to register her case and finally moved the court for justice.
As the judge received similar complaints from others and police failure to enforce court’s earlier orders, the judge summoned the head muharrirs of the police stations concerned along with the FIR registers to the court, and had them lodge cases against the accused police officials in his presence.

The most affected variety is Chaunsa, which is also called Samar Bahisht in Rahim Yar Khan and Multan areas.
Similarly, the impact of Iran-Israel war has also totally suspended the export of Sindhri mango variety, a favourite in Iran.
There are many mango orchards in Rahimabad, Bhong, Jamaldinwali, Sheikh Wahan, Yousafabad, Mianwali Qureshian, Sardar Garh, Zahirpir, Khanbela and Taranda Muhammad Pannah in district Rahim Yar Khan where the fruit is cultivated on over more than 60,000 acres of land.
According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (Smeda), there are around 2,300 to 2,500 orchards of medium and large size growing in Rahim Yar Khan and there about 2,300 growers in the area. Some sources give the estimate of total mango production from Rahim Yar Khan alone as 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes.

Yield is estimated to be 45pc less this season: Iran-Israel war affects exports

Although the mango orchard owners have mainly the variety of Chaunsa, which is most sweet and delicious and popular among most of the people in the country, there are also other varieties, including Dussehri, Malda, Lahotiya, Anwar Ratol, Langra, Sanglafia, Tota Pari, Kala Chaunsa, Sufaid Chaunsa and Desi. The yield of Dussehri, Sindhri and Anwar Ratol is less by up to 30pc but the most affected variety is Chaunsa, says Jam Farooq Ahmed Ganga, a mango orchard owner in Yousufabad in Rahim Yar Khan along the National Highway.
Speaking to Dawn, he says that last year the mango yield was comparatively better but it is 40 to 50pc less than normal this year.
According to him, the main reason is climate change as in the months of February and March when the temperature of day was high and at night, it was low. This change in temperature affected the flowering process. Similarly, the weather condition was more suitable for the pests like thrips and hoppers which attacked the fruit.
“This year, the mango farmer was very much happy because there were no windstorms in the district but still there was less yield of mango.”
Muhammad Yousuf, a trader who purchases the mango orchards on lease on a yearly basis in the Sheikh Wahan and Pallo Shah areas, says that the mango orchard rates are higher this year. He says that the mango orchard owners were demanding Rs1m to Rs3m more for the last year. Regarding expenses, he says, “Last year, there were expenses of Rs3m on a mango orchard worth Rs30m but this year, the expenses increased to Rs4.5m.”
Yousuf told that in the start of mango season the rate of mango was better in big cities and it was also being exported to Iran but after the start of the Iran-Israel war, the export closed. He adds, “The export rate of Sindhri was Rs7,500 per 40kg which has dropped to Rs5,000 per 40kg now. Similarly, the 10kg crate of Sindhri was Rs2,200 which is now Rs1,200 and the crate of Dussehri was Rs1,500 but it’s now being sold at Rs900 to Rs1,000,”
Aun Muhammad, a resident of Rahim Yar Khan who works in a mango juice and pulp factory in Karachi, says that this year they are purchasing mango at Rs300 to Rs500 per 40kg rate. He says that during the current year, the mango of Rahim Yar Khan matured on time but the mango of Multan division has not matured yet which affects its sweetness and weight. “The price of pulp, which is mostly exported, will ultimately increase due to less production of mango,” he predicts.
Mian Arshad, a mango farmer of Chak Abbas, says there is no horticulture specialist in the agriculture department in Rahim Yar Khan to guide the mango farmers for maximum yield.
He says there is neither any grading or packing plant at the government level in the district nor any cargo flights from the Sheikh Zayed International Airport (SZIP) that’s why the exporters of Karachi, Lahore and Multan are earning the best profits compared to hardworking mango farmers of his area.

Section 144 is a legal provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
A Punjab Home Department order issued on Friday, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the section was imposed to prevent “disruption of public peace and instability”, along with ensuring the public’s “safety and security of lives and property”.
The notification cited “potential threat to the public peace and tranquillity, religious harmony, and general law and order situation in the province from miscreants, violent extremists, and antisocial elements”.
For the first 10 days of Muharram, which is likely to begin on June 27 or 28 in Pakistan, the government has prohibited “innovations of Muharram processions [and] majalis”.
It has also banned carrying any article that may be used as a weapon of offence — including bamboo sticks (batons), knives, daggers and spears — as well as combustible material at public places without a competent authority’s permission.
There will also be a complete ban on slogans and gestures “that may incite public sentiments, or directly or indirectly hit the belief of any sect, community or group”.
Dissemination of information or making “abusive or derogatory remarks through any information system or device” that provoke or are likely to provoke interfaith, sectarian or racial hatred will be prohibited as well.
 
 

Spectators will be barred from the rooftops of buildings on the routes and in front of shops located along the routes during processions, the order added. It further banned the construction of morchas (firing bays) on rooftops of such buildings and the collection of stones, bricks, bottles or garbage along the procession routes.
On Muharram 9 and 10, pillion riding will also be prohibited except for senior citizens, women and law enforcement personnel, the order added.
Mobile jamming, ban on ‘firebrand’ orators sought
The Punjab home department has started taking measures, including deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.
It has sought each district’s need for army and Rangers troops, along with requirements for mobile jamming, with specific location and duration. It has also stated that a ban on loudspeakers should be fully enforced under the Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act 2015 during Muharram.
Deputy commissioners have been asked to discuss and develop contingency plans, update lists of firebrand orators to be gagged or banned, and prevent misuse of loudspeakers during the month.
The DCs have also been informed about the guidelines for setting up sabeels.
 
 

In Rawalpindi, five companies of the Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed to help the administration and police maintain law and order.
The district administration has banned the entry of 169 religious leaders and zakireen in the district and also issued gagging orders for 89 clerics during Muharram. As many as 184 people have been placed in the Fourth Schedule.
Section 144 was also imposed during Muharram in Punjab last year, with the Pakistan Army and Rangers being deployed across the country after requests from all provincial governments.
While the Punjab government had also requested the interior ministry to shut down social media apps from Muharram 6 to 11 in a bid to avoid sectarian violence, the ministry had deferred the decision. However, Facebook was reportedly restricted across Pakistan on Muharram 10, Yaum-i-Ashura.
In the past, militants have targeted Muharram processions several times, including a bomb blast that killed more than 40 people attending the main Ashura procession on Karachi’s MA Jinnah Road in December 2009.</p><small>2025-06-21 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6855ed79e1e62.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918620/putin-quips-whole-of-ukraine-is-ours-eyes-buffer-zone' target='_blank'><strong>Putin quips ‘whole of Ukraine is ours’, eyes ‘buffer zone’</strong></a><br><p>ST PETERSBURG: Russian President Vladimir Putin quipped on Friday that in his view the whole of Ukraine was “ours” and cautioned that advancing Russian forces could take the Ukrainian city of Sumy as part of a bid to carve out a buffer zone along the border.
Putin, who ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022 after eight years of fighting in the country’s east, also said he was not seeking the capitulation of Ukraine or denying its sovereignty, but that Ukraine had to be neutral.
Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea, more than 99 per cent of the Luhansk region, over 70pc of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fragments of the Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions.
Asked about fresh Russian advances, Putin told the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and  “in that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours”.
Kyiv and its Western allies say Moscow’s claims to four Ukrainian regions and Crimea are illegal, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly rejected the notion that Russians and Ukrainians are one people.
He has also said that Putin’s terms for peace are akin to capitulation.
Putin said on Friday he was not questioning Ukraine’s independence or its people’s striving for sovereignty, but he underscored that when Ukraine declared independence as the Soviet Union fell in 1991, it had also declared its neutrality.

London’s Metropolitan Police banned protesters from gathering in the area in west London after seven men were arrested  “on suspicion of grievous bodily harm”.
The Met said two people had been treated at the scene and taken to hospital. Their injuries were not life-threatening. The fighting was thought to have broken out within the protesting group.
Protesters opposing Iran’s clerical leadership had gathered outside the embassy in west London since Sunday, hanging up flags from the nation’s ousted monarchy alongside some Israeli flags.
They support the exiled Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s pro-Western monarchy toppled by the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Photos published by The Telegraph showed two men receiving medical attention on the road beside the encampment.
One more man was arrested on suspicion of breaching the ban on protest outside the embassy after the altercation.
Meanwhile, The UK said Friday it had withdrawn its embassy staff from Iran on the eighth day of the war with Israel, as the US mulled whether to enter the conflict.
“Due to the current security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw our UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

• Age limit to be fully removed from July 2026; quality standards to remain mandatory
• 40pc regulatory duty to end by 2029  • Panel sends its proposals to Senate
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb informed a parliamentary committee on Friday that restrictions on commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old will be lifted from September, in line with an International Monetary Fund condition and as part of a tariff strategy to gradually phase out overprotected sectors.
As of July 1, 2026, the age limit for importing used cars and vehicles will be lifted entirely. However, while age restrictions will end, strict compliance with quality standards will remain mandatory.
Although the matter was not listed on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue’s agenda, the minister disclosed the government’s four-year roadmap for used vehicle imports, which aims to align tax treatment for used and new vehicles.
 
 

The committee meeting was chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
The committee concluded its morning session by addressing pending agenda items, while the evening session focused on finalising recommendations to be presented in the Senate on Saturday.
Used vehicle imports
The finance minister announced that Pakistan will resume commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old, signalling a major shift in trade policy. He noted that the move could enhance the competitiveness of the auto sector and increase access to imported vehicles for the middle class, as the country fulfils its global fiscal obligations and adapts to evolving domestic demand.
Currently, commercial imports are restricted, even for cars that are just a month old. Under the Baggage Rules, only vehicles up to three years old — and up to five years for categories other than cars — are permitted for import by overseas Pakistanis under certain conditions.
 
 

Commerce ministry officials briefed the Senate committee that by the first quarter (July-September) of the new fiscal year, the government will issue a notification allowing commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old.
These imports will be subject to a 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to existing duties and taxes on new vehicles. From July 1, 2026, this duty will be gradually reduced: to 30pc in 2026, 20pc in 2027, 10pc in 2028, and fully eliminated by July 1, 2029. There will be no restrictions on importing any type of used vehicles, including heavy bikes.
It remains unclear whether the additional regulatory duty will apply to cars and other vehicles up to five years old imported under the Baggage Rules — specifically the Transfer of Residence and Gift schemes. Currently, the Baggage Rules permit the import of cars up to three years old and other vehicles up to five years old, subject to certain conditions.
It was clarified that vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme will require a minimum overseas residency of 700 days to qualify for exemptions.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, imports of used vehicles will continue to be subject to environmental and quality standards. However, from July 2026, while the age limit will be lifted for commercial imports, quality requirements will remain in force.
 
 

Currently, new car imports attract high duties and taxes. As part of ongoing tariff reforms, these levies will be reduced over the next five years, eventually capping at a maximum of 15pc. By the end of this period, the phased reduction of duties on new vehicles and the gradual removal of additional regulatory duties on used vehicles will be aligned.
Public Finance Management Act
Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee rejected the finance ministry’s proposed amendments to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), arguing that existing legislation already empowers institutions through parliament.
The ministry was directed to return with a formal draft of the revisions.
Finance ministry officials disclosed that when funds were requested from the Port Qasim Authority, the request was denied and the ministry was advised to contact the relevant department. A follow-up letter received no reply.
During proceedings, Senator Anusha Rahman sought clarification on the terms “surplus profit” and “idle cash”. Officials explained that surplus profit refers to annual financial gains, while idle cash denotes unutilised funds held in accounts during the fiscal year.
Senator Rahman recommended that companies be included within the scope of the PFMA alongside autonomous bodies — a suggestion the ministry accepted.
Meanwhile, the FBR provided an update on ongoing customs reforms to the committee.
The Member Customs Operations rep­orted that customs duties have been red­u­ced on 35pc of tariff lines, while new duty slabs of 5pc, 10pc and 15pc are being proposed to replace the existing 3pc, 11pc and 16pc tiers.
Additionally, duties will be eliminated on 916 more tariff lines, raising the total number of zero-rated lines to 3,117.

• Exclusive clubs charging Rs1m or more membership fees brought under tax net
• Arrest powers of tax officials curbed; prior approval and inquiry mandatory
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday rejected a proposal to fix a uniform rate for rental valuation of commercial properties, while endorsing another measure to expand the tax net to high-end clubs nationwide and reinforce safeguards against tax fraud.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance resumed deliberations on the Finance Bill 2025 on Friday, as Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and his team addressed queries raised by committee members. The session was chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who provided input on various provisions of the Bill.
On the issue of a uniform 4 per cent rental valuation rate on commercial properties, MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig urged the tax authority to lower the proposed rate, a suggestion FBR chairman countered by insisting the rate could not be reduced.
 






Mr Rashid noted that under the existing arrangements, tax officers held discretionary power to determine rental valuations. “If the committee is unwilling to delegate authority of the uniform rate, we are prepared to withdraw the proposal altogether,” said the FBR Chairman.
MNA Usama Mela said that a 4pc rate might be feasible in urban centres but would pose challenges for rural areas.
The FBR chairman responded that the system should be allowed to operate for one fiscal year and, if ineffective, adjustments could be made in the subsequent fiscal year’s budget. He emphasised that FBR’s property valuations are significantly more accurate than traditional Deputy Commissioner (DC) rates and noted the law allows room for further revisions.
MNA Naveed Qamar echoed the need for flexibility, suggesting that adjustments could be made where rates appear excessive.  However, FBR officials announced the withdrawal of the proposed measure following resistance from committee members.
Elite clubs and e-commerce
The FBR chairman informed the NA committee that clubs charging Rs1 million or more for membership — including the prestigious Islamabad Club — will now be brought within the income tax net. These clubs will be required to file detailed income and expenditure statements, aligning with broader fiscal transparency objectives.
 
 

Mr Rashid said the move targets exclusive membership facilities that have so far operated outside formal tax oversight. “Only clubs demanding at least Rs1m for new memberships will fall under this new compliance regime,”, the chairman clarified.
MNA Muhammad Mobeen Arif also voiced concern over low taxation on e-commerce, warning of potential misuse. He stated that FBR will levy 1pc tax on online sales compared to 5pc on shopkeepers. The FBR chairman clarified that a team is working to identify the disparity.
The committee considered the proposed amendments to The Stamp Act 1899. After detailed deliberations, the committee recommended that the amendments, as revised and proposed by the committee, be passed by the Assembly.
The committee considered the proposed amendments to The Registration Act 1908. At the very outset, the ministry expressed its intention to withdraw the said amendments. Accordingly, the committee acceded to the request and allowed the withdrawal.
The committee examined the proposed amendments to The Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. After detailed deliberations, the committee approved certain proposed amendments and suggested additional corrections and revisions to several clauses. Due to paucity of time, the committee deferred consideration of the remaining provisions of the Bill to the next meeting.
Tax officials’ arrest powers
State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani declared on the floor of the National Assembly that arrests at the inquiry stage in sales tax cases will no longer occur.
Acting on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directives to address business community concerns, the government has amended arrest clauses in sales tax laws based on recommendations from Farooq H. Naik and the standing committee.
He further said that key changes include no arrests for sales tax fraud below 50 million. Mandatory approval from a three-member FBR committee before any arrest, ensuring citizen protection. Individuals accused of sales tax fraud will now be guaranteed a right to a hearing. The discretionary arrest powers previously held by tax officials have been revoked, he further clarified.
 
 

Earlier, FBR issued a statement to clear its position on the legal provisions for the arrest of those involved in tax fraud, which have already been provided under Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act 1990 along with an elaborate procedure to be followed after the arrest which involves intimating the Special Judge immediately and the production of such person before Special Judge within 24 hours.
However, the proposed amendment now restricts the powers of the officer to arrest by making a prior inquiry after approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR). Only based on the findings of the inquiry will CIR authorise the investigation, which would give the investigation officer the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898). The arrest can only be made with the prior approval of CIR if the investigation officer has reasons to believe that a tax fraud may have been committed by a person.
The new legal provision further provides that if the arrest is mala fide, the matter will be referred to the Chief Commissioner for fact-finding inquiry. This shows that in contrast to the earlier provision where an Assistant CIR could arrest an offender, the new provisions bring transparency in the process by a mandatory prior inquiry and investigation and finally permission by the CIR.
Moreover, certain changes and amendments are also necessary to reassure the compliant taxpayers that the state deals with those evading taxes or involved in tax fraud with an iron hand.

“Present a business plan for PNSC within two weeks, which should include a strategy to save the annual $4 billion burden on the national exchequer,” PM Shehbaz directed the authorities while presiding over a high-level meeting regarding matters related to the corporation.
The prime minister also directed the authorities to acquire ships on lease to expand the PNSC fleet.
“Due to a reduced number of ships in the PNSC fleet, the country has to spend approximately $4bn annually from the national exchequer on maritime trade.”
 






The prime minister was informed that PNSC currently possessed 10 ships of various types, with a combined cargo-carrying capacity of 724,643 tonnes.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and senior PNSC officials.

• Includes $6.89bn in fresh inflows; rest are rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and UAE
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan secured nearly $20bn in foreign loans and grants during the first 11 months (July-May) of 2024-25, surpassing the annual target of $19.2bn set for the fiscal year ending June 30.
Almost half of this amount comprised legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, while fresh loans and grant inflows totalled $6.89bn — about 9pc lower than the same period last fiscal year.
According to the Economic Affairs Division’s (EAD) monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the total FEA during July-May stood at $6.89bn, compared to $7.55bn in the corresponding period of last year, against a target of $19.4bn for 2024-25 and $17.6bn last year.
This figure does not include approximately $2bn received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in two tranches under the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which is recorded separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Including rollovers and IMF disbursements, total external assistance reached $20bn during the 11-month period. This comprised $3bn each in rollovers from Saudi Arabia and China, and $2bn from the UAE. Pakistan’s total annual rollover portfolio from these three countries stands at approximately $12.7bn in the form of safe deposits and loans, leaving net international reserves (NIR) at around $3bn.
 
 

The EAD noted that inflows of foreign economic assistance dropped by 8.7pc to $6.89bn, largely due to delays in the IMF programme, which caused many commercial lenders to remain cautious. In comparison, inflows during the same period last year totalled about $9bn, including IMF funds.
In May alone, the EAD reported inflows of $797m, up from $576m in April, $555m in March, $237m in February, and $830m in January.
Of the $6.89bn received, around $3.9bn was allocated for budgetary support or programme loans, while $2.98bn was directed toward project financing. During the same period last year, project aid stood at $2.56bn and programme loans at $4.99bn.
Multilateral lenders contributed $3.37bn in the first 11 months of 2024-25, compared to $3.14bn last year. Bilateral disbursements declined sharply to $487m, down 45pc from $889m in the same period last year.
The EAD reported receiving approximately $903m from foreign commercial lenders based in the UAE, indicating a slight rebound from last year when commercial financing had nearly dried up. However, this is well short of the $3.8bn target set for the year, reflecting the continued impact of the delayed IMF programme, challenging economic conditions, and associated credit rating concerns.
The government had also aimed to raise $1bn through international bonds and projected $9bn in inflows from China and Saudi Arabia, including a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn in SAFE deposits from China. These funds are vital to bridging Pakistan’s external financing gap under the IMF programme.
In addition, Pakistan received $1.77bn from overseas Pakistanis via Naya Pakistan Certificates, up from $1.05bn in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.39bn during the period, up from $766m a year earlier, while the World Bank contributed $1.23bn.

The announcement came after the inaugural meeting of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan Vice Foreign Minister/Foreign Secretary mechanism on Friday.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said the meeting was attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, Bangladesh’s acting Foreign Secretary Ruhul Alam Siddique and Pakistan’s Additional Foreign Secretary Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
 






Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch joined the initial session via video link.

New trilateral forum looks to enhance engagement, work for more trade, investment

In her remarks, Ms Baloch expressed Pakistan’s desire for a deeper engagement between China and South Asian countries.
She highlighted the “upward trajectory of bilateral ties” with both China and Bangladesh and “conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to work with the two nations to enhance ties in trade and investment, agriculture, digital economy, environment protection, marine sciences, green infrastructure, culture, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The three nations agreed to establish a joint working group to oversee the implementation of the agreements reached during the talks.
The launch of this trilateral platform marks a notable development in the South Asian geopolitical landscape, particularly as it brought together Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had remained diplomatically distant for decades.
The relations between Islamabad and Dhaka have warmed considerably since the ouster of former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina last year.
Under the interim leadership of Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Dhaka has actively pursued broader diplomatic horizons, including a new phase of engagement with both China and Pakistan.
China, for its part, has sought to deepen its influence in South Asia through economic diplomacy and regional connectivity initiatives.
Mr Yunus’s state visit to Beijing in March and Bangladesh’s invitation to China to invest in sensitive infrastructure projects such as the Teesta River and Mongla Port suggest a policy shift away from Ms Hasina’s India-leaning approach.
 
 

Meanwhile, Pakistan and Bangladesh have resumed direct trade, military exchanges, and high-level diplomatic dialogue after more than a decade of minimal contact.
For Beijing, the growing trilateral ties advance its long-term regional objectives that relate to building alternate economic corridors, expanding its presence in the Bay of Bengal, and diminishing India’s strategic space in the neighbourhood.
For India, the formation of a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh alignment could pose significant diplomatic and security concerns, particularly as some of the proposed Chinese-supported infrastructure projects lie close to India’s sensitive northeastern corridor.
While the trilateral mechanism remains in its formative stages, the institutionalisation of these ties signals a deliberate attempt by the three countries to explore long-term cooperation beyond bilateral engagements.
 
 

The grouping could evolve into a new regional bloc with implications for South Asian geopolitics, especially if the partnership expands to include broader connectivity, defence dialogues, and coordinated positions at international forums.
No specific timeline was announced for the next round of meetings, but the establishment of a joint working group is expected to accelerate follow-up discussions and cooperation across multiple sectors.

• PPP lawmaker calls for creation of South Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: Like every year, the National Assembly on Friday once again echoed with the familiar demand for creating new provinces in the country during the general debate on the federal budget.
Taking part in the debate on the budget for the next fiscal year, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf forcefully demanded carving out Hazara province in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whereas PPP’s Syed Murtaza Mahmud called for bifurcating Punjab to create South Punjab province.
“I demand that wherever it is administratively viable, new provinces should be created in the country. Hazara province as well as other provinces should be made to resolve the public issues and to meet people’s needs,” declared the minister who belongs to the ruling PML-N.
He accused the provincial PTI government of neglecting Hazara region in general and Mansehra in particular, alleging that the people of the area were being deprived of their fundamental rights. He said Mansehra had a population of more than 300,000 people who do not even have access to clean drinking water.
“The PTI’s provincial government is least interested in provision of basic facilities to the people of Mansehra,” he went on saying, while stressing the need for creating Hazara provinces.
Drawing attention of the house towards the ongoing movement for the Hazara province in KP, he said the only solution to the country’s problems was the creation of new provinces.
He further said the main purpose of the parliament was to discuss the problems of the people and suggest their solutions.
Similarly, participating in the budget debate, PPP MNA from Rahim Yar Khan Murtaza Mahmud urged all the political parties to sit together to discuss formation of South Punjab province in order to remove the sense of deprivation among the people of the region.
 
 

Mr Mehmud said that presently Punjab comprised 60 per cent of Pakistan because of which “anti-Punjab slogan has become popular in smaller provinces”. He was of the view that South Punjab province was necessary for Pakistan.
On June 17, PPP’s Abdul Qadir Gilani had also decried the Punjab government’s discriminatory policy towards south Punjab, stating that sense of deprivation was increasing among the people in the region.
He had regretted that only three development schemes had been announced for the region whereas some 40 plans had been announced for Lahore and central Punjab.
“I don’t know when will we get rid of Takht-i-Lahore [Lahore Kingdom]? But we will continue our struggle,” said Mr Gilani, who is the son of Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, in an apparent reference to the demand for a separate South Punjab province.
He praised the previous PTI government for setting up South Punjab Secretariat in Bahawalpur, urging the government to make it functional.
Meanwhile, taking part in the budget debate, PTI’s Junaid Akbar Chaudhry, who is also the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), criticised the government’s economic policies.
In an apparent reference to the party’s stance that the previous elections were heavily rigged, the PTI leader said the treasury benchers knew that those who counted votes were more important than those who polled the votes, adding that “they also know that those who have brought them into power, can bring them into power again.”
Mr Chaudhry claimed that the courts had become redundant as they had been unable to deliver justice after the 26th Constitutional Amendment and went on suggesting conversion of courts’ buildings into universities.
Arrest powers
Earlier in the day, Minister of State for Finance and head of the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit Bilal Azhar Kayani addressed the National Assembly, in which he responded to the criticism on the government’s move to empower tax officials to make arrests at the inquiry stage in sales tax cases.
The minister said that for the first time in the parliamentary history, the budget had been minutely discussed in the NA Standing Committee on Finance. He said the finance minister and the officials of the ministry regularly attended meetings of the committees of both the houses of the parliament.
Mr Kayani claimed that economic stability had been achieved while fulfilling IMF conditions and simultaneously providing public relief. He said the National Tariff Policy would be a cornerstone of PM Shehbaz Sharif’s vision to boost exports and drive economic growth.
He expressed the hope that the current IMF programme would be Pakistan’s last one, once the economy achieved sustainable growth and became self-reliant through dollar-earning exports.
The National Assembly will now meet on Monday morning.

• Bench ‘realised pressure endured by PTI members’, rectified situation, argues Salman Akram Raja
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s order in the reserved seats case amended the Constitution as it altered the constitutional deadline of three days for independent lawmakers to join a political party, Justice Musarrat Hilali has remarked.
The court’s order on July 12, 2024 — more than five months after the general elections on Feb 8 — allowed 41 PTI-backed independent lawmakers to confirm their political affiliation in 15 days.
Justice Hilali made these remarks on Friday while hearing appeals filed against last year’s order.
She also asked Salman Akram Raja, who was representing PTI lawmaker Kanwal Shauzab, to comment on this constitutional amendment.
Mr Raja disapproved of the impression, saying the situation under which PTI contested last year’s elections was “something where the party had to swim through a river of fire and blood”.
The counsel explained the July 12 verdict did not extend the time period to 15 days from the statutory three days. Rather, it stated that these 41 out of 80 candidates should be considered to have been backed by PTI from the very beginning.
The verdict realised the “pressures endured by PTI members” and the court decided the only way to rectify the situation was to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 66 of the Elections Rules, the counsel explained.
Through the judgement, 41 members were asked to notify through affidavits to which party they belonged within 15 days. However, the candidates were never asked to join PTI, the counsel argued.
The entire electoral process, Mr Raja emphasised, was a fundamental right exercised through articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, another bench member, asked Mr Raja whether PTI was claiming entitlement to reserved seats in parliament.
 
 

“Do you think it is the right of any political party to claim reserved seats?” asked Justice Najafi.
The counsel retorted it was the right of the people to ensure that reserved seats were allocated as per the proportionate representation system.
The Constitution mandated parliament to be filled with representatives chosen by the people of Pakistan, the counsel contended.
“If elections were not fair, then why has the Supreme Court not struck them down?” questioned Justice Najafi.
The counsel said it could have been done so but the Supreme Court exercised restraint.
On constitutional deviations, Mr Raja said, it was for the first time in history a — major — political party was de-legitimised by not allowing it to contest the election.
Therefore, the majority of judges in the July 12 judgment recognised that constitutional deviation was committed on account of effective de-recognition of PTI as a political party, which resulted in certain consequences.
Mr Raja defended PTI members, saying that to blame them for committing mistakes by identifying themselves as independent candidates and then deliberately joining the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) gives and impression that everything else was alright.
 
 

He added that 11 out of 13 judges on the bench that heard the case last year “ignored fictitious facts” produced before the court that PTI committed errors by joining SIC and contesting elections as independents.
All but two judges embraced the reality that PTI as a party contested and in fact won seats during the general election and therefore was entitled to reserved seats of women and non Muslims, the counsel emphasised.
When asked by Justice Jamal Mandokhail whether the Election Commission’s decision to allocate reser­ved seats to the Baloch­is­tan Awami Party after the 2018 general elections was right or wrong, Mr Raja replied that in his view, the decision could not be called “wrong”.
The members who contested the election as independents should not be forced to join a party that they did not intend to join before the election, said Mr Raja.
