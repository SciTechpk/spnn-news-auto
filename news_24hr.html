The disaster could now trigger one of the country’s largest internal migrations since the devastating 2010 floods, aid agencies and local experts warn.
“Migration has already started in several areas as unprecedented rains and floods have left nothing behind for millions of people,” Shaukat Ali Chadhar, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Agriculture, told Anadolu.
Chadhar said the ongoing deluges have already affected around 10m people dependent on agriculture across the country, mainly in Punjab.
“A multi-pronged combination of rains and floods has affected the farmers in many ways, destroying stored and standing crops, agricultural lands and livestock,” he explained, saying it could take up to 18 months for the land to become cultivable again.
“This gloomy scenario has left no choice for them but to migrate to the big cities to make a living,” Chadhar said, warning that as many as one million migrants could make the move.
Climate disaster compounded by human factors
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned last Friday that Pakistan was facing one of its worst monsoon seasons in recent memory.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 922 people have been killed and 1,047 injured since late June, while more than 10,000 homes have been partially or completely destroyed, mainly in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In late August, India — also battered by heavy rains — opened the gates of major dams on rivers shared under the Indus Waters Treaty, cautioning Pakistan that the releases could swell downstream floods. The added discharges pushed Punjab’s water levels even higher.
For the first time in the country’s 78-year history, three eastern rivers — the Sutlej, Jhelum and Chenab — are simultaneously at “exceptionally” high flood levels, according to local authorities.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, sudden glacial lake outburst floods added another layer of devastation, tearing through remote valleys and destroying homes, water systems and power lines. These floods occur when rains or rising temperatures cause mountain lakes to burst, releasing torrents of water and debris with little warning.
The UN says climate change is accelerating glacial melt across the Himalaya and Hindu Kush ranges, creating more unstable lakes and heightening the risk of such disasters.
“Unpredictable and intense weather patterns, shrinking agriculture, sea erosion, unemployment, and lingering dry spells have caused widespread migration within Pakistan in the past decade,” Hafiz Wasi Mohammad Khan, a member of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board, told Anadolu.
“We fear that this process would be further accelerated by the latest floods.”
He estimated that although temporary migration will be higher, around 25 per cent of the displaced people may never be able to return to their homes.
Earlier this year, the Climate Risk Index ranked Pakistan as the country most affected by climate change in 2022.
Experts also point to human-driven vulnerabilities such as unchecked land grabs and illegal constructions along natural drainage paths, which the government has vowed to address.
“Pakistan stands where it was in 2010 in terms of handling floods,” Khan said. “I suspect we will be discussing the same situation next year.”
Government planning ‘massive rehabilitation package’
In 2010, more than 2m people were displaced by floods that inundated one-fifth of the country. Of those, 70pc permanently settled in big cities because of the destruction of their homes and farmlands, according to the climate change ministry.
Khan warned that another wave of mass migration to already-overcrowded cities would not only add to their strained infrastructure but also fuel crime and deepen poverty.
“An enormous challenge is ahead in terms of rehabilitation and food security. The affected families have lost everything — their homes, lands, livestock and piled up stocks,” he said, adding that farmers urgently need cash inputs to procure seeds and other agricultural supplies.
He noted that many communities, especially downstream, have learned from recurring floods over the past two decades. In some cases, they even view them as opportunities, as floods can regenerate land and replenish underground water levels.
Chadhar called for the establishment of a “special agriculture fund” to help farmers, in addition to writing off their loans and utility bills, saying the government cannot handle the challenge of rehabilitation alone.
Meanwhile, Farid Abdulkadir Aiywar, IFRC head of delegation for Pakistan, urged the international community not to overlook the unfolding tragedy that is “quietly but relentlessly” devastating communities across the country.
“The crisis is far from over,” he told reporters on Friday. “Entire communities remain underwater, families have lost everything, and access to safe water and health care is becoming more urgent by the day.”
Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, however, downplayed the chances of a large migration toward urban centres.
“This time, there will be no mass migration by [flood-affected people] as the government is set to announce a massive rehabilitation package for them, which will cover everything — from their crops and land losses to home destruction,” Kathia told Anadolu.</p><small>2025-09-08 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08230118eabd783.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940536/pindi-police-book-aleema-khan-naeem-panjutha-others-for-violence-against-journalist-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police book Aleema Khan, Naeem Panjutha, others for violence against journalist outside Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Police on Monday booked PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and others for violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
A first information report (FIR) was filed at the Saddar Bairooni Police Station today on the complaint of Supreme Court Press Association President Tayyab Baloch under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 382 (theft after preparation made causing death, hurt or restraint in order to committing of the theft), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Baloch said that he was present outside Adiala Jail at around 3:55pm for reporting with other journalists when Aleema and other people began a media talk after a hearing for the Toshakhana case.
“During this time, a person named Naeem Panjutha called out: ‘Teach him a lesson for questioning Aleema about properties,’” Baloch said, adding that 35-40 people there grabbed him at that, laid him down and began beating him.
“During this time, some unknown person snatched my mobile phone from me and also broke my microphone,” he said, adding that other reporters there who tried to rescue him were also beaten up.
“We barely escaped them after much pleading. The reason is that I had previously asked Aleema Khan about purchasing properties in America as a journalist, which made her uncomfortable. On which, Aleema Khan, through his workers, first posted pictures of me … [and others] on social media and spread rumours against us. Today, as per the pre-arranged plan, they attacked me, beat me up, forcibly snatched my mobile and threatened to kill me, along with breaking my microphone.”
He requested legal proceedings against Aleema, Panjutha and the other suspects.
In reponse, Panjutha termed the FIR a “fake case” against him and Aleema.
 






Slamming the incident, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Baloch was targeted with violence “solely and only because of a difference of opinion, which is unacceptable”.
He said strict action would be taken and vowed to give his full support.
 






PPP leaders such as Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also condemned the incident.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili said the incident was both “unfortunate and condemnable”. He added that “this new trend will not end unless political parties actively discourage it. We must remember that politics and journalism rise & fall together.”

Jean Carroll, whom he was found to have sexually assaulted.
The January 2024 order consisted of $65m in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3m in compensatory damages and $11m to pay for an online campaign to repair Carroll’s reputation.
The civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeded the more than $10m in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.
Trump — whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York — used his Truth Social platform at the time to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial and the judge, whom he called “an extremely abusive individual”.
‘Substantial financial penalty’
“We hold that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury’s duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,” the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote.
Carroll, 81, alleged that Trump defamed her in 2019, when she first made her assault allegations public, by saying she “is not my type”.
Jurors were shown Trump’s October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his “type”.
In 2023, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a “complete con job”.
“We agree with the district court that the jury was entitled to find that Trump would not stop defaming Carroll unless he was subjected to a substantial financial penalty,” the appeals court ruled today.
Trump was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he used the case to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimised as he campaigned for a return to the White House.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622665-kp-it-board-fails-to-achieve-targets-reveals-audit-report' target='_blank'><strong>KPITB fails to achieve targets, reveals audit report</strong></a><br><p>

They dubbed the full court meeting, which was called for this purpose today, a mere “stamp of approval” for the rules, which they said were already decided and unilaterally approved.
The letter addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was sent by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Athar Minallah. The four judges also skipped the full court meeting held later today.
They pointed out that “if the full court was not deemed necessary for the adoption of the rules themselves, how can it now be summoned to deliberate upon their amendment?”
The judges said the working paper for the meeting’s agenda stated that under Rule 1(4) of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, the CJP may “remove any difficulty in giving effect to the said rules” on the recommendations of a committee that was constituted by him and had already been formed.
Moreover, “the chief justice, through a letter dated August 12, 2025, informed the judges that the rules had already been approved through circulation and duly notified in the Gazette on August 9, 2025,” the judges highlighted.
Yet, they further stated, the CJP had sought suggestions “for further amendments” to the rules.
Calling into question the legality of the rules themselves, the judges noted that the “present Supreme Court rules were never placed before, nor approved by, the full court.”
Citing Article 191 of the Constitution, they said the SC had the “power to make rules regulating its practice and procedure, but this power is exercised collectively by the court as an institution”.
The judges concluded that any rules established “without deliberation and approval of the full court” lacked its approval and could not acquire “binding legal status”.
They were of the opinion that the rules, in their present form, “suffer from both substantive and procedural illegality”. In this connection, they expressed reservations that rules were processed through circulation.
“Circulation is an administrative convenience to deal with routine or minor procedural matters; it is not, and cannot be, the vehicle for laying down the constitutional architecture of this court’s governance.
“Unless the full court had itself had expressly resolved to adopt circulation for this purpose, the chief justice alone could not unilaterally resort to it.”
Further highlighting confusion around the matter, the judges said that the working paper for the meeting invoked “Rule 1(R) regarding removal of difficulties” during the process, despite there being no need to invoke the provision.
The judges deliberated that the provision was invoked only “to defend or justify the unilateral process already undertaken”.
“Instead of clarifying the legitimacy of the rules, this only exposes their infirmity: if no difficulty exists, why place such a point before the full court?” they asked.
The four SC judges termed the purpose behind the move “puzzling and fallacious”. The judges, in their letter, questioned why a full court was convened if the rules had already been notified as “approved” on August 9.
Within three days, on August 12, CJP “sought suggestions for amendment [to] the same rules”, the judges said.
They went on to add that “this sequence tacitly acknowledges that the full court is the correct forum for such deliberation,” but noted that it was only undertaken after the “fait accompli of unilateral approval”.
“This amounts to putting the cart before the horse-first declaring the Rules valid, and then calling the full court merely to consider patchwork amendments,” they added.
On that note, the judges regretted that the “meeting is being used to give a veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process,” and aimed to reduce the role of a full court to only “cosmetic”.
The forum was being used to ratify “what has already been done rather than discharging its true constitutional function under Article 191,” the judges claimed.
The judges recommended that the constitutional course of action would have been to “place the rules in their entirety, before the full court, permit genuine discussion and deliberation, and only thereafter seek formal approval.”
Calling for the abandonment of the meeting, the judges said that it was “designed to merely serve as a stamp of approval” and to proceed with it would be equal to reducing the “full court to an afterthought — convened not for decision-making but for damage control.”
The judges noted that such a move “undermines the collective authority of this court”.
Citing the above reservations, the four judges refused to attend the full court, unless a constitutional course of action is adopted, stating that, “we see no point in attending a meeting that is premised on amending rules which, in our respectful view, already suffer from illegality both in substance and in process.”
The letter further called for the objection to be presented in the minutes of the full court meeting and for the meeting to be made public.
“People are entitled to know how rules governing the internal life of the court came to be notified without discussion or deliberation amongst its judges,” the letter added, calling the meeting a ploy to “cloak” the whole process in a “semblance of legitimacy”.
“By opening our deliberations to the gaze of the people we serve, we reinforce the trust without which no constitutional court can function,” the letter concluded.
Last week, Justice Shah, in a separate letter to the CJP, had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was “approved by circulation”, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
In March, a committee constituted by CJP Afridi was tasked to conduct a thorough review of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980, and formulated a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The aim was to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings.
However, when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while the legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
Full court meeting
Later in the day, the full court meeting was held without the participation of the four judges.
A press release from the Supreme Court said CJP Afridi welcomed the participants and commended the efforts of the committee constituted to review the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. He appreciated the committee’s “exhaustive work”, undertaken with input from fellow judges and the legal fraternity, resulting in a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The chief justice briefed the full court on the rules, the press release said, adding that after detailed deliberations on various provisions, the meeting’s participants unanimously agreed that the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, were a “living document” and should be subject to ongoing review and amendment as required from time to time.
“The full court, after considering various aspects and deliberating upon some of the critical provisions, unanimously decided to postpone the implementation of amendments to the extent of enhancement of court fees and securities for the time being. The committee shall consider the suggestions from honourable judges, the bar representatives or other stakeholders in this regard for placement before the full court for decision in light of the committee’s recommendations.
“The honourable chief justice termed this development a significant milestone, reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to strengthening institutional frameworks and ensuring that the Supreme Court Rules remain dynamic, responsive and in line with contemporary needs,” the press release said.

The city is bracing for heavy rainfall over the coming days as strong monsoon currents penetrate Sindh as the PMD had said a day ago that a deep depression was expected to enter the southeastern parts of the province from India today.
While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD had highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
According to rainfall figures from the PMD as of 5pm today, University Road received the most rain with 8.8 millimetres, followed by Gulshan-i-Maymar (8mm), Gulshan-i-Hadeed (7mm), Airport Old Area (6.6mm), Saadi Town (4.3mm), Korangi (4mm), PAF Faisal Base 3mm), Jinnah Terminal (2.8mm), Nazimabad (1.5mm), North Karachi (1.2mm) and Keamari (1mm).
In a message on X at 4:12pm, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said it had begun to rain again and urged people to avoid unnecessary movement.
 






He also held a meeting with senior Karachi officials regarding rain preparations, saying they agreed on alternate routes and traffic diversions in case of any eventuality.
 






The Provincial Disaster Management Authority was directed to remain in the field with dewatering machines, pumps, and other necessary equipment to ensure the timely drainage of rainwater.
The PDMA director general informed the meeting’s members that 16 dewatering pumps were already installed at various choke points across the city.
He also said that rescue kits would be provided to field officers to enable immediate assistance to citizens and Rescue 1122 teams were put on high alert to respond promptly in case of emergencies and to carry out rescue operations with machinery to be deployed at key points, while the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation would establish special camps to provide guidance and support to citizens.
Wahab was told that the cleaning of storm drains and choke points was expedited and union council chairmen were directed to ensure drainage of rainwater from inner streets during the rain spell.
The members also decided that control rooms would be established at the Commissioner’s Office and Police Office to ensure close coordination among all institutions.
K-Electric officials assured the meeting’s members that special control points were already set up to ensure an uninterrupted power supply during the rains.
Sindh Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah stressed that all institutions must work in close coordination with a joint strategy to ensure smooth traffic management, effective drainage, and maximum facilitation for the people of Karachi during the upcoming rains.
On the order of the Sindh CM, the chief secretary conducted a review of the city’s preparedness for ongoing and expected rainfall.
According to a spokesperson, all deputy commissioners are on high alert along with their teams to manage any emergency situation.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi has issued instructions to ensure smooth traffic flow throughout the city, while the DIG Traffic made a tour of various areas to oversee and implement traffic control measures.
“The district administration and municipal bodies are actively working to provide maximum public convenience,” the commissioner said.
A control room has been established at the Commissioner’s Office to continuously monitor the situation in the city and coordinate a timely response where needed.
The Karachi Traffic Police have issued an advisory urging residents to avoid low-lying areas and use designated alternate routes to stay safe.
In District Central, key roads like Powerhouse Chowrangi to Nagan Chowrangi are prone to waterlogging, the advisory read.
Commuters were advised to use diversions via Shafiq Mor, Godhra, and New Karachi. Those heading to North Nazimabad Blocks N, H, I can take routes through Imtiaz Store, Mujahid Colony, and Peoples Chowrangi.
“On Sharea Faisal and in District East, areas such as Nursery, Baloch Colony, Karsaz, and Drigh Road Underpass are expected to be heavily affected,” the advisory read.
Travellers going to and from Jinnah International Airport were asked to use alternative routes via Tariq Road, Stadium Road, Johar Chowrangi, and Shahrah-e-Bhutto.
 






Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08180943e1337ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940515/us-metals-company-signs-500m-mou-with-pakistan-on-critical-minerals' target='_blank'><strong>US metals company signs $500m MoU with Pakistan on critical minerals</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth $500 million with an American metals company, the US Strategic Metals (USSM), it emerged on Monday.
The USSM, based in the state of Missouri, is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the United States Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
The USSM is a company that specialises in extracting critical metals from old lithium-ion batteries and mining cobalt, nickel and copper, according to its website. According to the American embassy, the US Department of Energy has defined critical minerals as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
A press release from the US Embassy, published on Sunday, stated that Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Zach Harkenrider accompanied a USSM-led delegation to sign an MoU with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) at the Prime Minister’s House.
Speaking about the MoU signing, US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said, “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”
 






Speaking about the importance of such bilateral agreements, Baker said that US President Donald Trump’s administration has made forging such deals a key priority, based on the importance of critical mineral resources to American security and prosperity.
“We look forward to seeing future agreements between US companies and their counterparts in the critical minerals and mining sector in Pakistan.”
A statement from the PM House said that the USSM delegation is visiting  Pakistan to explore opportunities for expanding the country’s mining operations and assessing the potential for value addition in mineral resources and the development of supporting infrastructure.
“[The] delegation held high-level meetings with [the] prime minister of Pakistan, chief of army staff, minister of petroleum and minister of commerce and were briefed on Pakistan’s vast mineral reserves, including copper, gold, and rare earth elements,” the statement read.
“In this context, two Memoranda of Understanding, focusing on [the] development and processing of critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs), and logistics services, were signed.”
The second MoU was signed between the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a global leader in engineering and construction.
“The current survey of opportunities in Pakistan aims to identify priority markets where Mota-Engil can align with government visions and private sector initiatives. The group seeks to build long-term partnerships that leverage its global know-how while creating value locally through job creation, technology transfer, and sustainable development.”
According to the statement, the partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten and REEs.
“The first phase of this deal is envisaged at approximately $500m of investments into Pakistans critical minerals sector,” the statement read.
 






Pakistan’s relations with the US have been improving, with both nations recently signing trade deals. Islamabad successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a deal with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
In April this year, a senior US official had underscored Washington’s strategic interest in Pakistan’s mineral sector, signalling a push for long-term cooperation in the development of critical mineral resources key to American advanced technologies.
“Critical minerals are the raw materials necessary for our most advanced technologies,” Eric Meyer, senior bureau official for the Department of State’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, was quoted in a statement issued by the US embassy in Islamabad on his visit.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622643-four-sc-judges-boycott-cosmetic-full-court-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Four SC judges boycott 'cosmetic' full court meeting</strong></a><br><p>

Some of the mainly youth protesters forced their way into the parliament complex in Kathmandu by breaking through a barricade, a local official said, setting fire to an ambulance and hurling objects at lines of riot police guarding the legislature.
“The police have been firing indiscriminately,” one protester told the ANI news agency.
“[They] fired bullets which missed me but hit a friend who was standing behind me. He was hit in the hand.”
More than 100 people, including 28 police personnel, were receiving medical treatment for their injuries, police officer Shekhar Khanal told Reuters. Protesters were ferrying the injured to the hospital on motorcycles.
Another two people were killed when protests in the eastern city of Itahari turned violent, police said.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the unrest, which erupted after thousands of young people, including many wearing their school or college uniforms, took to the streets earlier today.
Many carried flags and placards with slogans such as “Shut down corruption and not social media”, “Unban social media” and “Youths against corruption”, as they marched through Kathmandu.
Organisers of the protests, which spread to other cities in the Himalayan country, have called them “demonstrations by Gen Z”. They say the protests reflect young people’s widespread frustration with government action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.
“This is the protest by the new generation in Nepal,” another protester told ANI.
A government decision to block access to several social media platforms, including Facebook, last week has fuelled anger among the young. About 90 per cent of Nepal’s 30 million people use the internet.
Officials said they imposed the ban because platforms had failed to register with authorities in a crackdown on misuse, including false social media accounts used to spread hate speech and fake news, and commit fraud.
Batons and rubber bullets
Police had orders to use water cannons, batons and rubber bullets to control the crowd and the army was deployed in the parliament area to bolster law enforcement officers, Muktiram Rijal, a spokesperson for the Kathmandu district office, told Reuters.
He said the curfew, which will remain in force until 10pm local time (1615 GMT), had been extended to Kathmandu’s Singha Durbar area, which includes the prime minister’s office and other government buildings.
Violence abated later in the evening, although protesters remained in the area outside parliament.
Police said similar protests were also held in Biratnagar and Bharatpur in the southern plains and in Pokhara in western Nepal.
Many people in Nepal think corruption is rampant, and the Oli government has been criticised by opponents for failing to deliver on its promises to tackle graft or make progress to address longstanding economic issues.
Thousands of young Nepalis go abroad every year for work and education.
Rameshwore Khanal, a former finance secretary, said that although job creation is not up to expectations, popular anger appears to stem more from unhappiness with government appointments and its inability to stamp out corruption.
Nepal’s social media shutdown comes as governments worldwide take steps to tighten oversight of social media and big tech due to growing concern about issues such as misinformation, data privacy, online harm and national security.
Critics say many of these measures risk stifling free expression, but regulators say stricter controls are needed to protect users and preserve social order.</p><small>2025-09-08 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081915251d306c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940520/sri-lanka-to-play-bilateral-odi-series-in-pakistan-after-six-years-pcb' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka to play bilateral ODI series in Pakistan after six years: PCB</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to host Sri Lanka for a series of one day international (ODI) matches in Rawalpindi from Novermber 11-15, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday.
A day earlier, the PCB announced that it was set to host Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for a T20 International (T20I) tri-series for the first time from November 17 to 29 in Lahore and Rawalpindi.
In a press release, the PCB noted that this would be Sri Lanka’s first bilateral ODI series in Pakistan since 2019, when they last visited for a three-match series that the Green Shirts won 2-0, with the first ODI in Karachi abandoned due to rain.
“Sri Lanka’s most recent visit to Pakistan came in 2023, when they participated in the ACC Asia Cup and played against Afghanistan in Lahore,” the press release read.
 






The PCB reiterated that the nation’s maiden tri-series will be held after the ODI matches, while the Green Shirts will host two ICC World Test Championship matches and six white-ball games against South Africa from October 12 to November 8.
International cricket had dried up in Pakistan following a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Consequently, the Green Shirts were forced to play international matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
In 2017, international cricket began gradually returning to Pakistan with the Green Shirts playing against the ICC World XI in a series of three T20 internationals.
Earlier this year, the country hosted the ICC Champions Trophy in February and March, though India played their matches in Dubai. It was the first time that Pakistan hosted an ICC event after 1996.</p><small>2025-09-08 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622633-kazakh-dpm-nurtleu-arrives-in-pakistan-to-cement-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh DPM Nurtleu arrives in Pakistan to 'cement bilateral ties'</strong></a><br><p>

He was addressing a judicial conference at the apex court, marking the commencement of the new judicial year.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
 
 

“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he said.
The chief justice emphasised, “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”
Justices Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Malik Shahzad Ahmad were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.

Judges’ leave
During his speech, CJP Afridi also detailed a number of new policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced to address the structure of discussions on important issues.
Justice Afridi remarked that the chief justice could previously take up any case out of order for an early hearing, but SOPs were now in place to prevent that.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.
Then, apparently responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Shah’s recent letter on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said leaves outside of judicial holidays required permission.
“Let’s look at the grant of leave. I made it very clear, during holidays anyone who wants to go anywhere, no issue. But when there is court work, then I said here is the discretion, discretion is the exercise, it is the criteria, you have got everything in writing.”
 
 

Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, empowering the CJP to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
In his letter, Justice Shah wrote: “In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it.
“Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums.”
Enforced disappearances’ issue given ‘serious attention’
CJP Afridi further observed that the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee, which he heads and includes all the chief justices, had given “serious attention” to the issue of enforced disappearances.
“We sat down and decided on 17 items on which we are to proceed […]
First and foremost was that serious attention was given to enforced disappearances,” the top judge said.
He thanked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan for assuring the judiciary that the government was “seriously considering a mechanism to ensure the production of detained persons”.
 
 

“I thank you for that and I expect that soon, we will have a good news regarding that,” Justice Afridi remarked.
“Number two, to safeguard the dignity of judges, SOPs have also been framed by the high courts to protect the judicial officers from external influence. This is the district judiciary. We have done it; all the district judiciary, all the high courts have framed their rules,” the CJP stated.
SC reforms based on 5 principles
Justice Afridi observed that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
The CJP listed those principles: “To improve service delivery through technology, to improve access and transparency, to strengthen legal and regulatory framework, leverage international and external resources, and to revitalise the attached departments.”
 


Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice. He said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised during six interactive meetings held to discuss the SC’s reforms.
“There are two groups in the lawyers’ community,” the CJP remarked, adding that members from both were included in the consultation process for judicial reforms.
He detailed that a high-powered committee led by Justice Shahid Waheed, which also included Justices Irfan Saadat Khan, Afghan and Abbasi, reviewed suggestions made by the SC “sections”, some judges and lawyers. Those were then placed before an administrative full court meeting on April 17.
Justice Afridi also spoke of the “Public Facilitation Centre” inaugurated today, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases.
Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge urged those having objections to file their recommendations, which would then be taken up by a committee and eventually the full court. “I assure you that whatever your proposals are will be […] taken into consideration,” he affirmed.
‘Reduced security protocols for judges’
During his address, CJP Afridi highlighted that the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols when in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I had nine security contingents as the chief justice. I sat down with the security people and I said ‘I am in the Red Zone, my residence is in the Red Zone, please have a heart’. So we have come down to this that there will only be two security vehicles with me, and same is the case with the worthy judges.”
 
 

He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
AGP Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta also addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”
The CJP’s address today came ahead of a full court meeting later today — in which all SC judges are expected to participate — to review and approve the Supreme Court Rules 2025, as cracks in the judiciary become starker.
In his recent letter to the CJP, senior puisne judge Justice Shah asked him to answer six questions he raised about judicial independence, the court’s rules and policies, and the appeals against the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-09-08 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0817002478f38bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940501/quetta-police-arrest-over-100-protesters-for-violating-section-144-shutting-shops-and-highways' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta police arrest ‘over 100’ protesters for violating Section 144, shutting shops and highways</strong></a><br><p>The Quetta police arrested more than 100 protesters for violating a ban on gatherings, allegedly forcefully shutting down markets and blocking highways, an officer said on Monday.
“More than 100 people were arrested under charges of violating Section 144, forcefully shutting down markets and blocking highways,” Quetta Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Baloch told Dawn.com.
The arrests come as six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan today to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Sept 2 and claimed 15 lives.
Police in Quetta fired tear gas to disperse protesters and arrested them, AFP reported. AFP pictures showed people blocking roads by placing stones, which they were also pelting, and burning objects.
At 12pm, the National Highways and Motorways Police said the N-25 highway near Baleli Custom in Quetta was closed due to a “public protest”.
 






Parts of the N-25 highway, which extends from Karachi to Quetta, were also blocked near Hub and Mastung’s Sona Khan area, the motorway police said in the morning.
 






 






The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance — which the PTI, PkMAP and BNP-M are a part of — shared purported pictures on its X account of closed shops in Awaran.
 






In another post, it claimed that the Western Bypass in Quetta was “completely shut”. “Violence and shelling by the police on PTI workers. The workers are continuing to resist the police shelling,” it added.
 






The opposition parties had declared that highways, intercity roads and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked during the strike. Other airports in the province would also be shut, they added, urging the business community and transporters to support the strike.
The Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, had announced the closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing. The Private Schools Association also declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.
 
 

Last night, the Balochistan government warned protesters of “strict and immediate action” if they tried to disrupt law and order, or block roads and highways.
Fifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and BNP founder.
Subsequently, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Mah­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of the PTI, Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), had announced the strike at a joint press conference.
Mengal, calling the stadium bombing a “painful and tragic act”, had criticised the state for not fulfilling its “duty” to protect the gathering. Mengal, Achakzai, former NP senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai had remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.</p><small>2025-09-08 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622604-scuffle-erupts-during-aleema-khans-media-talk-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Scuffle erupts during Aleema Khan's media talk outside Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>

A press release from the President’s Secretariat quoted Zardari as saying that the award was “in recognition of his outstanding services and contributions”.
“He (President Zardari) added that the commander’s visit reflected the enduring fraternal ties between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, which stand as a testament to the two countries’ shared commitment to deepening cooperation in all fields,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the president appreciated the confidence the UAE’s Navy placed in the professional expertise of the Pakistan Navy and expressed interest in further collaboration, stating that they remain ready to support their Emirati counterpart’s manpower requirements in the future.
President Zardari also highlighted the extraordinary and exemplary relations that Pakistan and the UAE enjoy, which are “rooted in history and strengthened by enduring people-to-people bonds”. The press release said that he reaffirmed Islamabad’s resolve to continue working closely with the UAE and bolster brotherly ties.
“Commander Alremeithi informed the president that he had close ties with Pakistan, having spent four years in the country while graduating from the Pakistan Naval Academy [in] Karachi,” the press release stated.
During his visit, Maj Gen Alremeithi also called on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where he was welcomed with a guard of honour, according to a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
 


“The two dignitaries held in-depth discussions on professional matters, reviewing the evolving global and regional geo-strategic environment,” the ISPR said. “Both sides emphasised the vital role of bilateral defence and security cooperation, including in the maritime domain, for regional peace and stability.”
The ISPR stated that Maj Gen Alremeithi expressed appreciation for the professional standards and achievements of the Pakistan Armed Forces, as well as their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and continued efforts towards achieving regional peace and stability.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-09-08 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08134208c68389b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940481/6-killed-several-others-injured-in-jerusalem-shooting-attack-israeli-foreign-minister' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed, several others injured in Jerusalem shooting attack: Israeli foreign minister</strong></a><br><p>Monday’s bus stop shooting in Jerusalem killed six people and injured several others, including a pregnant woman, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said at a press conference during a visit to Budapest.
Earlier, emergency service and medical teams “pronounced the deaths of four victims, including a man about 50 years old and three men aged around 30”, a statement from Magen David Adom — Israel’s emergency service — said, adding it was providing medical treatment to several other people, with five evacuated to hospitals.
The service received reports of more than a dozen people injured by gunfire on Monday at a road junction in east Jerusalem, with police saying the assailants had been “neutralised”.
 






It later said paramedics and ambulance crews were providing medical treatment and evacuating five “seriously wounded people” who had been sent to hospitals in Jerusalem.
“Several other victims, with varying degrees of injury, are also being treated at the scene,” it added.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the shooting or what the motive was. Israeli police described the shooters as “terrorists” without saying how many had been involved in the incident. They also claimed that the perpetrators had been killed, according to Reuters.
The Israeli ambulance service said earlier that 15 people were wounded and at least five were in serious condition with gunshot wounds. Paramedics arriving at the scene found victims lying on the road and sidewalk near a bus stop, some of them unconscious.
Footage from a dashboard camera at the scene showed people fleeing from the vicinity of a bus stopped by the side of a road as shots rang out. Another video showed a bus’s windscreen and windows pierced with bullet holes.
“Suddenly I hear the shots starting … I felt like I was running for an eternity,” Ester Lugasi, who was injured in the attack, told Israeli TV from the hospital. “I thought I was going to die.”
Haaretz further said, citing the police, that the two suspects had been shot dead by “a civilian member of the security forces who was present at the scene”.
“The Israeli security establishment estimates that the two are West Bank residents, and that they fired at a bus and a bus stop at the junction,” the newspaper reported.
Haaretz also reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the site of the shooting after he conducted a situation assessment with officials. Speaking at the scene of the attack, Netanyahu said Israeli forces were pursuing suspects who aided the shooters.
Several weapons, ammunition and a knife used by the attackers were recovered at the scene, police said.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident, describing it as a “cowardly terror attack”.
“My thoughts are with the victims’ families. I wish those who were injured a speedy recovery,” he wrote on X.
 






In October 2024, two Palestinians, one armed with a gun and the other armed with a knife, killed seven people in Tel Aviv.
In November 2023, two Palestinian gunmen killed three people at a Jerusalem bus stop. Israeli security services said that the attackers in the 2023 Jerusalem shooting were linked to Hamas.
Hamas, Islamic Jihad do not claim responsibility
Meanwhile, Hamas issued a statement about the attack, not claiming it but saying it was carried out by two Palestinians.
“We affirm that this operation is a natural response to the crimes of the occupation and the genocide it is waging against our people,” Hamas stated, according to AFP.
Al Jazeera reported that in its statement, Hamas called for “more armed attacks in occupied territory”. It quoted the group as saying that Israel’s aggression against Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank “will not weaken the determination of our people and their resistance”.
Similarly, Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian group did not claim responsibility for it.
Al Jazeera reported that the group’s armed wing said in a short statement that the shooting was “a natural and legitimate response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist enemy” in Palestinian territories.
However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued a statement which condemned “any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians”.
Israel likely to retaliate for Jerusalem shootings: expert
Israel will likely respond to the shooting with acts of retribution targeting the homes of the gunmen, going by its track record of retaliation to previous attacks, Israeli political analyst Ori Goldberg says.
“I would assume the response would be extremely tactical,” he said, according to Al Jazeera. “They would try to identify the gunmen who carried out the attack, then they would go after their village or town of residence, [and] demolish their homes.”
He said in response to a previous attack, Israel had ordered thousands of trees to be destroyed in an attacker’s home village. “They would take all kinds of punitive actions,” he said.
“Israel is not capable of carrying out anything that is broader than a … tit-for-tat, trying to show it has the upper hand by using an excessive level of force,” he added. “This is true in Gaza, it’s going to be true in the West Bank.”</p><small>2025-09-08 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081643460572130.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940508/gb-police-chief-bans-use-of-tiktok-by-personnel-to-ensure-discipline' target='_blank'><strong>GB police chief bans use of TikTok by personnel to ensure ‘discipline’</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan police chief on Monday banned the use of social media platform TikTok by personnel of the force for the purpose of maintaining “discipline”.
A notification issued today from the office of the GB inspector general of police said: “In order to maintain discipline, uniformity and dignity of the force, it is hereby directed that no GB police officer/official shall use social media platform (TikTok).”
It ordered all district police officers and unit heads to bring the direction to the notice of all personnel under their command, warning that any non-compliance would be “viewed seriously and cause disciplinary action”.
In July, two constables from the Security Division Islamabad were suspended and facing an inquiry for allegedly violating the capital police’s social media policy by making and uploading TikTok videos in uniform.
Sources had said that dozens of other lower-ranking officials had been warned and directed to remove their TikTok accounts to avoid further action.
In March, the Punjab Police warned its officials against expressing “offensive views” about the state using their personal social media accounts.
In September 2024, the Islamabad and Punjab Police had devised policies regarding the use of social media platforms by officials and officers. The policies had restrained police officers and officials from giving any opinions or statements across all social media platforms.
Heads were also made responsible for personally supervising and monitoring the activities of officers and officials posted in their respective divisions, zones and units.
In the same month, the government had once again asked its employees to refrain from using social media to express political or religious opinions as well as from sharing information with any unauthorised government official or the media.</p><small>2025-09-08 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08134037412e972.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940482/two-gunned-down-one-injured-over-minor-dispute-in-nankana-sahib-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two gunned down, one injured over minor dispute in Nankana Sahib: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and another was injured on Monday when a “minor dispute” escalated into a gun battle between two groups in Punjab’s Nankana Sahib, according to police.
In a statement, Nankana police said that the incident took place in Sangla Hill and that two people were killed and one was injured; the latter was moved to the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad.
“As soon as the incident was reported, Nankana DPO (District Police Officer) Faraz Ahmed reached the spot,” the statement read, quoting a police spokesperson. “The scene of the incident was inspected, and orders were issued for the immediate arrest of the suspects involved.”
The statement added that the DPO visited the victims’ families and vowed that the suspects would “be arrested and brought to justice as per the law”.
Later, another statement from Nankana Police confirmed that following an operation in Sangla Hill, two of the suspects were arrested.
“A successful police operation was carried out under the leadership of DPO Faraz Ahmed,” the second statement read. “Two suspects involved in the incident were arrested, and further action is underway.”
A first information report (FIR) was filed on September 7 against four nominated suspects and two unidentified assailants under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. A copy is available with Dawn.com.
The complainant, who was at the scene, alleged in the FIR that the suspects approached his sons’ fruit carts on Sunday evening to buy some fruit. The vendors refused to sell, claiming that the suspects would not pay for the items. This dispute escalated, with the suspects allegedly abusing the fruit vendors.
“The suspects drew their weapons and shot one of my sons in the hand and the left side of his chest,” the complainant alleged. “His brother was shot twice in the chest, while my third son was shot once in the arm and three times in the stomach.”
According to the FIR, the complainant and other people tried to transport the victims to THQ Hospital in Sangla Hill, but one of the deceased succumbed to his wounds on the way, while the other was pronounced dead upon arrival.
The third victim was in critical condition, so he was referred to Allied Hospital in Faisalabad for treatment.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the “heinous” attack on the police station in Balcova, a district just west of the resort city, left two officers dead and a third “seriously injured”.
“The suspect in the incident, 16-year-old E.B., has been arrested and an investigation has been opened,” he wrote on X.
 






It was not immediately clear why the station was attacked, but footage posted by the Gercek Gundem news website showed mobile phone footage of a person in a balaclava, a black top and pale trousers jogging along the pavement carrying a rifle, then entering a building.
Another clip broadcast by Turkish TV stations showed a group of civilians helping to manhandle the alleged attacker, wearing white trousers, into a police van.
The DHA news agency said the assailant had used “a long-barrelled gun” while NTV television described the weapon as a “pump-action shotgun”.
Police immediately fanned out across the area, imposing tight security measures, media reports said.

While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

“A very big issue now is the increasing paucity of female staff in these places,” Dr Mukta Sharma, the deputy representative of WHO’s Afghanistan office, told Reuters.
She estimated around 90 per cent of medical staff in the area were male, and the remaining 10pc were often midwives and nurses, rather than doctors, who could treat severe wounds.
This was hampering care as women were uncomfortable or afraid to interact with male staff and travel alone to receive care.
The September 1 magnitude-6 quake and its aftershocks injured more than 3,600 people and left thousands homeless in a country already dealing with severe aid cuts and a slew of humanitarian crises since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign forces left.
The Afghan health ministry and a spokesperson for the Taliban administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taliban say they respect women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law and have previously said they would ensure women could receive aid. Its administration in 2022 ordered Afghan female NGO staff to stop working outside the home.
 
 

Humanitarian officials say there have been exemptions, particularly in the health and education sectors, but many said these were patchwork and not sufficient to allow a surge of female staff, particularly in an emergency situation that required travel.
That meant aid organisations and female staff faced uncertainty, Sharma said, and in some cases were not able to take the risk.
“The restrictions are huge, the mahram (male guardian requirements) issue continues and no formal exemption has been provided by the de facto authorities,” she said, adding her team had raised the issue with authorities last week.
“That’s why we felt we had to advocate with [authorities] to say, this is the time you really need to have more female health workers present, let us bring them in, and let us search from other places where they’re available.”
Sharma said she was extremely concerned about women in the future being able to access mental health care to deal with trauma as well as for those whose male family members had been killed, leaving them to navigate restrictions on women without a male guardian.
Peer Gul from Somai district in Kunar province, which was severely hit by the quakes, said many women from his village had experienced trauma and high blood pressure after the earthquake and were struggling to reach medical care.
“There is no female doctor for examinations; only one male doctor is available,” he said.
Sharma noted the growing shortage of Afghan female doctors as the Taliban have barred female students from high school and university, meaning a pipeline of women doctors was not being replenished.
The United Nations estimates around 11,600 pregnant women were also impacted by the quakes in a country with some of the highest maternal mortality rates in Asia.
Funding cuts, including by the US administration this year, had already left the health system reeling. Around 80 health facilities had already closed in the affected areas this year due to US aid cuts and another 16 health posts had to be shuttered due to damage from the earthquake, Sharma said.</p><small>2025-09-08 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622528-judicial-policymaking-panel-to-review-missing-persons-key-issues-on-oct-17-cjp' target='_blank'><strong>Judicial policymaking panel to review missing persons, other key cases on October 17: CJP</strong></a><br><p>

The  High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules-2025 were passed at the recent full court meeting of the IHC by a narrow margin, with six of the 11 judges voting in favour.
Justice  Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar  Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — the five senior judges who opposed the move and demanded certain amendments — would file their dissenting notes.
The newly promulgated rules substantially enhanced the authority of the chief justice, empowering him to nominate any judge to the powerful administration committee, while simultaneously eliminating the inclusion of the senior puisne judge as a de facto member of that body.

Dissenting notes ready to be filed after new rules divide judges

‘Misuse of powers’
A  day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice  Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan wrote a letter among their colleagues, expressing  grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused  to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way  the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient  time” had been provided for a proper review.
Also, according to  Justice Ejaz, the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) were officially gazetted without meaningful debate or approval by the full court. He claimed the voluminous document — spanning more than 600 pages — was circulated only a day and a half before the meeting, thereby reducing consultation to a “mere formality and making substantive input impossible”.
A senior IHC official, however, disputed this claim,  insisting that every judge had been fully on board during the rule-making exercise. He cited an office order, dated June 12, 2019, and issued by then chief justice Athar Minallah, which constituted a committee to draft the rules in line with those of the Lahore High  Court. The committee included additional registrars Ijaz Ahmed and  Salamatullah.
Input of all judges sought
According to the official, the draft rules were duly circulated among all the judges,  months before the meeting was convened, and their input was solicited.  Apart from Justice Sattar, he said, no judge provided any suggestions.
However,  the recommendations submitted by Justice Sattar were rejected by the then chief justice on the grounds that they appeared tantamount to empowering judges with suo motu authority.
One of the dissenting judges, nonetheless, claimed that the version of the rules presented at  the full court meeting was “different from the one previously  circulated”.
Administration committee
Defending the changes, the official maintained that only minor alterations had been made. For instance, Rule 237 now provides that the administration committee, headed by the chief justice, shall ordinarily comprise three judges, though the chief justice may nominate additional members if deemed necessary. Likewise, Rule 239 now stipulates that each member of the administration committee shall serve as an administration judge,  with their powers and responsibilities to be defined by the chief justice from time to time.
Previously, the senior puisne judge automatically served as an administration judge, granting him significant authority over court affairs. Under the revised framework,  however, the chief justice has complete discretion to assign administrative functions, a change that effectively curtails Justice  Kayani’s role.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ejaz reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the  process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Special bench
They specifically referred to the formation of a special bench to address the backlog of tax cases. on which both dissenting judges were placed and assigned more than 200 tax references to be heard daily from 9am until the court’s rising.
Their pending cases were reassigned to other judges. The IHC official, on the other hand, rejected the objections, citing the LHC  practice where specialised benches are also assigned to senior judges.
Referring to the ‘Roster of Sitting’ at the LHC’s principal seat, he pointed out that Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Javid Iqbal Wains sit on a bench for tax and commercial cases and hear such matters full-time from  Monday through Friday.

Across the capital, from upscale sectors to suburban communities, residents are hosting online Mahafil-i-Milad, streaming live naat sessions, and attending digital Seerat conferences.
Prominent platforms such as Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, and WhatsApp have become key tools for organising and participating in these spiritual events.
University students are actively conducting online naat competitions, Seerat quizzes, and live Q&A sessions with scholars — playing a proactive role in combining religious expression with modern technology.
Anam, a media student at International Islamic University Islamabad, said social media gave people the chance to make religious content more accessible, especially to younger audience.
Many mosques in Islamabad are also adapting the trend.
Some have launched daily live sessions covering Seeratun Nabi, while others have set up online donation channels to fund charitable activities during Rabiul Awwal.
Renowned Islamic scholars have taken to YouTube and Facebook to deliver special lectures, reaching thousands of viewers in real time.
Sadaf Sajid, a Qaria from Sector G-10, said Digital Milad is not a substitute but an extension of devotion.
“It allows people from different cities, even countries, to come together and celebrate the blessed month,” she said.
Joint online gatherings, where families from different cities and countries participate in collective recitations and prayers, are becoming increasingly popular.
Shireen, a resident of F-8, said her son was studying in the UK, and this was the second year they have included him in their family Milad via video call.
While physical celebrations — such as illuminating homes, distributing sweets, and attending mosque events — continue as per tradition, the rise of Digital Milad points to an evolving pattern of religious observance in Pakistan’s urban centres.

Police sources told Dawn that the transperson, who made a living by dancing at wedding functions, was at her home in Allama Iqbal Town, Maroot, on Sept 9 when two young men, residents of Chak 314-HR, reached there to invite her to dance at a wedding function.
Meanwhile, one youth forcibly raped the transgender person while the other kept watch. When people reached the spot after hearing the transperson’s screams, the duo took the victim’s wallet containing cash and documents and her mobile phone and fled.
A police spokesperson said the suspects had been arrested.
FRATRICIDE: A youth, along with his two cousins, was booked for shooting his elder brother to death over a domestic issue at Chishtian on Sunday.
The FIR registered with Saddar police stated that Ali Waqas, a resident of village Mari Shoq Shah, along with his cousins, Imtiaz and Qasim, argued with his elder brother, Zaffar Iqbal, over some domestic matter.
On Sept 6, Imtiaz and Qasim once again started arguing with Zafar. Meanwhile, Ali Waqas shot his brother with a rifle, killing him on the spot. Police said the main suspect had been arrested.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former National Party senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.

Traders, transporters, and businesses pledge support to opposition alliance

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
 
 

Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to capture his second US Open crown and sixth Grand Slam title, avenging his lone defeat in a major final by Sinner at Wimbledon in July.
“It’s a great feeling. I’m working really hard just to lift this trophy. It’s my second one but it’s still a dream come true,” said Alcaraz.
Alcaraz will reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner, returning to top spot on Monday for the first time since September 2023 after ending the Italian’s 27-match winning run at hard-court Grand Slams.
 


“It was one of the first goals that I had, to recover the number one (ranking),” said Alcaraz, who also defeated Sinner in an epic French Open final in June.
Alcaraz has now won seven of the past eight meetings and is 10-5 overall against Sinner.
“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,” said Sinner. “I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today.
“He raised his level when he had to … He played better than me today.”
Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the last eight Grand Slams on offer, winning four apiece to assert their superiority over the rest of the sport, including Novak Djokovic.
But while Sinner is 109-4 against the rest of the tour over the past two seasons, Alcaraz has had his number.
“It’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” said Sinner. “That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player.”
 


Sinner’s defeat at Flushing Meadows extends the longest drought without a successful men’s title defence of any Grand Slam in the Open era.
No man has retained the US Open crown since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008.
Anticipation for the third straight Grand Slam final between the game’s top two players assumed an even greater dimension with the presence of Trump.
It was the latest in a series of visits to major sporting events for the US leader after his trip to the NFL’s Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
 


He appeared before the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, waving to the crowd, which greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos. He was given a frostier reception later in the match though, when shown again on the stadium’s big screens.
A constellation of showbiz and sports icons turned out as well on Sunday, with rock star Bruce Springsteen, fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, actor Michael Douglas and basketball superstar Stephen Curry all on hand.
 






Start delayed by Trump visit
The start of the final was pushed back 30 minutes to allow fans additional time to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium as a result of tighter security measures in effect due to Trump’s attendance.
Even then, the 23,000-capacity venue was no more than three-quarters full when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game of the match.
As he did in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz pinned Sinner on the back foot early and broke a second time for a 5-2 lead before serving out to love.
With hundreds of spectators still waiting to get in at the start of the second set, Alcaraz sought to hammer home his advantage against Sinner.
He created a break point but Sinner hung on and stalled Alcaraz’s momentum, belatedly ramping up his game and surging 3-1 ahead as the Spaniard suffered a brief dip on serve.

Sinner levelled the contest at a set apiece but Alcaraz stormed back with another break early in the third, wriggling out of a tight spot on serve with the help of a sensational baseline smash that sliced away from his rival for a 3-0 edge.
He padded his lead with another break and quickly wrapped up the set, keeping his foot down to corner Sinner again to begin the fourth set.
This time Sinner saved two break points but Alcaraz made another charge in the fifth game, delivering the decisive blow for an advantage he never relinquished as the Spaniard became only the fourth man to win multiple majors on hard courts, grass and clay.</p><small>2025-09-08 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622513-president-pm-hail-pakistan-navys-bravery-and-role-in-safeguarding-maritime-borders' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM praise Pakistan Navy's bravery and role in safeguarding maritime borders</strong></a><br><p>

“Following the interior minister’s directives, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has constituted a special inves­tigation team to probe into the matter and submit its report within 14 days,” says an official press rel­ease issued by the Interior Ministry here on Sunday.
It said the team will thoroughly examine the circumstances and those involved in the data leakage will be identified and brought to justice through legal action.
Media reports say that data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was sold at Google.
They further said that information regarding mobile location was being sold for Rs500, mobile data record for Rs2,000 and details of foreign trips for Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed user names, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to major social media services, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the reports said quoting the PKCERT’s advisory.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added.  “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, without encryption or password safeguarding.”
PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised acc­ess to business and gove­rnment accounts; and malware deployment using credentials,” the advisory warned.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority (Nadra), told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

The practice now covers a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to turtles, parrots and even goldfish.
Rising demand has invigorated the industry, drawing in new providers and expanding available services. Yet calls for better accessibility remain strong, as many owners still struggle to find nearby facilities to bid farewell to their closest companions.
A study by the KB Financial Research Institute in June found that 64.6pc of Ko­­reans who had lost pets held a funeral — either through a funeral home or a veterinarian — up sharply from 38.7pc in 2023.
The share opting for cremation, which costs at least 150,000 won ($108) and is pricier than veterinary disposal, also rose from 29.5pc to 49.5pc. The surge is partly explained by legal restrictions.
Under Korean law, animal bodies are classified as waste, which makes unauthorised burials illegal. For those who do not choose a funeral, the only legal option is to dispose of the remains in a designated garbage bag, an idea that many pet owners find unthinkable. To some, the emotional relief that funerals provide is a stronger reason.
“Of course, there were no other legal options. But a much bigger reason was that I could be with her sincerely until the very end, even if it meant spending hundreds of thousands of won,” Kim said. “The feeling of ‘this is really our fa­­r­ewell’ gave me a chance to settle my heart.”
Lee Woong-jong, an animal welfare professor at Yonam College, noted that the rise in pet funerals reflects a shift in public perception in Korea, as pets in the past were often treated like “toys.”
“For current Koreans, pets carry deep meaning. Losing them can cause serious emotional distress, sometimes leading to what is known as pet loss syndrome. Funerals help families bring a beautiful closure to their bond with their pets.”
