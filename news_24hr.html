The arrests took place in 42 departments over possession, distribution and regular viewing of pornography involving children “under the age of 10”, France’s OFMIN, which is tasked with preventing violence against minors, told AFP.
OFMIN issued the warrant that led to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in Paris in 2024, and he remains under formal investigation by French authorities over illegal content on the popular service.
The arrests of the 55 men aged 25 to 75, which followed a 10-month investigation, took place from Monday to Thursday.
The men exchanged messages on Telegram and were in contact with “extremely dangerous” child sex abusers who have been in prison since last summer, Quentin Bevan, head of OFMIN’s operational unit, told AFP.
The large-scale operation began last summer with the arrest of individuals suspected of abusing children and posting images on Telegram. The suspects are being investigated for human trafficking and face life imprisonment.
“It took 10 months of investigation to track down these child abusers,” Bevan said. “Ten months of undercover work involving thousands of exchanges, analysis and detection of paedophile images by a task force set up at the OFMIN.”
The suspects either have children or grandchildren, or come into contact with children at work. Some of the suspects boasted of abusing children while they slept, but now claim they did not actually commit any crimes, according to investigators.
‘Pedophile den’
In a separate case, Durov has been charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist content.
Investigators have confronted him with specific cases ranging from child abuse to drug trading, scams, arms sales and the hiring of hitmen.
The Russian-born entrepreneur has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris’s demands.
While Bevan acknowledged progress in Telegram’s cooperation with investigators since Durov’s arrest, he said the platform was “barely fulfilling its legal obligations”.
He said that Telegram remains a “pedophile den” and a “platform of choice” for child abusers.
Telegram rejected the accusation in a statement on Thursday, saying that it “meets and exceeds its legal obligations to fight harmful content”.
The messaging platform has “always complied with EU law” and “consistently responded to all binding legal requests for years”, the company added.
Durov says Telegram has also sought to fight against child abuse for years.
In June 2024, France shut down the adult website Coco which was used to commit numerous sex crimes such as child sex abuse and rape.
After that, some perpetrators of child sex abuse are believed to have switched to Telegram, according to an investigator.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22212742d719f5f.jpg?r=212925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912633/several-dead-as-plane-crashes-on-california-neighbourhood' target='_blank'><strong>Several dead as plane crashes on California neighbourhood</strong></a><br><p>Several people are feared dead after a small plane crashed into a California neighbourhood before dawn on Thursday, destroying homes and setting cars on fire.
At least 10 houses were burned or hit by debris that spread over a wide area, and cars on both sides of a street were set on fire when the Cessna 550 slammed into the ground in San Diego.
“There are more than one fatality that we found so far, but we’re waiting to get the registered numbers that were on the plane itself,” said San Diego’s Assistant Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy.
“When it hit the street, as the jet fuel went down, it took out every single car that was on both sides of the street,” he said, adding: “We have jet fuel all over the place.”
Footage of the immediate aftermath of the crash showed a line of burning fuel linking the flaming cars.
Eddy said “miraculously” no one on the ground had been killed or seriously hurt.
Daylight revealed what a close call it had been for some people, with images showing the roof of one home blackened and collapsing. Vehicles were twisted and charred, with one still burning.
“We have one car fire that just will not go out no matter what we put on it right now,” Eddy told reporters.
The accident happened in thick fog when the plane, which had come from Kansas, was nearing the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.
The plane, which can carry up to eight people, went down around 3:45am (1145 GMT, 4:45pm PKT), according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), striking the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood.
The residential area it hit is largely military housing. San Diego is home to US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases and Coast Guard stations.
Zane Baker, a high school senior who lives in the area, said police officers had gone door-to-door getting people out of their homes.
“I immediately just rushed to the front door, just looking outside, seeing what’s happening,” he told broadcaster KTLA. “I made sure all my siblings were awake and they were conscious and they were okay.”
Baker, who described himself as a “Navy rat” — the son of a servicemember — said scores of people had been evacuated from their homes, with many now milling around in confusion.
“The entirety of our parking lots and other areas are completely filled,” he said. “A lot of the entryways are blocked. People can’t get in or out. It’s a confusing mess.”
The accident came at a time of heightened tension in the skies above America, with a number of incidents rocking public confidence in flying.
Air traffic control outages have struck the busy Newark airport on the East Coast at least twice in recent weeks, and in January, there was a mid-air collision over Washington between a passenger plane and a military helicopter.
This month, two people who were onboard a small plane died when it crashed into a residential neighbourhood northwest of Los Angeles.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2219112938702db.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Army’s top brass vows to stop ‘externally-sponsored terrorists’ from destroying national peace: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country’s peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“A comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, a decisive chapter of Marka-i-Haq,” the statement read.
It was observed that “following its military failure in the wake of the Pahalgam incident, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,” the ISPR said.
“The forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.
“These hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.”
 
 

It further said that the nation will take “all measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests”.
The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing “deep concern” over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.
“[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,” the statement read. “[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.”
Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the “sacred blood of the shuhuda (martyrs)” would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan’s “media and information warriors” for their role during the brief conflict.
 


A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (Fitna al Hindustan)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.
President, PM present baton of field marshal to COAS Munir
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter’s promotion to the highest rank in the military.
The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under “Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998”.

The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.
After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, “Today is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
“You have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,” the PM said, addressing Munir.
“The aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.”
The PM said that the field marshal “led our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve”. He thanked Munir for “his command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“The nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,” he added. “He not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.”

President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression”.
“The entire nation is proud of all of you,” he said.
The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton “in recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character”.
“Your military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,” Zardari said. “Throughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.”</p><small>2025-05-22 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22211604a7e9923.jpg?r=211644' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912629/punjab-launches-awareness-campaign-on-childrens-safety' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab launches awareness campaign on children’s safety</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Thursday launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children.
According to the spokesperson of the home department, the campaign called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’ was launched on the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister.
The statement said, “The home department released the first episode of a special animation series to create awareness about ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’.
“The campaign was launched to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors.”
The statement also said that the series introduced the characters named Haya and Bahadur, who educate children about “Good Touch and Bad Touch”, with a message for children stating, “We will not be afraid of those who touch us badly.”
Educating children about personal safety was the need of the hour, the statement said, adding that the series taught children about “appropriate and inappropriate physical behaviour in a positive way”.
With proper education and awareness, children can recognise and report inappropriate behaviour, it added.
It further said that parents and teachers must teach children how to report sexual abuse at home or outside.
The statement highlighted that children who face sexual abuse can be traumatised for life, saying, “It is the responsibility of the state to protect children and bring abusers to justice.”
The campaign will help protect children from abuse and sexual exploitation, it added.
According to the statement, the Punjab home secretary has directed the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau to conduct an awareness campaign for children.
The department had also written a letter to the Education Department to include ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’ awareness in the curriculum.
The awareness campaign has been designed to keep future generations safe, the statement said, adding, “Be a part of this awareness campaign to keep your children safe.”
Earlier this month, a civil society report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
A 17-year-old girl died by suicide in April after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh.
On Tuesday, the police arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore.</p><small>2025-05-22 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2220024382ca58f.jpg?r=205222' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912630/iran-says-will-hold-us-responsible-for-any-israeli-attack-on-its-nuclear-sites' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says will hold US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear sites</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran would hold the United States responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities, after US media reported that Israel was preparing for a strike.
The report came even as Iran and the United States were set to meet in Rome on Friday for a fifth round of Omani-mediated nuclear talks.
“We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime (Israel), the US government will also be involved and bear legal responsibility,” Araghchi said in a letter to the United Nations published on Thursday.
“Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime and will respond decisively to any threat or unlawful act by this regime,” Araghchi added.
On Tuesday, CNN reported that Israel was making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.
The nuclear talks, which began on April 12, are the highest-level contact between the long-time foes since the United States in 2018 pulled out of a landmark deal between Iran and world powers, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office.
Israel, Iran’s sworn enemy, has been threatening to use force against Iranian nuclear sites since the talks began.
On Thursday, Ali Mohammad Naini, the spokesman for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned of a “devastating” response in case of an Israeli attack.
“If the delusional Zionist regime commits a foolish act and launches an attack, it will definitely receive a devastating and decisive response in its small and vulnerable geography,” said Naini, according to the ISNA news agency.
Also on Thursday, a group of demonstrators gathered near the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant south of Tehran to voice their support for the country’s nuclear activities.
The crowd waved Iranian flags and chanted slogans such as “nuclear energy is our inalienable right” and “no compromise, no surrender, only confrontation with America”.
Iran does not recognise Israel and generally refers to it as the “Zionist regime”, and the two countries have fought a shadow war for years.
The two foes traded direct attacks last year for the first time, against the backdrop of soaring regional tensions triggered by the Gaza conflict.</p><small>2025-05-22 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22190831f8e948b.jpg?r=191012' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912625/pakistans-new-climate-minister-on-water-justice-and-a-warming-world' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s new climate minister on water, justice and a warming world</strong></a><br><p>In sweltering Karachi, as tensions with India simmer over the Indus Waters Treaty, Musadik Masood Malik sips an Americano. Recently appointed as Pakistan’s federal minister for climate change and environmental coordination, Malik left his previous post overseeing the Ministry for Water Resources and Petroleum to take on what he describes as an urgent and daunting role. In one of his first interviews since the March 2025 reshuffle, he speaks exclusively to Dialogue Earth.
Malik leans forward to list what he sees as Pakistan’s most pressing environmental threats: “Air pollution and its economic toll on the people of Pakistan. Water pollution and access. And solid waste [management], whether methane or carbon dioxide. These are the three major challenges we face,” he says.
But it’s Pakistan’s melting glaciers that concern him most. Before arriving in Karachi, one of Senator Malik’s first official visits was to Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan’s northernmost region and home to some of the world’s largest glacial reserves outside the polar zones. He was there to see the initiatives taking place under a United Nations project which aims to reduce the risk of glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF). The numbers, he says, speak for themselves: Pakistan is home to more than 13,000 glaciers, putting it on the frontlines of a warming world.
“As the population has increased, communities no longer live where their forefathers used to live. What if they’re in the path of these hazards?” he says.
Some 2,000 km from Gilgit-Baltistan, the minister faces an entirely different set of climate challenges in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and financial powerhouse. Chief among them is bridging the political gaps between the federation and the provinces, as well as navigating competing interprovincial interests.
A ‘theatre of disaster’?
Despite diplomatic pressure from India to block financial assistance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month approved a new loan for Pakistan. In a statement, the IMF confirmed it had accepted the Pakistani government’s request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), unlocking USD 1.4 billion to help the country respond to climate-related challenges.
While the funding represents a significant boost, Malik remains sceptical. “We still haven’t gotten over a lot of what happened during the 2022 floods. Commitments are made and they are not fulfilled,” he says. “Pledges were made for the Loss and Damage Fund, but was money put in that fund? Look at the quantum of commitments and then look at the drawdown, and the actual funding that has come about.”
He questions the entire global response mechanism: “Is it just the theatre of disaster, where we all get together and speak fantastic English and make great speeches?”
Recently, Pakistan urged relevant parties to expedite disbursements from the Loss and Damage Fund, as it continues to bear the brunt of extreme weather events and slow-onset climate impacts. “I don’t feel cynical,” says Malik. “What I’m doing right now is lobbying. And not just lobbying for Pakistan — though that is my first and foremost duty and responsibility. But I’m lobbying for the vulnerable; I’m lobbying for climate justice.”
The minister has been vocal at recent international forums, rallying for climate justice and the rights of developing countries, including at the Geneva climate summit, calling out what he sees as inequities in the global climate finance architecture. He criticises the disproportionate benefits going to a handful of countries. “What about the rest of the world?” he adds. “What about Pakistan?”
Water tensions
Domestically, one of the most heated environmental debates involves the controversial six canals project, in the Cholistan desert in southern Punjab. Water is a deeply political issue in Pakistan, where provinces have long contested their share of the Indus River system, which sustains the country’s agriculture-dependent economy. In this context, the six canals project, seen by some as a plan that would potentially reduce the water flow toward downstream Sindh province, has triggered fierce opposition. Sindh has expressed fears of reduced flows and decried a lack of consultation.
Malik defends the idea as potentially beneficial but stresses that trust and transparency between provinces are key. “The possible solution to protect the water rights for each province is to ensure a water telemetry system [to monitor usage] at every interdimensional junction so that every drop of water that flows is accounted for,” he says. Once that system is in place, he adds, provinces can be assured they are receiving their fair share of water “through science and technology and not through human intervention”.
 
 

However, public protests and rising interprovincial tensions have led authorities to pause the project until a consensus is reached. “We don’t want to do anything without the consent of provinces, and provinces should be consulted,” he says.
Malik reiterates his commitment to transparency and accountability in water governance moving forward. “There will be no unilateralism,” he says, adding that a robust telemetry system will ensure real-time water monitoring and equitable distribution.
The federal minister also stresses the importance of water productivity, an idea he believes is not given enough attention in Pakistan. “A 3 per cent improvement in water-use productivity for agriculture produces the same yield as 3 million acre-feet of flood irrigation,” he says. In other words: more crop per drop. The focus, he argues, should shift from expanding irrigation infrastructure to using existing water more efficiently.
When asked about the political flashpoint surrounding dam-building in Pakistan, Malik responds with a grin and a pun: “I’m not going to name the dam because I’d be damned if I did.”
Despite a recently announced ceasefire following renewed tensions and conflict between India and Pakistan, the future of the Indus Waters Treaty remains precarious. Following the Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India announced a unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan has strongly rebuked. “If there is a disagreement, the first step is bilateral discussion among the Indus commissioners. If that doesn’t work, there are secondary mechanisms — neutral technical experts can be consulted,” he notes. “The last resort is the court of arbitration. And this has been working in this treaty. And if this treaty has no value, then no treaty in the world has value.”
Malik claims India has violated the treaty multiple times. “It is one of the binding conditions of the treaty that commissioners have to meet periodically. India has already violated this. They also do not share enough information or data that helps ascertain the water flow in this bilateral system,” he says. He adds that India’s calls to renegotiate the treaty’s terms predate the attack in Pahalgam. “This raises suspicions — was Pahalgam used as an excuse to violate the treaty?” he asks.
From regional tensions to global inaction, Malik circles back to the human cost of climate change — particularly for Pakistan’s most vulnerable. “We lose [access to] schools and health centres. Our girls and our women get affected disproportionately by these devastations,” he says.
Then, in a quieter moment, the minister reflects on a more innocent past. “When I was growing up, we would catch fireflies in our garden, put them in bottles and take them in dark rooms, but then we’d come out in the garden and let them loose, lest they die. We’d chase butterflies in the evenings. Where are the butterflies and fireflies? Who’s chasing them? Where are the green parrots and the bulbuls? Have you seen them recently?” He does not expect an answer.
For Malik, the aesthetic and cultural loss, triggered by a warming world, is just as profound as the physical damage. The minister laments the loss of poetry and folk songs that once paid homage to Pakistan’s natural world. “Floods and climate-induced disasters do not only cause material losses,” he says. “They also rob us of our culture.”

Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
In a post on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. “In all languages, we care about pilgrims’ health. Explore the health awareness kit to promote health and well-being among pilgrims,” the post said.
 






The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the annual Haj agreement in January, which would see 179,210 Pakistani pilgrims perform Haj this year.
On Saturday, the Pakistan Haj Mission welcomed 38,229 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia (Madina and Makkah) under the government scheme since the start of the month-long pre-Haj flight operation on April 29.
 
 

The religious gathering has seen a high number of fatalities in recent years, with the number of deaths during last year’s Haj pilgrimage totalling 1,301 people. Saudi Arabia’s health minister had said that deaths were caused by pilgrims “walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort”.
At least 35 Pakistanis were reported to be among those who died during the pilgrimage in 2024.
Earlier this month, the government introduced additional facilities for pilgrims such as air-conditioned Mina tents, family-friendly accommodations, optimised luggage systems and high-quality transportation.

The meeting with the IMF delegation, led by the Fund’s Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department Jihad Azourat the PM’s Office, took place as Pakistan gears up to present the budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2.
“Pakistan is now moving from economic stability toward sustainable growth,” the prime minister said, emphasising that the government’s top priority was not only to sustain macroeconomic gains but to expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The meeting focused on discussions related to the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF programme in Pakistan. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress under the reform agenda and assured of continued support to assist Pakistan’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth.
The meeting was also attended by key cabinet members including Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Planning, Development, and Reforms, Ahsan Iqbal, and senior officials.
The IMF earlier this month approved the immediate disbursement of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty (EFF) and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR or special drawing rights 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p><small>2025-05-22 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/221038142f8d379.jpg?r=120200' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif' target='_blank'><strong>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India’s involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad will present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.
“We will present evidence of India’s involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,” he said.
 


“The relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,” he added.
He was referring to the Pahalgam attack last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, without evidence, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.
Asif further said, “BLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they’re involved in bloodshed here.”
In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that “Pakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency”, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.
Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn’t agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was “very irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war”.
He said Pakistan “will not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us”.
“Pakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,” he highlighted.
A day ago, the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”.
It noted that India had “failed” against Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.
 
 

On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.
China, Pakistan and Afghanistan agree their soil won’t be used for cross-border terrorism: Dar
In a separate development, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the trilateral meeting between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all sides agreed that their soil would not be used for cross-border terrorism.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Dar discussed the possibility of increasing diplomatic engagement with Kabul, referring to a statement by Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said, “We will look into all these aspects. I fully support the idea that we should settle issues with all neighbours. The core principle should be that there should be no terrorism from other countries.”
He said that he had categorically stated the position that “we will not tolerate terrorism” during his visit to Afghanistan. “You should not allow use of your soil and we will not allow our soil,” he added, referring to his talks with Afghan Taliban leaders.
Dar also said, “The government has a clear resolve. We will deal with terrorism the same way we dealt in 2013 and 2018.
“The Chinese interest also lies in this. […] This was also discussed in the trilateral meeting,” the deputy premier said, referring to the recent moot in China.
 


The foreign minister further said that in his meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the latter offered condolences for the Pakistani lives lost during the recent conflict with India.
“He reaffirmed that Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its dignity were very close to them [China],” Dar said.
Dar highlighted that China agreed the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolutions, adding that Beijing, like Islamabad, believed that a major reason for the tension in the region was the Kashmir dispute.
Indian High Commission staff member declared persona non grata
Separately, the Foreign Office said that a staff member of the High Commission of India in Islamabad was declared persona non grata for “engaging in activities inconsistent with his privileged status”.
“The concerned official has been directed to leave Pakistan within 24 hours,” FO said in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
The FO added that the Indian Chargé d’Affaires was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey the decision.
“It was stressed that none of the diplomats or staff members of the Indian High Commission should misuse their privileges and status in any manner,” FO said.
 






The decision came after India yesterday declared a Pakistani official persona non grata for engaging in activities not consistent with his official status in the country and asked him to leave India within 24 hours.
A statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said: “Charge d’Affaires, Pakistan High Commission, was issued a demarche to this effect today. He was asked to strictly ensure that none of the Pakistani diplomats or officials in India misuse their privileges and status in any manner.”</p><small>2025-05-22 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605675-sindh-govt-announces-summer-vacation-for-schools' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces summer vacation dates for schools</strong></a><br><p>

The court has reiterated that the murderer must pay for the crime with his life. It is, no doubt, a dire sentence — this paper, in principle, opposes capital punishment.
The judges, it must be noted, did commute the death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, and the kidnapping sentence from 10 years to one. However, when it came to the murder charge, it appears they felt it necessary to match the severity of the crime with the severity of the punishment. Many well-wishers hope that the verdict will bring the Mukadam family some closure after their long ordeal to secure justice for their murdered daughter.
 
 

Noor’s brutal killing had shaken the Pakistani public out of its reverie to take note of the misogyny and domestic violence prevalent in society. The case had been closely followed. The evidence, eyewitness accounts, and sequence of events stitched together by the media from police reports had painted a deeply unsettling picture of Jaffar and the tragic circumstances surrounding Noor’s demise.
 
 

It was evident that her death was the result of not just one person’s malevolence, but a preventable tragedy caused by several individuals failing to do the right thing at the right time. These individuals seem to have been quite aware that a woman was being held against her will and likely being subjected to violence, but ignored her plight. It is unfortunate that their role in the murder never faced enough scrutiny; it would have helped establish that violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, but it is enabled by society.
On a related note, it is also disappointing that the superior judiciary took so much time giving finality to the verdict. It ought to have taken the matter up with the urgency it demanded.

US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack, saying, “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now!”
“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” he added on social media.
 






Gunfire broke out on the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum in the centre of Washington as the venue held a social event for young professionals and diplomatic staff.
The victims were a young couple who planned to get married, the Israeli ambassador said.
A video clip circulating on social media showed a young bearded man in a jacket and white shirt shouting “free, free Palestine” as he was led away by police.
Police confirmed the suspected shooter walked into the museum after the shooting and had been detained.
“We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody,” Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith told reporters.
“Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire.
“After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.”
She said the handcuffed suspect identified where he had discarded the weapon and chanted “Free, free Palestine”. Police identified him as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered enhanced security measures at Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide after the incident.
“I have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,” he said.
“We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.”
“I am devastated by the scenes in Washington,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.
“This is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy.
“America and Israel will stand united in defence of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”
‘Unspeakable act of violence’
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said, “Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”
The targeted event appeared to be a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for Jewish young professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.
The evening was “dedicated to fostering unity and celebrating Jewish heritage,” with an invitation to the event saying the location would be “shared upon registration”.
“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC this evening,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement.
“We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue… Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
 
 

The museum is in downtown Washington, close to the US Capitol and just 1.6 kilometres from the White House.
Police Chief Smith said officers responded to multiple calls of a shooting near the museum at around 9pm on Wednesday evening (6am Thursday).
First responders found a man and a woman unconscious and not breathing.
Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.
Engagement
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told reporters the young staffers were a couple “about to be engaged”.
“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said.
He added that he spoke to Trump by telephone, with the president assuring that the United States will “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism.”

“We’ll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral depravity without fear and with determination,” Leiter said.
Emergency vehicles remained at the scene in the morning after police taped off the area.
“We’re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters.
“The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city, and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate.”</p><small>2025-05-22 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605665-senators-denounce-khuzdar-carnage-demand-justice-for-slain-schoolchildren' target='_blank'><strong>Senators denounce Khuzdar school bus bombing, demand justice for slain children</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail yesterday after meeting with incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan, Gohar said: “A long time has passed. The PTI is a major party, Khan sahib is the most popular leader. We want these difficulties to end now.
“This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better.”
 
 

Responding to a question, Gohar said that the PTI would issue a formal stance on the development. He added, “We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial.”
“Contacts have not been restored for now, but it is definitely our desire. Khan sahib has said that we never closed the door for talks with the establishment,” Gohar further said.
Gohar’s comments echoed those stated in a post on Imran’s X account, wherein the ex-PM said he was willing to speak to those who have power, in the best interest of the country.
Asked specifically about alleged intervention in politics, Gohar said, “We all say that the military should have no role in politics, […] and I say that whatever happens should be above politics.
“After all, it is a major institution. It has had an influence and remains, so I will request that whoever can play their role in making the situation better to do so,” the PTI leader added.
The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades.
The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, making him the first Pakistan Air Force head to receive two extensions.
Gohar also spoke about India, saying that “an air of war was still lingering”.
He termed that the Pakistani forces had secured an “amazing victory, which India could not have even imagined”. “In my opinion, this war was even more serious than the 1965 or 1971 wars, because both countries are now nuclear powers,” he highlighted.
However, he cautioned the nation to remain united and alert against India’s “another such attempt and nefarious intentions”.
Implications for military hierarchy
A Ministry of Defence notification said that Gen Munir’s promotion to field marshal had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998.
The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”
However, experts noted the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.
 
 

While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted: “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”
COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.
The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p><small>2025-05-22 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2214383849b454d.png?r=143902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912589/japan-taxi-driver-suspected-of-raping-50-women-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Japan taxi driver suspected of raping 50 women: reports</strong></a><br><p>Japanese police said on Thursday they arrested a former taxi driver on suspicion of drugging and raping a female passenger, with media reports saying there could be dozens more victims.
The Yomiuri Shimbun daily and Jiji Press reported that police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.
Last year, the man “got a woman, then in her 20s, to take sleeping pills which caused her to lose consciousness, took her to his home and committed an indecent act, which he filmed,” a Tokyo police spokesman told AFP.
Police arrested the 54-year-old on Wednesday on “suspicion of non-consensual sexual intercourse and violation of the law on punishment of filming of sexual parts,” he added without elaborating further.
Traces of sleeping pills were detected in her hair, according to media reports.
The footage recovered on the man’s phone and other devices dated back to 2008, the reports said.
Media also said that he was arrested last October on suspicion of drugging another woman and robbing her of 40,000 yen ($280).
He was later released before being taken into custody again in December for alleged indecent assault, the reports said.</p><small>2025-05-22 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605652-another-student-injured-in-khuzdar-school-bus-attack-dies' target='_blank'><strong>Another student succumbs to injuries sustained in Khuzdar bus attack</strong></a><br><p>

Exports witnessed significant growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, spurred by recent changes in the regional political landscape. However, trade with these countries continues to face considerable challenges, largely due to unfavourable government policies.
Despite this positive development in exports, the overall trade gap with regional countries widened, primarily due to increased imports from China, India and Bangladesh during the period under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries stood at $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.

Export gains to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka offset by soaring imports

Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-April FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 2.37pc to $3.743bn in July-April FY25 from $3.656bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.84pc to $13.530bn in 10MFY25 from $10.925bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 23.87pc to $13.191bn in 10MFY25 from $10.649bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China stood at $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 11.65pc to $2.070bn in 10MFY25 from $2.343bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased 14.35pc to $196.77m in 10MFY25 from $172.07m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 8.866pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year.
Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $0.51m in 10MFY25 against $1.25m over the last year. Exports to India stood at $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 52.46pc to $666.59m in 10MFY25 from $437.22m last year. Imports stood at $22.77m against $7.38m in 10MFY24, a growth of 208pc.
The Torkham border station remained closed for almost 27 days last month which disrupted the imports and exports to Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No formal data is available for trade with Iran, as most of it occurs through informal channels. However, Pakistan has adopted a barter trade arrangement, especially as smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG through Balochistan’s porous border continues.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 24.77pc to $668.94m in 10MFY25 from $536.12m. Imports grew 43.35pc to $68.87m in 10MFY from $48.04m over the last year. The uptick in trade followed the ouster of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has resumed rice exports to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 0.52pc to $326.90m in 10MFY25 from $328.62m the last year. This decline was attributed to reduced economic activity in Sri Lanka. Imports from Sri Lanka remained static at $49m during the months under review.
Shipments to Nepal fell to $2.17m from $2.42m over the last year.
Exports to Maldives rose to $7.96m in 10MFY25 from $7.67m over the last year. No trade activity was recorded between Pakistan and Bhutan during the current fiscal year or the corresponding period last year.

Due to the incident, a traffic jam was witnessed on the slip roads, which created problems for the residents, while the site was cordoned off by the authorities. According to the district administration officials, gas accumulated in the pipeline caused the explosion. They said that the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) officials were informed about the incident and asked to check the reason behind it.
District Emergency Officer Sibghatullah told Dawn that Rescue 1122 received a call about the explosion in the sewer line and rushed to the site. He said that two people were injured in the first gas explosion and four people were injured in the second explosion. He said the injured were moved to Holy Family Hospital, where their condition was termed stable.
Meanwhile, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited officials checked the area and said the sewer pipeline exploded because there was no gas leakage in the SNGPL pipelines. “It is strange that the two explosions occurred on a road which was reconstructed last year. We suspect that the civic agency possibly used substandard material,” said Muhammad Fareed, a shopkeeper.
A resident Nasir Ali hoped that the relevant department would fill the ditch soon because it was causing problems for the people, especially the schoolchildren. He said that the civic bodies needed to excavate the entire portion to check the status of the utility lines.
Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf told Dawn the explosion did not occur in Wasa’s sewer line. He said that the drain was not a part of Wasa’s designated tributaries of Leh Nullah scheduled for one-time cleaning. He said that twin explosions occurred in front of Sunrise Bakery, E-Block, Satellite Town. The affected drain had no ventilating opening or manholes except for a single grating in front of the bakery, leading to gas accumulation.
He said that the explosion caused significant damage, such as the dismantling of the inlet gratings, damage to the concrete slabs, and displacement of the asphaltic layer on the adjacent road.
He advised the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation to remodel the drain to ensure proper gas ventilation and install manholes (ventilating openings) at regular intervals, not more than 20 metres apart, to mitigate the possible gas build-up.

In a statement, the commission issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”
It said according to astronomical models, the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, 2025, at 8:02pm PST.
The scientific analysis for May 27, 2025 (29 Ziqa’ad) in Pakistan indicates the age of the moon at sunset will be approximately 11 hours and 34 minutes, it mentioned.
“Even under the most optimal weather conditions, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country is extremely low, as there will only be a 37-minute interval between sunset and moonset,” it added.
The commission said 1st Zilhaj is expected to fall on May 29. Therefore, Eidul Azha will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
It added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon’s sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22132318c5f3acb.jpg?r=132340' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912510/wasa-clears-iesco-cda-dues-after-aid-from-punjab-government' target='_blank'><strong>Wasa clears Iesco, CDA dues after aid from Punjab government</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has settled its liabilities after paying Rs1.9 billion to the Islamabad Electric Supply Company and Rs1.5 billion to the Capital Development Authority with the aid provided by the provincial government.
Talking to Dawn, Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf said that the provincial government had been requested to provide financial aid to the agency to clear its liabilities. He said Rs1.980 billion owed to Iesco had been pending for the last two years for the electricity supply to 480 tube wells in the garrison city and the Rawal Dam filtration plant. He said that it was difficult for the agency to pay the electricity supply bills because of its meagre income over the last two years.
Regarding the CDA, there was Rs1.59 billion outstanding amount pending for the last 16 years against Wasa’s share for the operation and maintenance of the Khanpur Dam Filtration Plant in Sangjani.
He said that a year ago, Wasa did not have additional money available to pay its share to the CDA and the provincial government was approached with a request to clear the pending amount. He said that Wasa was getting 6 million gallons daily (MGD) of water from Khanpur Dam and it shared the operational and maintenance cost with the CDA.

Agency’s MD says Rs1.9bn paid to Iesco for electricity, Rs1.5bn to CDA for Khanpur plant operations

Speaking about the Wasa budget, he said the agency had planned to complete the annual budget next month, adding that this year, Wasa would present a surplus budget. He said that after getting the financial aid from the Punjab government, the income generated from the water and sewerage bills would be used to upgrade the water supply system in the garrison city.
Mr Ashraf said that Wasa had aimed to recover Rs2.371 billion in the current fiscal year and so far it has recovered Rs3 billion. He added that the recovery will increase in June as well.
He said in the last fiscal year 2023-24, a target of Rs1.570 billion was fixed and Rs1.717 billion was recovered, adding that the target for this fiscal year was Rs2.7 billion and the agency had already recovered Rs3 billion in 11 months.
“There are 134,681 consumers in the garrison city, and 96,971 consumers are paying their bills, while the recovery teams have been asked to bring all consumers in the paying category,” he said.
He said the basic reason for better recovery this year was the “new plan of recovery”, as the agency formed special teams to recover money from habitual defaulters without any discrimination. He warned that defaulters were being given time till May 31 to clear their dues, after which, the civic agency would not waive off late fee charges and instalments.

The dialogue mainly focused on aligning Pakistan’s fiscal strategy with inclusive growth goals.
The speakers said with a budget deficit of over 6.8pc of the GDP and debt levels exceeding 70pc, there is an urgent need to safeguard and expand investments in health, education, nutrition and social protection. Despite tax revenues below 10pc of the GDP, they said, development for children and marginalised groups cannot be delayed.

Say urgent need to safeguard, expand investments in health, education, nutrition, social protection

The conference on ‘Strengthening Fiscal Policies for Inclusive and Sustainable Development: Advancing Child and Gender-Responsive Public Investments’ was jointly organised by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Unicef Pakistan and Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). Government officials, economists, development partners and civil society representatives took part in the dialogue and deliberated on reorienting fiscal frameworks toward equity, sustainability and inclusive growth.
Insights from Unicef’s Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) revealed a persistent gap between policy commitments and actual social sector allocations, notably in provinces like Sindh where education spending has dropped to 1.8pc of GDP.
Anchored in the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme — specifically the equity and empowerment pillar — the speakers called for targeted fiscal shifts toward inclusive and people-centred development. Key priorities include digital literacy, green skills, education access and civic engagement, especially for women, youths, and under-served communities.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said Pakistan was navigating two IMF programmes — the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) — with contrasting objectives. While the EFF focuses on reducing energy circular debt and raising energy prices, the RSF emphasises green technology and climate resilience.
“This paradox presents both challenges and opportunities,” Dr Suleri said, urging policymakers to integrate climate tagging into development to empower girls and adolescents through climate-aligned and inclusive fiscal planning.
Unicef Representative Sharmila Rasool emphasised the importance of human capital in a rapidly changing global environment.
“Pakistan’s Human Capital Index stands at 0.41, which suggests that only 41pc of the children will reach their full potential,” she said.
Ms Rasool called for bringing about urgent reforms in tax equity and public expenditure.
She noted that Pakistan’s regressive tax system unfairly burdened the poorest while shielding the elites. She reaffirmed Unicef’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s efforts to align spending with equity, especially for children and adolescents.
Joint Chief Economist Ministry of Planning, speaking on behalf of Federal Minister for Planning, Dr Mohammad Ali Talpur, highlighted that under the Uraan Pakistan, fiscal policy must be a tool for social justice.
“Our fiscal decisions must uplift those most under-served — especially children, women and low-income families,” he said.
He announced the formation of a high-level technical working group to explore reallocation strategies, identify new fiscal opportunities and reinforce Pakistan’s commitment to inclusive development under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Director Research, Planning and Development Department, Government of Balochistan, Dr Lutfur Rehman presented the province’s challenges, including dysfunctional girls’ schools and inadequate spending on children’s services.
He also stressed the need for targeted investments to uplift marginalised populations.
Representative from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pir Aimal highlighted the geopolitical challenges in the tribal regions and said the province prioritised social sector financing under the 5Es-based Uraan Pakistan programme.
A representative from the Sindh government shared that post-flood reconstruction efforts were being directed toward social protection, education and healthcare. The upcoming provincial budget aims to balance disaster recovery with long-term social investment.
Ayesha Javaid from the finance ministry mentioned that for the first time, Pakistan’s federal budget was gender responsive. She acknowledged the extensive institutional efforts needed to incorporate gender into fiscal planning.
Head of Nust Policy Studies Department Dr Ashfaq Hassan Khan, presenting a critical economic analysis, stressed that Pakistan’s budget deficit was driven by soaring interest payments and that the current monetary policy, particularly high interest rates, was unsustainable. He advocated for a freeze on new infrastructure projects and called for immediate privatisation of loss-making state enterprises to relieve fiscal pressure.
World Bank representative Tobias Becker presented empirical findings under the Uraan Pakistan, indicating that the poor contribute disproportionately to the tax system while benefiting less from public spending.
He noted excessive subsidies in electricity and tertiary education and urged reorientation toward primary education and equitable subsidy distribution.
SDPI Deputy Executive Director Dr Sajid Amin Javaid underscored that gender was often treated as a residual issue in financial policy. He called for a dedicated public finance and social investment framework that incorporated gender, climate and private sector financing.
“We need a body focused on mobilising social investments and modernising our industrial and regulatory systems,” he suggested.
Member of Social Sector, Planning Commission said: “Real GDP growth stands at 2.38pc and inflation has eased significantly. However, poverty remains high and 25.6 million children are still out of school.”
Ms Bashir emphasised that inclusive fiscal reform was not a cost but an investment. A high-level working group will be convened to explore reallocations and alternative financing models targeting children, youth and women, she added.

It was a statement win for Gladiators, who came into the match against the defending champions as the league stage’s table toppers and the Saud Shakeel-led side hardly felt the heat of the big occasion.
After having posted 209-5, thanks to what proved to be a match-winning partnership between Chandimal and Faheem, Gladiators never really let United get away with the game as Usman took three wickets.
Chasing the big total, United — who will now face the winners of the first Eliminator between Karachi Kings and Lahore Qalandars — scampered on their way to 45-1 in the powerplay, with opener Alex Hales playing Faheem’s pace onto his stumps early in the innings.
The incoming Rassie van der Dussen responded to the slow start when he lifted two towering sixes over Faheem’s head in the seventh over. The South African went after pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr for two cracking boundaries in the ninth, but was undone by a deadly yorker.
 
 

Gladiators were 94-2 by the halfway stage after Salman Ali Agha and Sahibzada Farhan hit a four and a six respectively in the 10th over. Right after bringing up his half century in 33 balls, Farhan holed Usman Tariq’s spin out to Khawaja Nafay at square-leg.
As pressure increased over United, captain Shadab, who had slog-swept Usman for a six over midwicket, was stunned by a one-handed catch by his counterpart Saud, who jumped into the air to intercept the ball after Shadab had cut spinner Abrar Ahmed.
Faheem then returned to bamboozle the incoming James Neesham with an outswinger that chipped the bail off the stump before the Salman counterattacked with two boundaries as United reeled at 143-5.
But they got deeper in trouble when Mohammad Amir bounced out Imad Wasim.
A ramp shot by Salman off Mohammad Wasim suggested the batter could take the match till the end, but Usman’s return in the 18th saw him perish, with Naseem Shah following him back to the pavilion on the very next ball, virtually ending the proceedings before Amir and Wasim took the last two wickets.
Earlier, Chandimal and Faheem led Gladiators’ fightback after a difficult start. Getting together when Gladiators were reeling at 111-5 by the 12th over, the duo went on to play together until the penultimate ball of the innings, combining for 95 off 40 balls with Chandimal staying unbeaten at 49 off 29 (four fours and three sixes) while Faheem added 45 off 23 (four fours and three sixes).
Gladiators were effective with the bat in the powerplay, getting 68 off it but also losing three wickets; those of Saud and in-form batters Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz.
The fall of three wickets early into the innings did seem to play on the minds of Allen and Avishka Fernando; the Quetta batters present on the crease, with only 28 runs coming across the next four overs, also thanks to some tight bowling by spinner Imad and Neesham.
With Gladiators at 98-3 at the halfway stage, Fernando took on Imad in the 11th over, driving down the ground for four before slogging past midwicket for six, only to see Allen (41 off 27, seven fours) get caught in the same area two balls later.
The introduction of Shadab’s leg-spin in the next over brought about Fernando’s ouster as well, the right-hander getting trapped in front after adding 32 off 21 (two fours and a six).
Shadab’s return in the 14th over saw Dinesh Chandimal punishing the bowler for pitching it in the right-hander’s slot by two hits for sixes straight down the ground.
Chandimal cut Imad with prowess for a boundary and played a similar shot off Neesham for four more to bring up 150 for Gladiators by the 16th over.
As Quetta amped things up, Faheem bludgeoned Salman for a four before smashing his yorker for a straight six before Chandimal dispatched two fours and a six off Neesham.
Faheem took on Naseem in the next over, pulling for six and placing the ball past cover and backward point for fours. The left-hander dragged a slower one over the leg-side for another six before holing one out to Shadab in the final over, but by then Gladiators had enough on the board to eventually take the match.

The strong quake struck 82 kilometres (51 miles) northeast of Crete’s capital Heraklion at 3:19am GMT (8:19am PKT) at a depth of 68 kilometres (42 miles), the USGS said.
AFP journalists said it was felt as far away as Athens and Egypt.
Greek state television ERT said many residents in the Cretan regions of Rethymno and Lasithi were woken by the quake just after 6:00am (11am PKT) and quickly exited their homes as a precaution.
Local media showed supermarket items strewn on floors, and reported minor rockslides on rural roads.
The tremor “occurred at a great depth and there is no particular reason for residents to worry,” Athanassios Ganas, general director of Research at the Geodynamics Institute of the National Observatory of Athens, told ERT.
State news agency ANA said fire department units in Crete had been placed on general alert, with vehicles patrolling to assess the situation.
The mayor of Heraklion, Alexis Kalokerinos, told ERT that there were no particular problems in the city and that closing schools would not be necessary.
The quake struck just over a week after a 6.1-magnitude tremor hit near the island of Kasos east of Crete, and was felt in the outlying area.
The region, popular with tourists, has been hit with multiple tremors in recent months, prompting schools in Santorini and neighbouring islands to temporarily close.
Thousands of earthquakes, mainly of low magnitude, have been recorded since January between the islands of Santorini, Amorgos, Ios and Anafi in the Cyclades group southeast of the Greek mainland.
They have not caused casualties or significant damage.
Located where the African and Anatolian tectonic plates converge, the Aegean Sea is often hit by quakes.
But the region had not experienced a phenomenon of such magnitude since records began in 1964, experts say.</p><small>2025-05-22 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22110833acdeed8.jpg?r=110837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912537/sc-constitutional-bench-member-decries-embarrassing-plea-targeting-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench member decries ‘embarrassing’ plea targeting IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>• Regrets how CJP could mark cases to a judge mentioned in petition
• Observes it is embarrassing for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party
ISLAMABAD: Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Wednesday took exception to uncharitable pleadings on behalf of PTI chairman Imran Khan in which disparaging remarks were made against certain judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
“This is embarrassing even for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party,” Justice Hassan regretted, adding how the Chief Justice of Pakistan could mark cases to the judge mentioned in the petition after reading such remarks in the plea.
Justice Hassan was a member of the five-judge Constitutional Bench that had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kaya­­ni, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sat­tar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
In the petition, PTI founder Imran Khan had contended that the five IHC judges were punished because they decided false cases on merit registered and filed against the petitioner without fear or favour.
“Moreover, former IHC chief justice Aamir Farooq, who now was rewarded by appointing him as judge of the Supreme Court, was repeatedly asked to recuse himself from petitioner’s cases, but he refused to do so.”
“And when IHC judges made a representation to former IHC CJ, the same were dismissed forthwith, issuing a fresh seniority list in which the senior puisine judge of IHC was demoted from his position while a freshly transferred judge was put in the senior most position,” the petition had contended.
The petition went on to state that a few days later former IHC CJ was appointed to the apex court and hence rewarded for damaging petitioner’s case, life and liberty, whereas the judges who stood up against the illegal and undue external pressures were punished by having their seniority disturbed. The entire debacle clearly showed lack of good faith, which is a dagger in the heart of Pakistan’s stability, the petition had regretted.
While pointing towards Advocate Idrees Asharaf, Justice Hassan today observed that the counsel had filed two petitions on behalf of Advocate Raja Muqsid and PTI founder Imran Khan and wondered whether any political party or a politician could ever claim such a stance in his petition.
The counsel, however, explained that the petition, to which Justice Hassan was referring to, in fact was originally filed by PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen. The counsel made it clear that the points he highlighted in the petition he filed was based on legal plain stating that his aim in fact was for the enforcement of law and the Constitution.
However, Justice Hassan regretted that such a petition should be dismissed by imposing a heavy cost as a punishment, also stating that the system should be allowed to work.
Earlier, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi on behalf of former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association contended that the central issue in the present dispute revolves around the seniority of IHC judges and if CB settles the matter then other issues regarding the transfer of judges to IHC as well as taking of oath before entering IHC will become merely an academic exercise.
The counsel urged CB to interpret Article 200 of the Constitution under which the judges were transferred to IHC in a way that the matter should not become a case of judges versus judges rather it should enhance the concept of comity among judges and reduces the conflict.
The counsel was of the view the seniority of the judges who were transferred should start from the bottom of the seniority list of IHC though they could retain seniority in their parent high court from where they have been transferred.
The record showed that the seniority issue was kept hidden from the chief justices at the time of seeking consultation with them, adding the seniority conflict among the judges was created by the executive when they have no power to disturb the seniority. This is where the malice comes, the counsel argued. The case will now be taken up again on Friday.

Prof Dr Tipu Sultan, who heads the 250-bed hospital in Kohi Goth, told Dawn that around three weeks ago, a woman from a nearby village had given birth at the health facility.
She suffered complications and was referred to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where she remained under treatment for a week and died on Tuesday.
He said on Wednesday scores of people from nearby villages attacked the hospital, beat the staff with sticks and stones, damaged ambulances parked there and the health facility.
Dr Sultan said he and his colleagues had established the hospital several years ago, where quality treatment was being provided free of cost.
He said that the incident extremely saddened him. He said it was the second hospital in the world where treatment of fistula was being provided to women free of cost.
Dr Sultan, who was a former principal of the Dow Medical College, lamented that if such ‘hooliganism’ prevailed, who would provide services to the community.

• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.
The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his decision to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.
Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.
In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.
However, a participant told Dawn, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.
When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”
Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”
Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.
“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.
In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for eradicating terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.
He said that situation between Pakistan and India was de-escalating after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.
He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.
Meeting on housing
Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.
He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.
He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.
Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.
The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.
