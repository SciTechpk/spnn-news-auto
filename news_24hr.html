The report, ‘Cut Us Open and See That We Bleed Like Them’: Discrimination And Stigmatization Of Sanitation Workers In Pakistan, is based on data collected by Amnesty and the Centre for Law & Justice (CLJ) from six districts: Lahore, Bahawalpur, Karachi, Umerkot, Islamabad and Peshawar.
The researchers spoke to Christian, Hindu and Muslim workers to understand the impact of caste-based discrimination on sanitation workers, and their report highlights stigmatisation of the work because of its association with caste-designated occupations.
A majority of Christians in Pakistan today are converts from a caste historically assigned the task of cleaning, the report notes. Caste-based occupations such as scavenging and sweeping are associated with religious minorities in Pakistan, including “lower-caste” Christians and Hindus.

Amnesty report says hiring policies perpetuate caste distinctions; most workers earn below minimum wage, not protected by labour laws

This, in turn, has resulted in the designation of sanitation work, considered undesirable by wider Pakistani society, to non-Muslims from so-called “lower castes.”
 
 

The report quotes the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) that found in its 2022 report that 80pc of non-Muslim religious minorities are employed in the lowest grades for government jobs.
Women sanitation workers face “triple discrimination” at the intersection of religion, caste and gender. About half of the women included in the report reported workplace harassment.
Stigmatisation of work
Amnesty found that many workers who were part of the study experienced stigmatization, and they reported being called derogatory and insulting names. Many reported that they were not allowed to use the same dishes or eat in the same places as Muslims. Some participants stated that they regularly faced discrimination in public places.
The report pointed out that stigmatisation has also resulted in violence, particularly in the context of blasphemy allegations. The report notes that there have been several prominent cases of sanitation workers being accused of blasphemy, including Aasia Bibi.
 
 

In August 2023, a blasphemy accusation against two sanitation workers led to an arson and mob attack on more than 20 churches and 80 Christian neighbourhoods in Jaranwala.
Precarious work and no rights
The report mentions data collected by CLJ on nearly 300 government job advertisements from 2010 to March 2025, showing that the ads explicitly required applicants to be non-Muslim or so-called “lower castes” or gave preference to them as part of the job criteria.
This reinforces existing caste-based patterns of employment within sanitation work and ensures that so-called “lower caste” non-Muslims are pushed towards sanitation work.
In the analysis of data collected from five government agencies, Amnesty found Chr­istians were disproportionately employed, not only in lower grades, but also specifically in sanitation positions.
The study also found that sanitation workers in Pakistan can be categorised into three main employment groups: permanent, contractual and daily wage and the government bodies across Pakistan avoided regularizing sanitation workers, denying them job security, benefits and legal protections.
Sanitation workers do not fall into the definition of worker under many laws, and if they do, these laws fail to cover temporary and daily-wage workers.
The study notes several practices by employers to maintain a non-permanent workforce. First, some employers hire sanitation workers on 89-day contracts to avoid legal obligations under the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance that defines a permanent worker as someone who has completed a probationary period of three consecutive months.
Sanitation workers participating in the research were also found to be inadequately protected by social security and welfare schemes and they lacked awareness regarding social service and worker welfare schemes.
Minimum wage and laws
The minimum wage in 2024 was set at Rs37,000 per month in most of the country and at the time of the field research, it was Rs32,000 per month. Almost half of those workers who were part of the research received salaries below the minimum wage, while a majority of those who received minimum wage were men.
 
 

“Workers across all districts reported that their salaries were insufficient to cover their basic needs.” Besides the sanitation workers were found regularly subject to unsafe, and sometimes hazardous, working conditions. Sanitation workers participating in the study seldom received personal protective equipment or training in occupational safety and health.
In its recommendations, Amnesty International calls for action to address the issues of caste-based discrimination faced by the sanitation workers.
It asks the government and relevant authorities to eliminate the manual cleaning of drains and gutters and instead use machinery; amend the Constitution to include protection against caste-based discrimination as a part of the fundamental rights chapter; pass law recognising caste-based discrimination as per Pakistan’s international human rights obligations to address; define caste in the laws; end discriminatory recruitment practices, including discriminatory job advertisements, for sanitation work; amend labour laws to ensure safety; and end discrimination that sanitation workers face and regularise sanitation workers.

The negotiations in Sweden concluded shortly before 8pm, with neither side offering details on their progress, although a US Treasury department spokesman said they were expected to resume on Tuesday.
The United States and China earlier this year imposed triple-digit tariffs on each other in a tit-for-tat escalation, but then walked them back under a temporary agreement reached in May.
The expiry of that 90-day truce falls on August 12, but there are indications they could use the Stockholm talks to push it back further.

Both sides tight-lipped about outcome as negotiations to resume today

The negotiating teams in Stockholm were being led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Sweden.
They were meeting in the Rosenbad building, home to the Swedish government.
Before Monday’s talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said he did not expect “some kind of enormous breakthrough today” at the talks in Stockholm that he was attending.
“What I expect is continued monitoring and checking in on the implementation of our agreement thus far, making sure that key critical minerals are flowing between the parties and setting the groundwork for enhanced trade and balanced trade going forward,” he told CNBC.
Trade analysts said another 90-day extension of a tariff and export control truce struck in mid-May between China and the US was likely.
An extension would facilitate planning for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in late October or early November.
The Financial Times reported on Monday that the US had paused curbs on tech exports to China to avoid disrupting trade talks with Beijing and support Trump’s efforts to secure a meeting with Xi this year.
‘Shift’ seen in US approach
The previous round of China-US talks was held in London.
“There seems to have been a fairly significant shift in (US) administration thinking on China since particularly the London talks,” said Emily Benson, head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures.
“The mood now is much more focused on what’s possible to achieve, on warming relations where possible and restraining any factors that could increase tensions,” she told AFP.
Talks with China have not produced a deal but Benson said both countries have made progress, with certain rare earth and semiconductor flows restarting.
“Secretary Bessent has also signalled that he thinks a concrete outcome will be to delay the 90-day tariff pause,” she said. “That’s also promising, because it indicates that something potentially more substantive is on the horizon.” US-China Business Council president Sean Stein said the most important thing from Stockholm “is the atmosphere coming out”.

Trump has threatened both sanctions on Russia and buyers of its exports unless progress is made. “I’m going to make a new deadline of about … 10 or 12 days from today,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland.
“There’s no reason in waiting… We just don’t see any progress being made.”
Trump said he was disappointed in Putin and shortening the 50-day deadline he had set on the issue earlier this month. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.

Threatens Russia, buyers of its exports with sanctions if progress not made within 12 days

Trump, who has expressed anno­yance also with Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, has not always followed up on his tough talk about Putin with action, citing what he deems a good relationship that the two men have had previously.
On Monday, Trump indicated he was not interested in more talks with Putin. He said sanctions and tariffs would be used as penalties for Moscow if it did not meet Trump’s demands.
“There’s no reason to wait. If you know what the answer is going to be, why wait? And it would be sanctions and maybe tariffs, secondary tariffs,” Trump said.
“I don’t want to do that to Russia. I love the Russian people.”
Expressing disappointment in President Putin, Trump said, “I’m going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer what’s going to happen.”
The US president has repeatedly voiced exasperation with Putin for continuing attacks on Ukraine despite US efforts to end the war. Trump has played up successes in other parts of the world where the United States has helped to broker peace agreements and has been flattered by some leaders who suggest he should be given the Nobel Peace Prize.
 
 

Before returning to the White House in January, Trump had promised to end the conflict “within 24 hours”.
“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,” Trump said. “And I say that’s not the way to do it.”

• BJP govt claims success, opposition accuses it of hiding fact as Indian parliament debates Operation Sindoor
• New Delhi claims killing Kashmiri fighters under new ‘Operation Mahadev’
KARACHI: As the Indian parliament kicked off an animated discussion on Monday on the recent military standoff with Pakistan, a former home minister has challenged New Delhi’s narrative on the Pahalgam incident, questioning the claim that the attackers came from Pakistan.
The remarks from veteran Indian National Congress leader P Chidambaram came during an interview with The Quint, where he questioned the authorities handling of the April 22 attack and pointed out a lack of evidence to support New Delhi’s claim regarding Pakistan’s role.
“Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?” Times of India quoted him as saying.
He also questioned the role of the investigating agencies. “They are unwilling to disclose what the [National Investig­ation Agency] has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists or where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume they came from Pakistan? There is no evidence of that,” The Statesman quoted Mr Chidambaram as saying during the interview.
According to Times of India, he also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information.
“We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that gives you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?” he said.
Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Mr Chidambaram responded, “I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised… The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so.”
Mr Chidambaram further added, “They are also hiding the losses. I said it in a column that in a war, losses will occur on both sides. I understand that India would have suffered losses. Be upfront.”
The remarks prompted criticism from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which accused the Congress leader of defending Pakistan.
Union minister Pralhad Joshi accused Mr Chidambaram of giving a “clean chit to Pakistan”, while BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya alleged that Congress “always bend over backwards to protect the enemy”.
‘No pressure to end fighting’
In parliament, members from the treasury benches accused the Congress party of speaking the language of Pakistan and took exception to Mr Chidambaram’s remarks.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh began the discussion by skipping mention of any follow up on the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, and avoided answering a question about India losing warplanes to Pakistan by saying that the opposition was asking the wrong question.
“If a child gets good marks in the exam, the question whether he had broken a pencil or lost one was not correct.”
“We should not focus on whether (an examinee’s) pencil was broken or the pen was lost during the exam. Ultimately, the result matters, and the result is that our forces achieved fully the goals of Operation Sindoor.”
Mr Singh continued to make his claims though: “The opposition sometimes asks about planes shot down. Their question does not represent India’s sentiments. They have not yet asked how many Pakistani planes were shot down.
He also reiterated the Indian claim that Operation Sindoor was halted because India had fulfilled its political and military objectives. “To say it was done under any pressure is totally baseless and wrong,” he claimed, adding: “The aim was not to go to war but to compel the adversary to bend.”
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also claimed that President Donald Trump had played no role in bringing about the ceasefire. He said US Vice President J.D. Vance had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and told him that Pakistan was preparing to launch a major attack, adding that PM Modi told him that the attack would be responded to appropriately.
‘Operation Mahadev’
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s state broadcaster warned that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them.
The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged terrorists as part of the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar, Radio Pakistan reported.
While Indian media, citing sources, has been linking one of the dead to the Pahalgam attack, there has been no official word in this regard.
The Radio Pakistan report recalled statements made by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in press briefings held in April, where he had revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails… [and] 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.

THIS screengrab shows Khalid Nisar Dogar (centre) striking Ehsaan Riaz during Monday’s proceedings.

• PTI’s Khalid Dogar suspended for slapping treasury MPA; Sheikh Imtiaz punished for ‘pointing out quorum’
• Opposition lawmakers ‘accosted’ by two unidentified men on assembly premises after addressing presser
• ECP disqualifies three PTI lawmakers following their conviction in May 9 cases
LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Monday desc­e­nded into chaos, mar­ked by physical altercations, walkouts by the opposition, and heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition lawmakers over alleged political victimisation as well as the arrest of PTI opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar following his conviction in a May 9 case.
The session was abruptly disrupted when oppo­sition member Kha­l­id Nisar Dogar slapped treasury MPA Ehsaan Riaz during a discussion bet­ween Deputy Opp­osition Leader Moin Qur­eshi and Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar.
At this, Law Minister Sohaib Bherth, Ashiq Kirmani, and Moin Qureshi attempted to intervene. The scuffle reportedly began due to an exchange of harsh words between Mr Riaz and Mr Dogar, with provincial minister Zeeshan Rafiq also getting involved. The MPAs from both sides were seen slapping each other, leading to a “flurry of slaps”. The acting spea­ker adjou­rned the session for five minutes to de-escalate the situation, but it took more than an hour to finally resu­me proceedings.
Following the altercation, opposition members staged their first walkout and protested in the asse­mbly compound, chanting anti-government slogans and demanding the rele­ase of the PTI founder and the opposition leader.
‘Heated exchange of words’
Earlier, a heated exch­ange of words took place when opposition member Rana Shahbaz held a copy of the Holy Quran in his hand while speaking about alleged false cases filed against him. The speaker rebuked Mr Shahbaz for the act, as the PTI leader claimed he had been falsely implicated in terrorism cases registered at five police stations in three cities.
Law Minister Sohaib Bherth later expre­ssed reg­ret over the use of the Holy Quran in such a manner, urging the need for dialogue to resolve such issues.
The session also witnessed a fiery debate regarding the arrest of Oppos­ition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar.
Opposition members, including Tayyab Rashid, strongly condemned the arrest, calling it a violation of law and an attack on democracy, while claiming that the punishment was meted out for ‘exposing corruption’.
In response, Minister for Parlia­m­entary Affairs Mujtaba Shujaur Reh­man asserted that the opposition leader’s conviction was a court decision and not a political vendetta, as he alluded to the role of Mr Bhachar in the May 9 violence.
He also highlighted the government’s efforts to control inflation and accused the opposition of destabilising the country.
Ali Imtiaz Warraich from the opposition decried the labelling of political opponents, including those with health issues, as terrorists.
The atmosphere in the provincial assembly remained tense due to escalating political tension, with the op­­p­osition continuing its protest.
The ac­­ting speaker held two meetings with the senior members of the treasury and the opposition before resuming the proceedings after over an hour.
The chair suspended Mr Dogar for 15 sittings and later also Sheikh Imtiaz, who pointed out the quorum during the proceedings, as the opposition walked out of the house again.
The second walkout was prompted by the suspension of Mr Imtiaz.
Later, some MPAs came face to face again after two unknown persons clashed with opposition members as they were leaving the press hall after a press conference.
Following the clash, the two men also hurled abuses at opposition members. Assembly security staff arrived on time and separated the two sides.
It was alleged that the two unknown persons, who escaped after abusing the opposition MPAs, were the staff of some treasury members.
PTI MPA Ijaz Shafi said that as the deputy speaker has left, the issue would be raised before him tomorrow to ban the entry of the accused.
ECP disqualifies lawmakers
Separately, the Election Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday disqualified three PTI lawmakers, days after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha.
Those disqualified and de-notified by the election watchdog included Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, and MPA Ahmad Khan Bhachar, leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
Last week, the Lahore court had sentenced Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, while the Sargodha court had convicted MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha from Wazirabad and Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan from Mianwali.
All three were jailed for 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 violence and subsequently disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution.

Seven people were fired at after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz on Sunday against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — the state’s terminology for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP).
However, sources and eyewitnesses said security personnel guarding the installation had reportedly opened fire to control the crowd after the demonstration took a violent turn.

Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen march against militant presence in restive valley

A number of those who lost their lives on Sunday were laid to rest in the Bagh Markaz and Peer Mela localities of Tirah.
Besides the seven deaths, at least 16 people sustained gunshot wounds. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant admi­n­istration,” Dawn.com quo­ted CM Gandapur’s adviser, Barri­ster Mohammad Ali Saif, as saying on Monday. He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself.
Local sources claimed that security officials had accepted the tribesmen’s demand for compensation to the families of the deceased and injured tribesmen. However, no FIR has been lodged.
Separately, the PTI has called for an immediate and impartial inquiry into the Tirah incident, and asked for those responsible to be held accountable.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians was not only unjustifiable but also a blatant violation of basic human rights and democratic principles.
TTP ‘withdrawal’ demanded
Meanwhile, the Bar Qambarkhel tribe in the restive Tirah valley temporarily suspended its week-long protest against the presence of militants in Tirah after representatives of the banned TTP reportedly asked for some time to hold talks with their leadership in Afgh­a­nistan on the demand for their withdrawal from the valley.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to suspend the sit-in was announced during a jirga in Lar Bagh, after ‘successful negotiations’ between the Bar Qambar­khel elders and TTP representatives in the region.
Sources said the jirga was told that militant commanders had sought time till Aug 5.
Earlier, Malak Zahir Shah had led a protest of hundreds of tribesmen, carrying the Holy Quran in their hands, and demanded the TTP men leave their area.
They staged a sit-in in Bhutan Shareef, saying they would only end their protest when given assurances that the militants would exit the area.

• French, Saudi FMs seek concrete road map
• Pakistan, Egypt, Turkiye call for immediate ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian aid
• Death toll nears 60,000-mark
WASHINGTON: As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday warned “nothing can justify the obliteration of Gaza that has unfolded before the eyes of the world”, calling for bold international action to end the war and rescue the long-stalled two-state solution.
Speaking at the United Nations International Conference on the Israeli-Pale­stinian conflict, held at UN Head­quarters in New York, Mr Guterres said the decades-old conflict had “reached a breaking point” and urged world leaders to halt what he described as the “systemic dismantling of peace efforts.”
“The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has endured for generations — defying hopes, defying diplomacy, defying countless resolutions, defying international law,” he said. “But we also know its persistence is not inevitable. It can be resolved. That demands political will and courageous leadership. And it demands truth. The truth is: we are at a breaking point. The two-state solution is farther than ever before.”
 
 

Mr Guterres deplored the “wholesale destruction” of Gaza and described Israel’s “creeping annexation” of the occupied West Bank as illegal. He condemned the killing of civilians, the starvation of children, settler violence, and the mass displacement of Palestinians.
“Unilateral actions that would forever undermine the two-state solution are unacceptable and they must stop,” the UN chief said, reaffirming the long-standing UN position that peace can only be achieved through the creation of two states — Israel and Palestine — living side by side within secure and recognized borders based on pre-1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital of both.
Co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, the high-level conference was convened following the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution earlier this year.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who formally opened the event, echoed President Emmanuel Macron’s recent statement that France intends to officially recognize the State of Palestine in September. “We must move from the end of the war in Gaza to the end of the entire conflict, which threatens regional stability,” Mr Barrot said.
“Only the two-state solution will meet the legitimate aspirations of both peoples. There is no alternative.”
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, representing the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, called on countries around the world to “recognize the state of Palestine without delay”.
“The path to peace starts with recognizing the state of Palestine and preserving it from destruction,” he said.
Concrete road map
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud urged participants to support a concrete road map towards Palestinian statehood that also ensures Israeli security.
“We must ensure that it does not become another exercise in well-meaning rhetoric,” Mr Guterres remarked. “It can and must serve as a decisive turning point — one that catalyzes irreversible progress towards ending the occupation and realizing our shared aspiration for a viable two-state solution.”
A concept note circulated ahead of the meeting by the French and Saudi governments stated that the two-state solution still enjoys “near-universal support” and remains “the only way to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians… and create the conditions for regional peace and stability”.
Immediate ceasefire
On the sidelines of the international conference on the two-state solution, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar met Egypt’s Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty as well as Adviser for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Touhid Hossain besides holding a telephonic discussion with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
In a joint statement issued in New York, Pakistan and Egypt reiterated their unwavering support for the Palestinian people and their just cause, underscored the urgent need for unimpaired humanitarian access, an immediate cessation of Israeli hostilities.
Death toll near 60,000
Meanwhile, the humanitarian toll continues to rise. Reports from Gaza said Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food aid, killing at least 26 and injuring many more. More than 60 have reportedly died in attacks since dawn. At least 14 more, including a baby, died of malnutrition.
According to the Gaza health ministry, Israel’s ongoing military campaign has killed at least 59,921 Palestinians and wounded more than 144,000, besides since October 2023.

Khawaja on Monday moved a request to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif for not obeying May 7 Sup­reme Court directions to set up an independent appellate forum within 45 days over decisions rendered by court martial in the May 9, 2023 riots.
The direction has not been complied with and the federal government has disobeyed the order of the Supreme Court, plea­ded a petition moved before the apex court thro­ugh senior counsel Khw­aja Ahmad Hosain. The former CJP was also a petit­ioner in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA), which the five-judge const­itutional bench had taken up and decided on May 7.
The petition has been filed under Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 3 to 6 of the Conte­mpt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and Order XXVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980.
Earlier on May 7, a  five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had asked the federal government and the Parliament to consider bringing necessary amendments/legislation in the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) and allied rules within a period of 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the High Court against convictions awarded to civilians by the military courts.
The petition argued that the prime minister was liable for failure on part of the federal government to comply with orders of the Supreme Court.
The failure on part of the federal government to legislate and provide a civilian appellate forum renders all court martial proceedings against civilians as unlawful and unconstitutional, the petition argued, adding the appeal in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) and related appeals were conditionally allowed by the Supreme Court through the short order.
As no appellate forum had been provided within the given timeframe, the petition contended that the appeals now stand dismissed, and any subsequent proceedings under the legal provisions struck down by the Court in its original judgment dated October 23, 2023, are unlawful and unconstitutional.
The lapse of the 45-day period for enacting the legislation amounts to willful disobedience of the Supreme Court’s order, the petition stated, adding that no system of governance can function if the federation fails to comply with time-bound judicial directions.
Under Article 90 of the Constitution, read with the Rules of Business and past Supreme Court precedents, the prime minister—as the chief executive of the federation—is responsible for implementing court directives issued to the federal government.
Therefore, the petition argued, the prime minister is personally liable for contempt of court due to the government’s failure to act upon the court’s decision.
The petition further maintained that the case pertained to the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights—at its core, it was about the right to a fair trial and due process.
The petition reminded that the May 7, short order had held, the Constitutional Bench in unison, sensitise the need of legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.
The Constitutional Bench had expressly stated that it recognises the need for legislative changes which would be compliant with Pakistan’s international human rights obligations, and preserve the constitutional norms in the existing legal framework.
To uphold the Constitution and protect fundamental rights, the Supreme Court had directed the government to “consider and make” a law allowing civilians convicted by military courts to appeal in High Courts.
The petition concluded by stressing that the language of the short order was mandatory, leaving no discretion for the government. The government must legislate, and the legislation must provide a right of appeal to civilian courts for civilians tried by military courts.

• Authorities asked to prepare for another monsoon spell starting today
• Babusar Road ‘partially reopened’ as search continues for tourists swept away by torrents
LAHORE: Floods in the Indus and Chenab rivers have inundated over a dozen villages in several districts of Punjab, prompting the authorities to evacuate thousands of people to safer locations, while the government has asked rescue departments to brace for urban and riverine floods as well as landslides in light of the new monsoon spell starting today.
In the southern districts of Punjab, district administrations issued emergency alerts across different villages as floods in the Indus and Chenab destroyed houses and crops. In Rajanpur, standing crops were destroyed by the Indus, which also impacted Taunsa and D.G. Khan districts.
 
 

In Layyah and Taunsa, panic spread after a crack emerged in a ‘guide embankment’ built by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to protect the Layyah-Taunsa bridge. Though the bridge remained intact, the breach submerged Taunsa’s several villages, including Basti Kumharan, Basti Mangotha, and Basti Sohbewala, forcing the residents to flee. The floods in Taunsa also left entire settl­e­ments and agricultural zones submerged, with the rescue and relief operations underway to save lives and property.
Hundreds of people from Bait Ashraf and Jarh Leghari villages in Taunsa displaced by floods, meanwhile, awaited the government’s help, as their houses and the roads came under water, which forced them to relocate to higher grounds.
In Jhang, the raging Chenab River inundated more than 10 villages and destroyed crops and residential areas, besides destroying key road networks.
In central Punjab’s Hafizabad district, rapid erosion along the Chenab’s banks washed away hundreds of acres of farmland. Hafizabad and Sukheke were also affected by stagnant rainwater, which has not been drained for more than 10 days.
According to the PMD, low to medium-level flows are expected in the rivers Jhelum and Chenab due to the expected rainfall from July 29 to 31. It also said flash flooding was expected in the tributaries of the River Kabul and hill torrents of DG Khan from July 29 to 31. The PMD also forecasted a medium-level flood at Taunsa and Guddu in the Indus, while Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Sukkur are experiencing low floods.
A report by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority on Monday said that 152 citizens have been killed and 539 have been injured in accidents during the monsoon rains this year. 210 houses were affected, and 121 livestock were killed. The deaths were due to lightning, collapse of damaged buildings, drowning while bathing in rivers and electrocution, the report added.
Another rain spell
Meanwhile, the Nati­onal Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) stated that widespread rainfall was anticipated in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), with heightened risks of flooding, landslides, and urban flooding in vulnerable districts. The spell, which will start today, will end on July 31.
The NDMA instructed all relevant departments to remain on high alert, pre-deploy flood response teams and equipment, and ensure the immediate clearance of drainage systems.
In Punjab, significant rainfall is anticipated in Sargodha, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Narowal, and adjoining areas. Southern districts, including Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan may receive moderate rainfall.
Torrents in D.G. Khan and Rajanpur could be reactivated with medium flows, while nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range may also see a rise in water levels.
In KP, moderate rainfall and localised thunderstorms are expected to affect central and lower districts, such as Kohistan, Swat, Malakand, Dir and Buner.
Tributaries like River Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah may swell and contribute to rising flows in River Kabul at Nowshera.
River Chitral and its tributaries may also surge due to a combination of glacial melting and rainfall in Booni, Reshun, and adjacent parts of Chitral Valley. Urban flooding is also anticipated in Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, and Abbottabad.
The authority has also issued flood alerts for various areas of GB and AJK, as rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar, as well as in AJK’s Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh.
Babusar Road partially reopened
In GB, the Babusar Road was partially reop­ened on Monday as a search operation to locate the people swept away by torrents after heavy rains continued.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the Babusar-Naran Highway had “been reopened for one-way traffic”.
He further said, “Several families…have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in their search.” The TV anchor, who was reported to be among those swept away by floods, could not be traced on Monday, but her wrecked vehicle was found by the rescuers.
The Ghanche district administration also made arrangements for the displaced villagers from Kundus valley and Haldi, and provided them tents, food packs, and installed kitchens for them. The government also mobilised machinery to clear roads to the Kundus and Saltoro valleys.
Officials said a tent village with running water and electricity had been set up for the displaced people and damage assessments were underway which would be submitted for compensation. A mobile veterinary dispensary has been set up at the flood site, and a temporary power supply has been restored and all roads in the affected areas are currently open.
The Baltistan Division commissioner arranged 4,500 feet of pipe for the permanent restoration of the drinking water supply to the Kundus affectees and work on the same was in progress, which would be completed in two to three days.
GB Disaster Mana­gement Authority DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn that teams of GBDMA provide relief to affected areas round the clock and machinery had been mobilised to restore roads, irrigation and water channels.

The US State Department appointed Elizabeth Horst the acting ambassador to Pakistan on Thursday.
Horst, a senior career diplomat, was serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs before arriving in Pakistan to take charge of her position.
“Horst welcomed the economic progress and the government’s reform-driven approach, emphasising the US commitment to strengthening economic and trade ties with Pakistan,” the press release said.
The meeting served as an opportunity to exchange views on matters of mutual interest and to reaffirm the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Pakistan and the US.
The finance minister expressed appreciation for the longstanding support extended by the US towards Pakistan’s economic development. He particularly lauded the continued US support for macroeconomic stability achieved over the past year and a half, and welcomed the healthy momentum in bilateral engagement across various sectors.
“Recalling his recent visit to the United States, the minister shared insights from his productive meetings with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer in Washington, DC,” the statement continued.
He noted the encouraging progress in deepening trade and economic ties between the two countries.
Aurangzeb underscored the importance of the US as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and highlighted Pakistan’s keen interest in broadening bilateral cooperation beyond traditional sectors. He specifically pointed to the promising potential in information technology, minerals, and agriculture as avenues for mutually beneficial collaboration.
The finance minister also briefed Horst on Pakistan’s recent macroeconomic indicators, including sovereign rating upgrades and renewed investor confidence.
He outlined the government’s reform agenda focused on critical areas such as taxation and energy, aimed at unlocking sustainable, long-term economic growth.
“Furthermore, he shared updates on Pakistan’s successful entry into Middle Eastern capital markets, its upcoming plans for issuing the inaugural Panda bond, and future access to euro and US dollar markets,” the press release added.
 
 

The acting US ambassador reiterated US support for continued economic and political stability in Pakistan and expressed optimism for an enduring and robust business partnership between the two nations.
The meeting concluded with a mutual commitment to building on the momentum of current engagements to further deepen bilateral cooperation.
Last week, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, the Foreign Office (FO) had said.

Seven people were shot on Sunday after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to sources and protesters, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.
Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.
He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.
“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.
 






Saif also again slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a multi-party conference (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.
The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.
According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.
PTI resolution demands troop withdrawal, investigative commission
The PTI’s KP chapter convened an emergency meeting today, strongly condemning the violence in Tirah and signing a resolution demanding the withdrawal of armed forces personnel from the region.
“The committee is of the unanimous view that the prolonged military deployment under Article 245 (functions of armed forces) of the Constitution of Pakistan has created an environment where power is uncontrolled and accountability is practically ineffective, which has led to the violation of fundamental rights and the disruption of local peace,” the resolution, seen by Dawn.com, read.
“The committee strongly demands that the federal government cancel all notifications under Article 245 within 15 days and formally announce the withdrawal of military forces from the occupied districts,” the document added.
PTI members were ordered to present this resolution in parliament and ensure support from other parliamentarians for its passage. Additionally, it instructed the KP advocate general to move the Supreme Court “to withdraw the injunction order of December 22, 2023, which has suspended the Peshawar High Court decision limiting the scope of Article 245”.
The PTI committee also demanded the formation of an independent commission made up of retired judges and civil society members to investigate all recent incidents of violence, including the Tirah shooting.
“The commission should submit a report within 30 days, identify those responsible and pursue legal action,” the resolution read.
Protest and shooting
On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.
 
 

Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.
They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.
However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run Radio Pakistan and APP, did not mention any protest.
He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.
“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.
 






Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.
The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.
Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.
Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, while backing the protesters’ stance, have demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident. The lawmakers and their supporters also held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud yesterday against the shooting incident.
 






Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.
While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in April this year and December 2024, killing a child in each.
Recently, two children were killed on July 22 in a mortar shell blast in Raghzai village of the Tank district, Rescue 1122 said.
 
 

Tribal elders in Tirah and some other KP districts have long opposed any military operation, citing concerns over displacement.
Earlier this month, a massive rally of peace campaigners from Tirah Valley and Bara tehsil of the Khyber tribal district opposed an imminent military operation in Tirah. Tribal elders have also ardently criticised terrorist groups, recently deciding not to pay them any ushr (tax).</p><small>2025-07-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/282237156448339.jpg?r=223741' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927204/finance-minister-heads-to-us-for-final-trade-negotiations' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister heads to US for final trade negotiations</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has departed for the United States to engage in high-level negotiations aimed at concluding the Pakistan–US trade dialogue, the finance ministry announced in a press release on Monday.
Auran­gzeb and US Trade Representative Jami­eson Greer launched the negotiations through a telephonic conference call on reciprocal tariffs in May, agreeing to get into technical discussions in the coming weeks. The talks began after the US proposed a 29 per cent duty on Pakistani exports and later temporarily suspended the decision.
By July, talks in Washington had entered their final phase. Aurangzeb described the dialogue as “very constructive,” emphasising a shared commitment to resolving outstanding issues and moving toward finalising a broad economic framework.
During this visit, the finance minister will lead concluding discussions with senior US officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Greer.
“The aim is to formalise a comprehensive trade agreement expected to yield mutual economic benefits for both nations,” the statement read.
The finance ministry highlighted that robust trade and economic ties remained the backbone of Pak-US ties.
It noted that the US is still Pakistan’s largest trading partner.
“Pakistan is eager to expand cooperation into non-traditional sectors such as information technology, agriculture, and minerals — all offering significant growth potential,” it added.
It concluded that Pakistan seeks to boost bilateral trade beyond traditional goods by encouraging US investment in critical sectors, including energy and mining.</p><small>2025-07-28 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/282119258100811.jpg?r=214249' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202/ecp-disqualifies-3-pti-lawmakers-following-their-convictions' target='_blank'><strong>ECP disqualifies 3 PTI lawmakers following their convictions</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday notified the disqualification of three PTI lawmakers over their convictions in various cases, according to documents available with Dawn.com.
Last week, a Lahore anti-terrorism court acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
According to the notifications, Chaudhry, member of the National Assembly (MNA) Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and member of the Provincial Assembly  (MPA) of Punjab Ahmad Khan were disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, senteced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years).
The first notification acknowledged Chaudhry’s conviction in the case ‘The State vs Dr Yasmin Rashid, etc’, reading: “As a consequence, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, has become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for being member of [the] Senate.
“Resultantly, Notification No.F.3(2)/2021-Cord. dated 10th March, 2021 to the extent of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, as Senator, is hereby recalled with immediate effect,” the notice added, referring to the document notifying Chaudhry’s seat.
The second notice also acknowledged Chatta and Khan’s 10-year sentences on July 22, but in the case ‘The State vs Zafarullah Khan and others’.
“As a consequence, Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, MNA from NA-66 Wazirabad and Ahmad Khan, MPA, Provincial Assembly Punjab from PP-87 Mianwali-Ill have become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution … for being members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly of Punjab respectively,” the ECP notification read.
“Resultantly, notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord(1) dated 16th February 2024 to the extent of Mohammad Ahmed Chattha and notification No. F.2(6)/2024-Cord dated 17th February, 2024 to the extent of Ahmad Khan as returned candidates, are hereby recalled with immediate effect.”
Earlier this month, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah­­med Khan filed a reference with the ECP against 26 PTI legislators over ‘unparliamentary conduct’ during the assembly’s session on June 27.
The disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and causing chaos in the house.
However, the speaker formally rejected the petitions following successful negotiations between the government and the opposition.
In 2023, PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan was disqualified for five years following his conviction in the Toshakhana case.
In a notification, the ECP cited a court order and declared Imran disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution read with Section 232 of the Elections Act, 2017.</p><small>2025-07-28 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28204843975f13f.jpg?r=205748' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927201/three-killed-in-rival-group-gunfire-over-personal-enmity-in-kps-malakand-says-local-official' target='_blank'><strong>Three killed in rival group gunfire over ‘personal enmity’ in KP’s Malakand, says local official</strong></a><br><p>At least three people were killed and four others, including a woman, were injured in an exchange of gunfire between two rival groups in the Kharkai area of Dargai tehsil in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, a local official said on Monday.
“The violence was sparked by a personal feud,” Dargai Assistant Commissioner Shahbaz Khan told Dawn.com.
He confirmed that two men from one group and one from the opposing side were killed in the shootout.
Rescue officials transported the deceased and the injured to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Dargai, while one of the critically wounded individuals was referred to Mardan Medical Complex for further treatment.
The levies force was quickly deployed to the area to prevent further violence and secure the scene. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the complete details of the incident.
“This appears to be a result of longstanding personal enmity,” said AC Khan, adding that further inquiries are underway.
Last month, two people, including a woman, were killed and 11 others injured after unidentified men opened fire at a group of people returning from a funeral in Chashma Ganda area of Gumbat in KP’s Kohat district, an attack that police said was motivated by personal enmity.
In February this year, five people were murdered during a shooting in Peshawar’s Badaber area in what police described as personal enmity as the motive.</p><small>2025-07-28 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616195-germanys-karachi-consulate-suspends-services-for-non-eu-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Germany's Karachi consulate suspends services for non-EU nationals</strong></a><br><p>

According to the report, rescue teams from Sukkur were dispatched to start repair work after the incident.
Sukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.
“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.
Railways officials stated that it may take up to another five hours to restore the track.
Meanwhile, the Sindh government authorities have taken notice of the explosion on the track and ordered an investigation.
This is not the first time the train service has been attacked.
In June, the detonation of a remote-controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks derailed four bogies of the Jaffar Express near the cattle market in Jacobabad.
No one was hurt in the incident, but the attack was reportedly claimed by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards in a statement.
On March 11, the train became the target of an unprecedented hijacking, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.
Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. Radio Pakistan reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the clearance operation, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p><small>2025-07-28 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2819413880861e1.jpg?r=194231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927195/ppp-opposes-govt-move-to-ban-road-travel-to-iran-iraq-for-arbaeen-pilgrims' target='_blank'><strong>PPP opposes govt move to ban road travel to Iran, Iraq for Arbaeen pilgrims</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Monday criticised the federal government’s move to ban Pakistani piligims from travelling to Iran and Iraq by road.
Pilgrims visit Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that zaireen (pilgrims) will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security.
PPP leader Hassan Murtaza issued a statement today, saying: “The federal and provincial governments should ensure the safety of pilgrims with the help of security agencies.”
The state was responsible for the security of travellers, he added.
He criticised the ban, stating that it will severely affect the common man. “Why can’t a common man, who pays taxes to the state, travel by land?” he said.
The PPP leader said that pilgrimages were being removed from the reach of the poor.
“The Arbaeen pilgrims save up each penny to go on pilgrimage with their family. Visitors prefer travelling by road because it costs less money,” he added.
Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.
 
 

Pakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.
Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.
After the PM-interior minister’s meeting a day earlier, Pakistan International Airlines announced that it will start special flights for Iraq to accommodate zaireen from Aug 8 to 11.
Reacting sharply to the move, the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) rejec­ted the ban on Sunday, calling it unacceptable, unjustified and unconstitutional.</p><small>2025-07-28 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281923185fa10a4.jpg?r=192752' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927192/countrys-july-inflation-likely-to-remain-at-35-45pc-as-price-pressures-ease-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s July inflation likely to remain at 3.5-4.5pc as price pressures ease: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry on Monday projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5 per cent, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
Inflation stood at 3.2pc in June, the ministry said in its monthly economic report, while average inflation for the fiscal year ending June 30 dropped to 4.49pc, a nine-year low, from 23.4pc the year before. The country’s fiscal year begins on July 1.
The ministry said the economy is expected to sustain its recovery in the early months of fiscal year 2026, underpinned by an improved macroeconomic backdrop and growing investor confidence.
Large-scale manufacturing likely maintained momentum in June, supported by rising private sector credit offtake and expanding production activity, the report said. The rebound is expected to lift imports of raw materials and intermediate goods, while aiding value-added exports, it added.
Strengthening domestic demand, a stable exchange rate, and steady global commodity prices were also likely to boost exports, remittances and imports in July, reinforcing external sector stability, the ministry said.
According to the report, the automobile sector exhibited strong performance during Jul-Jun FY2025, supported by substantial increases in the production of cars (40pc), trucks & buses (96.8pc), and sports utility vehicles & pick-ups (74.6pc).
Cement dispatches stood at 46.2 million tonnes during FY2025, marking a 2.1pc increase over the previous year; however, domestic cement sales declined by 3.1pc to 37 million tonnes, while exports rose significantly by 29.5pc to 9.2 million tonnes.
However, it warned that recent heavy rains could pose risks to agricultural output and supply chains, potentially impacting the inflation outlook in the coming months.
Since June  26, rain‑ and flood‑related incidents have killed at least 266 people and injured more than 630 nationwide, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, adding that 1,557 houses had been destroyed.
Last week, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank (ADB) projected Pakistan’s economy to grow at a steady pace of 3pc in FY26, even as it lowered growth forecasts for the broader Asian region amid global trade uncertainty.</p><small>2025-07-28 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28194056f412f4d.jpg?r=194303' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927197/german-consulate-in-karachi-suspends-services-to-non-eu-citizens' target='_blank'><strong>German consulate in Karachi suspends services to non-EU citizens</strong></a><br><p>The German Consulate General in Karachi on Monday announced on social media that it will be closed for services to non-EU citizens “until further notice”.

According to Kasur District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Isa Khan, the suspect was arrested in an injured condition.
“The suspect had molested a little girl playing in a street in Shah Inayat Colony three days ago,” the statement said.
DPO Khan took notice of the footage and directed Station House Officer Asif Javed to arrest the suspect within 24 hours, it added.
The police said that the suspect was caught at Dhanpat Road where he pulled out a pistol to escape arrest. However, he was shot during a firing exchange and was arrested in an injured condition, the statement said.
It added that the suspect had been taken to the Kasur District Hospital for treatment.
“According to the vision of the Punjab chief minister, sexual abuse of women and innocent children will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the statement said.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
 
 

In January of 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin from a heap of trash in Kasur, five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death.
The case sparked outrage across the nation and forced the government into action in finding the serial rapist and killer.
The culprit, identified as Imran Ali, was convicted of the rape and murder case and sentenced to death. He was hanged to death in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Central Jail on Oct 17, 2018.
The heinous nature of the crime had seen immediate riots break out in Kasur — in which two people were killed — while #JusticeforZainab became a rallying cry for an end to violence against children.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-07-28 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616188-explosion-derails-jaffer-express-near-shikarpur' target='_blank'><strong>Explosion derails Jaffar Express near Shikarpur</strong></a><br><p>

The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged “terrorists” under ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar. While Indian media, citing sources, has been linking one of the dead to the Pahalgam attack, no official has stated that on record.
The April 22 attack in held Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people and sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed the attack on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
India had launched Operation Sindoor in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, which included the deadly strikes launched on Pakistan on May 7.
“After the failure of Operation Sindoor, India has once again initiated fake encounters under the guise of Operation Mahadev,” security sources said today.
Operation Mahadev has been “launched to conceal the setbacks of Operation Sindoor”, the security sources said, adding that the “Indian regime is allegedly preparing to use innocent Pakistanis, illegally and forcibly detained, in staged encounters, falsely portraying them as cross-border terrorists”.
 






India has seen fake encounters as far back as 2015. The National Human Rights Commission of India — a quasi-judicial body — identified 555 instances between 2008 and 2013, but activists say the actual count is even higher.
 
 

The objective of Operation Mahadev is to suppress the “growing freedom movement” in India-occupied Kashmir and to restore the “waning political credibility” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, the security sources added.
They said India was attempting to present Operation Mahadev as a “successful military initiative to erase the embarrassment of Operation Sindoor”.
The security sources highlighted that “immediately following the Pahalgam false flag operation, the Indian Army reportedly began a series of staged encounters”.
The sources further said that on April 24, two citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen, were “martyred in a brutal encounter by Indian forces after mistakenly crossing the border”.
Indian forces in occupied Kashmir arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris in a sweeping crackdown following the Pahalgam incident.
 
 

The Radio Pakistan report, recalling the press briefings held on April 29 and April 30 by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, read that he “revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails”.
“Additionally, 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.”
The security sources noted: “As is customary, following these alleged fake encounters, videos and photographs of the deceased, alongside planted weapons, are circulated in Indian media to support the official narrative.
“Reliable reports suggest that these detainees may be coerced into making anti-Pakistan statements and confessions before the media,” they added.
“Operation Mahadev appears to be a continuation of the Indian Army’s long-standing practice of fake encounters in IIOJK (Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir), where it has gained notoriety as a ‘fake encounter specialist’,” the sources said.
“India, having faced humiliation in the Pahalgam false flag operation and the failure of Operation Sindoor, now seems completely disoriented,” the security sources added.
Indian army says three suspected fighters killed in held-Kashmir
Earlier today, the Indian Army said its security forces killed three suspected fighters in India-occupied Kashmir during a clash in a wildlife reserve.
The Press Trust of India reported that the incident occurred in the Mulnar area of Harwan near the Dachigam National Park, around 30 kilometres from the disputed region’s main city of Srinagar.
“Three terrorists have been neutralised in an intense firefight,” the Indian army claimed in a statement on X.  “Operation continues,” it added.
 






The incident took place near the major Hindu shrine of Amarnath, to which more than 350,000 people from across India have travelled as part of an ongoing pilgrimage.
The army did not immediately identify those killed, but a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity that they were all “foreigners”.
Security forces have been hunting for the Pahalgam attackers, but they remain at large.
Clashes between fighters and government forces have drastically reduced during the last five years, but many local fighters have been killed since the Pahalgam attack.
Last month, the Global Peace Index 2025 placed the disputed region of Kashmir at the forefront of the critical escalation hotspots in the world.
 
 

The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, stated that the situation in occupied Kashmir exemplified the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscored the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.
The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been at the heart of the hostility between old rivals India and Pakistan, both of whom claim the region in full and have fought two of their three wars over it.
India accuses Pakistan of helping Kashmiri fighters, but Pakistan denies this and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiris seeking self-determination.
India’s defence minister denies bowing to pressure to end fighting
Meanwhile, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that New Delhi had ended its military conflict with Pakistan in May as it had met all its objectives and had not responded to pressure, rejecting United States President Donald Trump’s stance that he brokered the truce.
Singh was speaking today at the opening of a discussion in parliament on the Pahalgam attack.
“India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,” Singh said. “To suggest that the operation was called off under pressure is baseless and entirely incorrect.”
Pakistan thanked Trump for brokering the agreement, but India said Washington had no hand in it and that New Delhi and Islamabad had agreed between themselves to end the fighting.
During today’s parliament session, Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi slammed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, noting that it had been 100 days since the Pahalgam attack but the government “has not been able to catch those five terrorists”, ANI reported.
Indian opposition groups have questioned what they say is the intelligence failure behind the Pahalgam attack and the government’s inability to capture the assailants — issues they are expected to raise during the parliamentary discussion.
They have also criticised Modi for coming under pressure from Trump and agreeing to end the conflict, along with Indian jets being shot down during the fighting.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p><small>2025-07-28 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281601492588078.jpg?r=180858' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927170/man-allegedly-kills-3-family-members-in-mandi-bahauddin-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly kills 3 family members in Mandi Bahauddin: police</strong></a><br><p>A man allegedly shot dead his parents and wife over a domestic dispute in the Asadullahpur village of Phalia Tehsil in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, police said on Monday.
Mandi Bahauddin Police Sub-Inspector Zohaib Warraich confirmed the incident, stating: “A deeply tragic event took place in Asadullahpur village where a young man shot and killed his parents and wife.
“Evidence has been collected, and search teams have been formed. The suspect will be arrested soon.”
A first information report (FIR) was registered at the Bhagat police station under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the police “received a call about the suspect allegedly shooting and killing his father, mother, and wife over a disagreement involving the sale proceeds of agricultural land”.
The deceased father had recently sold four kanals of agricultural land for approximately Rs20 million. His son, who returned to his native area from Kuwait just four days ago, demanded his share of the sale proceeds from his father, police said.
But as his father refused, the man pulled out a pistol in a fit of rage and opened fire. As a result, his 75-year-old father, 70-year-old mother, and 35-year-old wife died on the spot. The suspect fled the scene with the murder weapon, according to the FIR.
A police team from Bhagat police station arrived at the scene immediately and started an investigation. The bodies were taken to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for an autopsy.
Police cordoned off the crime scene to collect evidence, and a forensic team was summoned, per the police.
 
 

Mandi Bahauddin District Police Officer (DPO) Waseem Riaz Khan visited the scene of the incident and instructed police to immediately apprehend the suspect.
Punjab Inspector General (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took notice of the incident and sought a report from DPO Riaz and Gujranwala Regional Police Officer (RPO) Tayyab Hafeez Cheema.
The IG directed the police officers to apprehend the suspect without delay and bring him to justice while also instructing them to provide legal assistance to the aggrieved family.
Earlier this month, four members of a woman’s family were shot dead in Nowshera’s Tatara area, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, police said.
In February, a man and his sons killed three women and injured three others of his brother’s family over a property dispute in the suburbs of Sargodha.</p><small>2025-07-28 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2817564408cdc2a.jpg?r=175659' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927128/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-truce-after-5-days-of-fighting' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand and Cambodia agree truce after 5 days of fighting</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia’s leaders agreed to an “unconditional” ceasefire on Monday, after five days of combat along their jungle-clad frontier that has killed at least 36 people.
More than 200,000 people have fled as the two sides fired artillery, rockets and guns in a battle over the long-disputed area, which is home to a smattering of ancient temples.
The flare-up was the deadliest since violence raged sporadically from 2008-2011 over the territory, claimed by both sides because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia’s French colonial administrators in 1907.
Reading a joint statement from the leaders of both countries after peace talks, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said they had agreed “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” with effect from midnight on Monday (10pm PKT).
“This is a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security,” he said at a press conference in Malaysia’s administrative capital Putrajaya, flanked by Thai acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai and Cambodia’s PM Hun Manet.
 


Anwar said a meeting of military commanders from both sides would take place on Tuesday morning, before the countries’ cross-border committee would meet in Cambodia on August 4.
As the deal was being announced, an AFP journalist in the Cambodian city of Samraong — 17 kilometres from the fraught frontier — reported hearing continuing artillery blasts.
‘Very good results’
US President Donald Trump — who both nations are courting for trade deals to avert the threat of eye-watering tariffs — intervened over the weekend, and said both sides had agreed to “quickly work out” a truce.
“Today we had a very good meeting and very good results,” said Cambodia’s Hun Manet, thanking Trump for his “decisive” support and saying the truce would serve as “a foundation for future de-escalation”.
Ahead of the summit, Thailand and Cambodia had traded fresh fire and barbed accusations.
Cambodia’s defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said it was “the fifth day that Thailand has invaded Cambodia’s territory with heavy weapons and with the deployment of a lot of troops”.
 
 

As he departed Bangkok airport, Phumtham told reporters he did not believe Cambodia was “acting in good faith”.
After the talks hosted by Anwar — chair of the ASEAN bloc of which both Thailand and Cambodia are members — Phumtham called for the truce to be “carried out in good faith by both sides”.
“Thailand decides for peaceful resolution, while continuing to protect our sovereignty and the lives of our people,” he said.
‘Highly tense’
On the eve of the talks, Thailand’s military said Cambodian snipers were camped in one of the contested temples, and accused Phnom Penh of surging troops along the border and hammering Thai territory with rockets.
It said there was fighting at seven areas in the rural region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and fields where locals farm rubber and rice.
“The situation remains highly tense, and it is anticipated that Cambodia may be preparing for a major military operation prior to entering negotiations,” the Thai military statement read.
Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn marked his 73rd birthday on Monday, but a notice in the country’s Royal Gazette said his public celebrations scheduled for Bangkok’s Grand Palace had been cancelled amid the strife.
Trump has threatened both countries with high levies in his global tariff blitz unless they agree to independent trade deals — but said he would “look forward” to signing them once “peace is at hand”.
Each side had already agreed to a truce in principle, while accusing the other of undermining peace efforts and trading allegations about the use of cluster bombs and targeting of hospitals.
Nationalist sentiment
Thailand says nine of its soldiers and 14 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.
The Thai military said it had returned the bodies of 12 Cambodian soldiers killed in combat.
More than 138,000 people have fled Thailand’s border regions, while around 140,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
With the skirmish enflaming nationalist sentiments, Thailand warned its citizens to “refrain from any kind of violence, whether in speech or action” against Cambodian migrants living in the country.</p><small>2025-07-28 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616176-govt-offering-full-legal-diplomatic-aid-in-aafia-siddiqui-case-says-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Govt offering full legal, diplomatic aid in Aafia Siddiqui case, says info minister</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com: “A terrorist group was attempting to plant an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Nurar area.”
Upon receiving timely information, police and security forces took immediate action and surrounded the area, he added.
During the action, the police targeted the terrorists through drones and thwarted their plans.
“According to initial reports, the terrorists were killed while attempting to plant the IED,” the police official added.
“Bannu police are fully alert and ready to deal with any kind of threat, and all resources are being utilised to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the public,” DPO Kulachi said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Last week, in a series of assaults in KP, a police official was martyred in Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in the Basyakhel area of Bannu, officials said.
Also last week, a Frontier Corps constable was killed and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu district, according to the police.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616165-india-launches-op-mahadev-to-mask-failures-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India launches 'Op Mahadev' to mask failures in recent conflict with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical and spiritual affinities. However, the bilateral trade volume has declined significantly, from $11.2m in 2022-23 to $5.18m in 2024-25.
Addressing the fifth session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation, Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said: “We acknowledge the pressing need to revitalise our trade engagement and reaffirm our shared aspiration to elevate bilateral trade up to $100m.”
He added that Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan’s trade and economic relations would continue to serve as a foundation of their bilateral partnership.
Kyrgyzstan’s Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov was present at the session, along with delegates from the Kyrgyz Republic and Pakistan.
Leghari extended appreciation to the Kyrgyz delegates for their continued engagement and commitment to a “prosperous and interconnected future for the two nations”, noting the progress made across various sectors since the formalisation of their economic relationship in 1994.
“This session marks yet another important milestone in our collective journey of strengthening and institutionalising our bilateral partnership,” he said.
 
 

“Under the framework of this commission, our cooperation has steadily expanded across a broad spectrum — ranging from trade and investment to tourism, agriculture, energy, science and technology and education.
“It is heartening to witness the growing momentum, despite the challenges that continue to affect global and regional economic landscapes,” the minister added.
He highlighted the need for consistent and collaborative efforts between the two countries across multiple sectors to achieve their goals.
“The revival of the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, sustained business-to-business (B2B) interactions, and the early finalisation of a key Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on electronic data interchange between customs authorities, are essential steps forward,” he said.
Leghari took positive note of the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment, saying that the two parties were now looking ahead to expediting progress on the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Transit Trade Agreement, a key initiative aimed at “enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating seamless cross-border trade”.
He added that the signing of an MoU and cooperation in halal trade were a step towards achieving shared goals.
Leghari stated that investment remained a key area of priority and potential for both countries, drawing attention to the signing of the MoU between the National Investments Agency of Kyrgyzstan and the Board of Investment of Pakistan.
He said that the agreement provided a “solid foundation for targeted engagement” in high-potential sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, minerals, tourism, and information technology.
He appreciated Kyrgyzstan’s offer of access to the At-Bashi Logistics Centre for Pakistan’s National Logistics Corporation (NLC), saying that it stood “as a commendable example of enterprise-level cooperation, and one that we also hope to replicate across other domains”.
To foster broader private sector participation, he encouraged both sides to enhance the online visibility of investment opportunities by providing comprehensive and up-to-date information on Special Economic Zones, tax incentives, and priority sectors.
Leghari said that tourism and cultural exchange served as “powerful conduits” for deepening people-to-people connectivity.
“Both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, endowed with stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage, stand to gain significantly from closer collaboration in this domain,” he said.
“We look forward to finalising the MoU on tourism, hospitality, and investment, and to expanding the exchange of tour operators and tourism-related information, including active participation in international exhibitions.”
He called the signing of an MoU on cooperation in the field of agriculture a “pivotal step” towards promoting trade in Kyrgyz legumes and the export of Pakistan’s basmati rice, among other value-added food products.
“Enhanced collaboration on veterinary and phytosanitary controls will further facilitate safe and efficient food trade,” he added.
 
 

The minister noted both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan shared a vision of green and sustainable development, adding that they were aligned on exploring Pakistan’s participation in the proposed 500-kilovolt Torugart–XUAR–Gilgit-Baltistan transmission line, which would establish a strategic Kyrgyzstan–China–Pakistan electricity grid.
He also welcomed Kyrgyz interest in investing in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly in copper and gold exploration.
The minister stressed that strengthening transport and communication infrastructure remained “critical for the realisation of our economic potential”.
“We anticipate progress on the postal cooperation agreement, operationalisation of cargo under the 1995 International Motor Transportation Agreement, and improvements in e-commerce connectivity,” he said, adding that he was encouraged by discussions on expanding air and rail links, including flight frequency increases.
He called attention to the financial sector, saying that it served as a vital engine for economic growth.
“We appreciate the mutual interest in enhancing inter-bank and financial cooperation, particularly in Islamic banking and financial innovation,” he said.
He also praised the recent agreement between the State Bank of Pakistan and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic for joint training programmes, calling it “a constructive step toward deepening institutional collaboration”.
He added that the health sector also offered significant and strategic opportunities for advancing bilateral cooperation, saying, “We remain optimistic about the early finalisation of the MoU on higher medical education.”
The minister commended Kyrgyzpharmacia for its engagement with Pakistani pharmaceutical firms, particularly in exploring the supply of Pakistani pharmaceutical products to the Kyrgyz Republic and potential joint ventures in vaccine production in collaboration with the National Institute of Health.
He further underscored the importance of regulatory alignment and the need to streamline the registration process for Pakistani medicines in Kyrgyzstan, saying that they would help ensure timely access and promote greater commercial collaboration in the health sector.
“The cultural sector serves as a vital bridge, fostering mutual understanding and enriching the shared heritage between our nations. It is essential that we translate these affinities into formal institutional mechanisms.”
Leghari asserted that the finalisation of the Agreement on Culture and the organisation of joint cultural events would “significantly deepen” connections.
He also highlighted youth engagement as a “dynamic platform for cultivating future leaders and strengthening the bonds of friendship” between the countries, saying that younger generations could be empowered to advance the partnership via conferences, seminars on youth policy issues, and “the exchange of experiences”.
“Education forms the cornerstone of our partnership, serving as a catalyst for knowledge exchange and capacity building to advance sustainable development,” the minister said. “Our efforts remain focused on collaboration in STEM training, academic exchanges, and joint research initiatives.”
Leghari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Kyrgyz students through the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme (PTAP), encouraging the strengthening of institutional partnerships between the two countries’ universities.
The minister said in his concluding remarks that the commission’s fifth session offered a renewed opportunity to “transform (the countries’) shared vision into enduring outcomes”.
“Let us reaffirm our commitment to fostering a stronger, integrated, and resilient partnership, anchored in mutual respect, cooperation, and regional peace,” he said.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi last Thursday, while Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir met with Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28135856a0c340d.jpg?r=140050' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927139/babusar-highway-partially-reopened-as-search-operations-continue-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Babusar Highway partially reopened as search operations continue in GB</strong></a><br><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. At least 10 people died and four were injured as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.”
He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.
Faraq further said, “Several families, including five members of a TV anchor’s family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.”
The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child’s student cards, he added.
“The provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,” the spokesperson said.
Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, APP reported.
 
 

Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. “NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,” he said.
The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a “critical route for tourism and regional connectivity”, which was blocked at various locations.
According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.
Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.
“We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,” Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.
NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.
“To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,” the report added.
NDMA issues alert for rains
Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority issued an alert for the northern areas of the country, predicting rainfall from July 28 to 31 and warning about risks of urban flooding, glacial surges and landslides, APP reported.
It advised citizens to avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
 


According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.
“These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides,” it stated.
In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may raise the water flow of River Chitral, according to NEOC. “Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2814471205dc4e1.jpg?r=144719' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927147/unidentified-bodies-of-man-woman-recovered-from-karachis-china-port-police' target='_blank'><strong>Unidentified bodies of man, woman recovered from Karachi’s China Port: police</strong></a><br><p>The unidentified bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from Karachi’s China Port area on Monday, police said.
The deceased remain unidentified, but their age was estimated to be between 25 and 30 years old, according to South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza.
“There are bullet marks on the body,” he said, adding that two 9mm shells were also recovered from the site of the incident.
“Evidence is being collected from the crime scene,” the DIG said. “The identification of the deceased and further investigation are underway.”
Situated near Clifton beach, China Port, also known as Oyster Rocks or the South Asia Pakistan Terminal (SAPT) breakwater, is a man-made structure built by China to protect the port from waves. It’s a popular spot for locals, offering views of the port, cargo ships, and cranes.
Last month, a partially decomposed body of a young man was found in a desolate area in Karachi’s Scheme 33.
Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak had said the body of the man, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, was recovered from bushes outside the wall of Karachi University’s Teachers Society near the Superhighway.
The body bore marks of torture, he said, adding that the victim had sustained head injuries. The officer hinted at the possibility that the body might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car. The corpse was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital but his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
In February, the body of a trader, who was allegedly kidnapped, was found at Seaview.
Last year, the bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from a pond inside the sprawling Bagh Ibne Qasim in Clifton on the second day of Eidul Azha. According to the police, the victims were aged between 28 and 30, and it appeared that they had drowned around two days prior.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616150-bullet-ridden-bodies-of-man-woman-found-near-karachis-china-port' target='_blank'><strong>Bullet-ridden bodies of man, woman found near Karachi's China Port</strong></a><br><p>

The ADB is a key lender for Pakistan, with vital financing programmes underway, along with assisting in digital overhaul and climate policy plans.
As director general, Gutierrez will deliver ADB’s strategic agenda in the Central and West Asia region, which includes Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Her appointment takes effect today, read a statement by ADB.
“I am honoured to serve in this position and will continue to engage with developing member countries and stakeholders to promote inclusive growth, regional cooperation, and sustainable development across the region,” Gutierrez was quoted as saying.
 






Gutierrez has over four decades of professional experience, including 25 years at ADB, the statement noted.
“Prior to her appointment, Gutierrez was the director general for ADB’s Sectors Department 3, where she managed operations for finance, human and social development, and public sector management and governance.
“She is also a former director general of the Pacific Department. She has held senior positions in ADB’s Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department; Southeast Asia Department; and Office of the Secretary,” the statement said.
Last October, the ADB appointed Xiaoqin Fan as the new country director.
In June, Pakistan signed $1 billion financing for a five-year multi-tranche facility with the ADB. The same month, the bank approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-28 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616130-ndma-issues-flood-landslide-warning-for-gb-ajk-amid-more-monsoon-rains-forecast' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues flood, landslide warning for GB, AJK amid more monsoon rains forecast</strong></a><br><p>
