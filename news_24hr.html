One minute you’re enjoying fireworks, the next you’re staring at your inbox, wondering how you forgot your email password over the holiday break.
The glitter fades fast, and suddenly it’s back to deadlines, group chats and figuring out if you’re supposed to feel different now.
The new year often arrives with the pressure to improve: Cue the “new year, new me” captions and ambitious planners that still smell like a Kinokuniya display table.
But let’s be honest: Not everyone is in the mood for reinventing themselves. Maybe you’re in the mood for just a little glow-up, or maybe you’re just trying to get through your to-do list without spiralling.
Either way, here’s a mix of tools and tricks to help you ease into the year, whether you’re looking for fresh ideas, familiar favorites or just a little structure to soften the return to real life.
Don’t know where to start? Try a brain dump
Before you dive into your to-do list, consider starting with a brain dump. Think of it as emptying the mental junk drawer. Grab a pen and paper, and jot down everything on your mind, anything that you need to do, feel pressured to do or hope to do. Keep going until you run out.
Not a pen-and-paper person? Try a voice dump instead. Open your phone’s voice memo app and start talking. It can be just as effective, especially if your thoughts move faster than your handwriting.

Whether you’re writing or speaking, the point is to make space. Your first brain dump may not be complete the first time around, you’ll probably keep adding to it — but that’s part of the process. Once your thoughts are out of your head, you’ll start to see what actually needs your attention now and what can wait.
An added benefit for scatterbrains: You can’t forget if it’s recorded or written down. Just try not to lose that piece of paper (or forget which app you recorded it in).
Always on your phone? Let apps help you
If your screen time is already out of control, you might as well make it work for you.
Productivity apps like Todoist and TickTick are simple, ADHD-friendly tools that make list-making feel satisfying instead of stressful.
Todoist lets you use natural language (“email Rika every Thursday”) to set priorities and schedule recurring tasks. TickTick adds a built-in Pomodoro timer and habit tracker, which are great for people actually trying to change their patterns, not just log them.

If you want something more powerful, Notion, Coda, and Scrintal offer all-in-one workspaces.
Notion is basically the gold standard of productivity tools: projects, notes, databases, calendars, all in one clean interface. Coda and Scrintal have smarter AI features, especially if you’re juggling research or creative work.
While they’re not completely free, they offer a solid first step toward organising your chaos.
Prefer analog? Just write it down (with style)
For some, it still helps to write things down by hand. There’s something about putting pen to paper that makes a to-do list feel more real, and somehow more manageable. Sometimes your tasks only feel overwhelming because they’re swirling in your head. Writing them down often reveals it’s not as bad as it seems.
Handwriting also helps with memory and mental clarity. And no shade to digital calendars, but a whiteboard doesn’t emit blue light and won’t ping you during an existential spiral at 9 pm.

Having a small whiteboard in my workspace helps me keep track of what I need to do and gives me space to be creative at the same time. Making a to-do list suddenly feels more fun. And honestly, is there anything more satisfying than using a big marker to cross things off?
It’s a potential game-changer for both your brain and your workspace.
Think about food a lot? Go for Pomodoro or Eat the Frog
Now that your brain feels a little less cluttered, it’s time to actually check things off. Motivation is always the tricky part, so let’s start with some time-tested methods, the ones we keep returning to year after year, like a productivity version of “Auld Lang Syne”.
First up, the Pomodoro Technique. Designed to boost focus and prevent burnout, this method breaks your workday into 25-minute sprints, separated by five-minute breaks. After a few rounds, you take a longer rest to bookend the session.
Fun fact: It’s called Pomodoro because its creator, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to track his focus.

Then there’s Eat the Frog, which asks you to start your day by tackling your hardest, most important task; most likely the one you’ve been avoiding. That task is your “frog”.
The phrase derives from a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Once that critter’s out of the way, the rest are just tadpoles.
Everyone has their preference, but let’s be real: We always come back to what’s worked before.
Procrastinate like a pro? Make it a team sport
Sometimes, the only thing stronger than your will to procrastinate is the accountability of a friend. Call it body doubling, call it communal suffering, but doing things with someone, even virtually, can help you push through.
Set a timer, hop on a video call and silently work side by side. It doesn’t have to be the same task. You could be prepping a meal while your friend clears their inbox. Just the presence of someone else doing something can trick your brain into staying on track.

You can even gamify it if you want. Who finishes first? Who gets the most crossed off?
Just a heads-up: There’s a fine line between boosting productivity and becoming a distraction. Set a clear goal before you start, agree on a rough plan and try to stick to the same timeline. Think of it as accountability, not just company.

They made proposals in a formal statement issued at the conclusion of Wednesday’s conference in Islamabad, organised under the banner of the recently formed National Dialogue Committee (NDC). Ex-PTI leaders — including Fawad Chaudhry, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, Dr Shahzad Waseem, and Mahmood Moulvi — are leading the initiative.
“The meeting agreed to the proposal to initiate a fruitful negotiation process and declared that, in this regard, the government and the opposition should form separate committees comprising their respective representatives, between which the dialogue process should be initiated,” the statement read.
The NDC proposed that President Asif Ali Zardari, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif represent the ruling coalition in the talks. On the PTI side, it said: “After the announcement of the government’s committee, the National Dialogue Committee, in consultation with the opposition’s senior leadership in jail, will announce the names for the opposition committee.”

 

While the NDC also extended a special invitation to Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the opposition alliance reportedly refused to attend.
The NDC leaders also suggested that “comprehensive, concrete and practical steps be taken immediately for dialogue and confidence-building at the national level”.
These included the immediate release of “political workers” who were behind bars and the quashing of cases against them.
The NDC also advised that “all female workers, including” PTI founder Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leader Yasmin Rashid, be released immediately and provided medical facilities.
“Restrictions on political activities should be lifted. Complete freedom of political activities should be ensured within the framework of the Constitution and law,” read another suggestion.
The NDC also called for the appointment of opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate — posts that have been vacant since August 7.
“The government and opposition forces should not use the Pakistan armed forces for their politics and should not spread negative propaganda,” the statement added.

 

It further said that “censorship imposed on the media should be ended and restrictions imposed on anchors should be lifted”.
The moot also expressed concern over the “political unrest in the country, the economic difficulties facing the country and its people, restrictions on political activities and the media, and the challenge of terrorism”.
As per the statement, the meeting appreciated the NDC’s efforts of “playing the role of a bridge between the government and the opposition”, stressing the “importance of promoting unity and solidarity in the country and reducing political tensions”.
Ex-premier and Awaam Pakistan chief Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, expelled PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Liaqat Baloch, former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar, and journalists Mohammad Malick and Kashif Abbasi were also among those who attended the conference.
Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight in November when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore during his short release from jail.
The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that they had no political discussion with his client.
TTAP top leadership to visit Lahore
Separately, a TTAP delegation is set to depart for a three-day visit to Lahore as part of the opposition’s “street mobilisation”, said a statement from the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai.
The group includes TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Senior Vice-Chairman Allama Raja Nasir, Vice-Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Secretary General Asad Qaiser.
The TTAP leaders will hold “political and social meetings” in Lahore, the statement said, adding that the politicians will also hold meetings at Zaman Park, apparently referring to Imran’s residence.</p><small>2026-01-07 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071852092a28ee9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965642/kp-cm-takes-aim-at-centre-says-if-govt-wanted-to-eradicate-terrorism-they-would-sit-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM takes aim at Centre, says if govt wanted to eradicate terrorism ‘they would sit with us’</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday said that if the federal government wanted to eradicate terrorism, “they would have sat with us and formed a policy”.
Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals.
In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned the Centre about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda.
“We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.”
He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process.
“There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“
“A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.”
The CM noted that the KP government and the Centre had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy.
“We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much. They still have not received that money.”
Highlighting the impact of military operations, CM Afridi noted that families would lose breadwinners in collateral damage or terrorist attacks, causing them to suffer economically.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence.
Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.”
Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy.
Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province.
The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.</p><small>2026-01-07 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07183913329ab3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965641/iranian-president-orders-security-forces-not-to-crackdown-on-protesters-distinguish-them-from-rioters' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president orders security forces not to crackdown on protesters, distinguish them from rioters</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday ordered security forces not to crack down on economic protests, drawing a distinction between peaceful demonstrators and armed “rioters”.
Pezeshkian’s statement comes as Iranian cities continue to see a wave of protests against economic hardship triggered by price rises and currency collapse.
Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) claimed on Tuesday at least 27 protesters have been killed during the demonstrations that kicked off with a shopkeeper’s strike in Tehran on December 28.
Iranian media outlets, relaying official announcements, have reported 13 deaths, including members of the security forces and a policeman who was shot dead on Tuesday.
In a video released by the news agency Mehr after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Iran Vice President Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah said Pezeshkian had “ordered that no security measures be taken against the demonstrators”.
“Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters,” Ghaempanah added.
Army chief warns Iran’s foes
General Amir Hatami, commander of the Iranian army and one of its most senior military officers, warned Tehran will not tolerate outside threats “without responding”.

According to the Fars news agency, Hatami said “if the enemy makes a mistake,” Iran’s response would be more robust than during last June’s 12-day war with Israel.
In recent days, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if demonstrators were killed, while Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the protests.
The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of a 2022 to 2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.
But the economic protests have attracted international attention, including from the leaders of the Iran’s international foes.

 

“We’re watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump told reporters on Sunday.
Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israel’s cabinet: “We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice.”
The war in June began with an unprecedented Israeli attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.
The United States briefly took part in the strikes, hitting three major Iranian nuclear sites.
Tear gas in Grand Bazaar
The latest demonstrations have spread to the heart of the economy in Iran, the capital’s Grand Bazaar, and several more towns and cities, especially in the west of the country.
On Tuesday, clashes erupted in the Grand Bazaar for the first time since the protests began, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds. In one case, gas drifted into a hospital.
To disperse a crowd, “tear gas was used in the alley adjacent to the Sina Hospital”, the ISNA news agency reported, citing a statement from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
The Sina Hospital is affiliated with the university and is about two kilometres from the Grand Bazaar.
The university denied claims that tear gas had been deliberately fired at the hospital.
Elsewhere in the Iranian capital, calm appeared to have returned on Wednesday. AFP reporters saw residents conducting business as normal in the shops of Vali Asr, the grand thoroughfare that crosses the city from north to south.</p><small>2026-01-07 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643788-karachi-mayor-calls-for-culling-over-neutering-to-curb-dog-bite-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor pushes for culling over neutering to curb rising dog bite cases</strong></a><br><p>

Leg-spinner Shadab, who comes back after recovering from a shoulder injury — having impressed in the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia — is part of a Pakistan team that is missing the likes of star players Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf.
The trio, who are also featuring in the BBL, however, are likely to return for next month’s T20 World Cup with the current series serving as warm-up for both sides ahead of the showpiece, which is set to be co-hosted by Sri Lanka along with India.
Pakistan, hence, will focus on testing their depth for the tournament they didn’t fare too well in its last edition. They have picked the likes of hard-hitting batter Abdul Samad and uncapped Khawaja Nafay.
Batter Usman Khan and spinner Usman Tariq have also made the cut following impressive shows in Pakistan’s previous assignment; a tri-series title at home — the tournament having involved Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
“They are mega stars and they have done so well for Pakistan but the people we have brought here are very good players as well,” Salman told reporters on Tuesday. “They are the future of Pakistan, and hopefully they will come good.“
Shadab, meanwhile, after recovering from the injury, took seven wickets in six matches at 26.57 in the BBL and came in handy with the bat, scoring 104 runs across four innings.
“He came back from a long injury and he has done well in the Big Bash,” Salman said, while adding that choosing from a range of all-rounders available in the squad was a “good headache”.
“Managing all those spinners and all those all-rounders, I know it’s going to be tough, but to be very honest it’s a luxury to have all-rounders who can bowl and bat in any kind of conditions and situations.”

At the end of day four at the Sydney Cricket Ground, England had reached 302-8 with Bethell imperious on 142 not out and number 10 Matthew Potts yet to score.
England are desperate for another morale-boosting win after victory in the previous Test at Melbourne. Australia lead 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes.
It was the 22-year-old Bethell who kept their faint hopes alive after Zak Crawley fell early and first-innnings centurion Joe Root departed cheaply.
He powered to his hundred off 162 balls by smashing a lofted drive over midwicket for four.
“It’s pretty special, it’s not really sunk in yet. I haven’t really had time to kind of reflect on it,” Bethell told reporters.
Bethell had his parents in the stands and raised his bat towards them as he passed the milestone.
“To do that and have the family there was very special,” said the left-hander.
“My dad was a cricketer so he knows how it feels to be out there batting, but I don’t think that stops him from getting any less nervous.”
It was not just Bethell’s maiden Test ton but the only one he has scored in red-ball cricket, with his previous best 96 against New Zealand.
Bethell was recalled for Melbourne to replace the under-performing Ollie Pope, scoring a gritty 40 in difficult batting conditions.
He proved to be England’s rock, but soon saw wickets tumbling at the other end as Harry Brook was trapped lbw for 42 and Will Jacks caught without scoring in the space of three balls from part-time off-spinner Beau Webster.
“I certainly didn’t think I would (impact) with spin this game,” said Webster, who is more usually employed as a seamer, but returned figures of 3-51.
Webster believed the pitch had begun to take turn. “There was a bit of wear and tear there from Starcy’s footmarks,” he said. “And we managed to make the most of it in that session.”
‘Need to be smart’
A mix-up saw Jamie Smith run out for 24 just as he and Bethell were threatening to take the game away from Australia with a sixth-wicket partnership that had reached 45.
Ben Stokes then came in at number eight with the score 264-6 after limping off with groin injury while bowling, but the captain lasted only five balls.
Australia were dismissed for 567 before lunch on the back of Travis Head’s 163 and 138 from skipper Steve Smith, a first-innings lead of 183 runs.
England needed a solid start, but chief tormentor Mitchell Starc once again conjured up a first-over breakthrough – his 29th wicket for the series.
A beautiful inswinger was misjudged by Crawley who shouldered arms as it thudded into his pad and he was out lbw for one.
Fellow opener Ben Duckett was dropped on 38, but failed to capitalise and was bowled by Michael Neser on 42, his highest score in a wretched series.
Root, fresh from his first innings 160, was terrorised by Starc and Neser. He finally fell lbw after facing 37 balls for just six runs to the relentless Scott Boland.
Bethell knew he would now have to shepherd the tail on the fifth morning as England try to eke out a competitive target.
“I’m  going to have to be smart around how we let Pottsy and (Josh) Tongue come in and what they face,” said Bethell.
“But I’m just going to have to hit the gaps. It’s a big outfield, so there are plenty of gaps and I just have to try and hit them.”</p><small>2026-01-07 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071747579e75bcb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965637/un-accuses-israel-of-west-bank-apartheid' target='_blank'><strong>UN accuses Israel of West Bank ‘apartheid’</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations on Wednesday said decades-long discrimination and segregation of Palestinians by Israel in the West Bank were intensifying, and called on the country to end its “apartheid system”.
In a new report, slammed by Israel, the UN rights office said “systematic discrimination” against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had “drastically deteriorated” in recent years.
“There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

 

“Whether accessing water, school, rushing to hospital, visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives — every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel’s discriminatory laws, policies and practices,” he added.
“This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before.”
A number of independent experts affiliated with the UN have described the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories as “apartheid”, but this marks the first time a UN rights chief has applied the term.
Israel’s diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the report’s “absurd and distorted accusations of racial discrimination” against Israel, charging it exemplified the UN rights office’s “inherently politically driven fixation […] on vilifying Israel”.
Mounting settler violence
The report said the Israeli authorities “treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians residing in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, resulting in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues”.
“Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources,” it added.
This had led to “dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated”.
Turk demanded on Wednesday that Israel “repeal all laws, policies and practices that perpetuate systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion or ethnic origin”.
The discrimination was compounded by continuing and escalating settler violence, in many cases “with the acquiescence, support and participation of Israel’s security forces”, the rights office said.
More than 500,000 Israelis currently live in settlements in the West Bank, occupied since 1967 and home to around three million Palestinians.
Violence has risen in recent years, surging especially since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the Gaza conflict.
Since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry.
According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period.
‘Almost complete impunity’
Since Israel’s offensive in Gaza began, Israeli authorities had also “further expanded the use of unlawful force, arbitrary detention and torture”, the report said.
Increased “repression of civil society and undue restrictions on media freedoms (and) severe movement restrictions” had also characterised “an unprecedented deterioration of the human rights situation” in the West Bank, it said.
There had also been rapid expansions of settlements, considered illegal under international law, even as unlawful killings of Palestinians were taking place “with almost complete impunity”, the report warned.
Of the more than 1,500 killings of Palestinians that took place between the start of 2017 and September 30 last year, Israeli authorities had opened just 112 investigations, resulting in only one conviction, it pointed out.
The report said it had found “reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent […] to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians”.
This, it stressed, amounts to a violation of an international anti-racism convention, “which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid”.
The UN rights office on Wednesday urged Israel to end its “unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including by dismantling all settlements and evacuating all settlers, and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.</p><small>2026-01-07 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071306064e36b40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965624/hospital-sources-say-4-killed-in-airstrikes-on-yemen-separatist-leader-skips-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Hospital sources say 4 killed in airstrikes on Yemen; separatist leader skips talks</strong></a><br><p>At least four civilians were killed in coalition strikes in Yemen on Wednesday, two hospital sources told AFP, as the force raided the home province of a separatist leader who was kicked out of the presidency.
More than 15 airstrikes hit Dhale, the home governorate of Aidaros Alzubidi, whose Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month before seeing the advance rolled back by the coalition and forces.
“The initial toll from the strikes on the province of al-Dhale is four civilian deaths and six wounded,” medical sources at the Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP.
The coalition said it had given Aidaros Alzubidi a 48-hour ultimatum to come to Riyadh for discussions, after Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month.
But he failed to board the flight carrying his delegation, and the coalition struck his home province of al-Dhale after accusing him of mobilising “large forces” there.

 

Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), which holds executive power, then announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of high treason. The showdown between Yemen’s rival factions raised fears that second city Aden, where the STC insisted its leader was still located, could be drawn into the violence.
Alzubidi “fled to an unknown location … after he had distributed weapons and ammunition to dozens of elements inside Aden”, coalition spokesperson Major General Turki al-Maliki said in a statement.
The coalition carried out new strikes to prevent Alzubidi from “escalating the conflict” and extending it into Dhale governorate, he said.
An STC official told AFP that Alzubidi decided not to join the delegation flying to Saudi Arabia for talks after hearing he would be asked to dissolve his group, which forms part of the PLC.
Later, the STC said it had lost contact with the delegation following its arrival in Riyadh, urging Saudi Arabia to “guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh”.
Alzubidi “continues his duties” in Aden, the group said, calling on the coalition to halt the air strikes.
‘Grave crimes’
The PLC announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of committing several crimes, including “high treason” and “engaging in armed insurgency”.
“It has been established that [Alzubidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,” it said.
More than 100 people have been killed in the Yemeni coalition’s strikes on the separatists’ positions and in clashes on the ground.
The coalition and another group said it has asked STC deputy Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in Riyadh and approved Alzubidi’s dismissal from the presidency, to “enforce security and prevent hostilities in Aden”.
A security official in Aden told AFP that the forces loyal to Mahrami have been deployed in the streets and government buildings, including the presidential palace.
Aden is an STC stronghold and home to the group’s headquarters.
After Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014, it became the government’s self-proclaimed temporary capital.

 

As the civil war progressed, the STC’s political and military influence expanded across south Yemen and they became a dominant force in Aden.
Another security official told AFP that two days ago, the STC evacuated its headquarters in Aden and moved the operations of its TV channel to an unknown location for fear of bombing.
Last week, Alzubidi had announced a two-year transition towards creating a new country, “South Arabia”, in Yemen’s south.</p><small>2026-01-07 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643779-cm-afridi-urges-inclusion-of-kp-govt-in-anti-terror-policymaking' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi urges inclusion of KP govt in anti-terror policymaking</strong></a><br><p>

The agency registered an FIR against Shah on December 29, 2025, under Section 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person) and Section 24 (cyberstalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act, 2025.
Shah has done extensive coverage of Karachi’s water issues.
In the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Tabish Raza Husnain, the complainant, alleged that Shah was “doing defamation propaganda against me and my senior Col. Anjum in different Facebook WhatsApp groups and make false and baseless allegations on me”.
He also alleged that Shah used “abusive language which caused me significant distress and damage to my reputation”.
In the FIR, the NCCIA said that the complainant had submitted screenshots of the alleged content.
It further noted that during the inquiry, the agency issued multiple notices to the accused, “directing him to appear before it to record his statement and clarify his position”.
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under the controversial Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.
Last year, Farhan Mallick, the founder of the media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested on March 20 in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code. The following day, he was handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) custody for four days.</p><small>2026-01-07 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07163246b93a8d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.
India forced Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, prompting anger in Dhaka.
With ties tense between the two countries, Bangladesh wants the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.
The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.
Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told AFP today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.

 

A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.
The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.
The ICC has not commented.
Bangladesh international Mustafizur was snapped up at the IPL auction in December by the Kolkata Knight Riders for more than $1 million.
But he was let go on the Indian cricket board’s “advice” after what it called “recent developments”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.

 

India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071215403da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965621/social-media-posts-case-imaan-hadi-file-application-seeking-to-summon-dg-ispr-as-a-witness' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Imaan, Hadi file application seeking to summon DG ISPR as a witness</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, submitted an application in an Islamabad court on Wednesday seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in a case registered against them over their social media posts.
In the case, registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca), Mazari and Chattha have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On Wednesday, the two submitted a written application to Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka during the hearing of the case, referring to a press conference addressed by the military spokesperson on January 6.
The application said the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. During the press conference, “references were made to matters directly pending trial before this learned court”.
“This is the exact prosecution case that is pending adjudication before this learned court,” the application said.
Mazari and Chattha contended that their request was a “clear requisite of natural justice in line with the Constitutional protection safeguarded for the accused persons with respect to the right to fair trial and due process”.
The court subsequently directed that a copy of the application be provided to the prosecution and said a decision on the request would be made after it heard the prosecution.
Later, the court said it was issue a decision on the application after the statements of the accused were recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
During the proceedings, prosecution witness Shahroz Riaz was also cross-examined. He made several admissions regarding the manner in which the inquiry in the case was initiated and the collection of social media content.
The hearing has been adjourned till January 8.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643763-special-protection-unit-being-set-up-in-islamabad-for-chinese-citizens-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Special protection unit being set up in Islamabad for Chinese citizens: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>

According to a press release issued by the interior ministry, Naqvi made the remarks as he met China’s Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong in Beijing.
The two met at the headquarters of China’s Ministry of Public Security, where Naqvi received a warm welcome, the interior ministry said.
During the meeting, the leaders agreed to develop a joint and rapid response system against terrorism, including expanding training programs aimed at enhancing police capacity, it added.
Xiaohong lauded Pakistan’s efforts in countering terrorism and strengthening internal security, the statement said.
“We appreciate Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying.







During the meeting, “both ministers agreed on a joint strategy for training and enhancing the professional skills of police and security personnel”. They also vowed to maintain “an exchange of information between the police and other institutions of the two countries”.
Naqvi apprised the Chinese minister of the measures being taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, at which the latter expressed his satisfaction.
“The protection of Chinese citizens and projects of mutual interest remains our top priority,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He further said that “effective measures had been taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan”. He said that “a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals“.
Chinese citizens have come under attack multiple times in Pakistan, and according to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then.
The information was shared around a month after a security guard shot at two Chinese nationals in Karachi, leaving both of them injured.
In October that year, a bombing at the Karachi airport killed two Chinese engineers and left several others injured.
In July last year, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif said the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security.
He made the statement while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan, further highlighting that “the confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future”.
The PM also said that in light of the development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
Cooperation on prevention of cybercrime
The pair also discussed cooperation in the prevention of cybercrimes.
“Pakistan wants to benefit from the support of Chinese institutions to enhance the capacity of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA),“ the statement quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that Chinese-based AI technologies could be of “great help in countering terrorism and addressing security challenges”.
He said that Pakistan and China shared a bond based on “sustainable cooperation“. Naqvi expressed the desire to expand this cooperation further to tackle security challenges and protect mutual interests, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that the two sides will hold meetings of a joint working group every three months, while a meeting at a ministerial level will be held once a year.
Naqvi extended an invitation to the Chinese minister to visit Pakistan, and conveyed his best wishes to the Chinese president and prime minister on behalf of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Xiaohong also invited Naqvi to attend the Global Security Cooperation Forum — to be held in China in September, the statement added.
The Chinese minister expressed willingness to cooperate with Pakistan at all levels, stressing that “Pakistan and China are strategic partners”.
He also hosted a luncheon in honour of Naqvi and his delegation, the interior ministry said.</p><small>2026-01-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07073050f97daae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589/government-mulls-fuel-levy-hike-to-aid-gas-sector' target='_blank'><strong>Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector</strong></a><br><p>• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared to petrol and diesel which are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra had determined up to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan had concluded successful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.

 

Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

NEW DELHI: Although the government of Narendra Modi has persistently denied that the US played any role in mediating an end to the four-day India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam incident, a report in The Hindu details how a lobbying firm engaged by New Delhi made hectic calls to approach US officials on May 10, and beyond.
Although a filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) — including 60 entries made in December 2025 — did not divulge whether the calls on May 10 were made before or after the ceasefire, “they indicate close interaction on the day”, The Hindu wrote.
It said the embassy approached White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Ricky Gill at the National Security Council to discuss “media coverage” of the conflict.
This seems to contradict New Delhi’s stance, which has repeatedly denied several claims by US President Donald Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to award Mr Gill for the role he played in defusing the crisis.
In particular, the External Affairs Ministry consistently denied Trump’s contention he had threatened to stop trade if the conflict was not ended, and the call made to Mr Greer to discuss Operation Sindoor is particularly significant, the paper said.
The filings by US lobby firm SHW LLC raised eyebrows amongst diplomats in New Delhi as the firm also claimed that it set up meetings for several Indian officials — from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Deputy National Security Advisor Pavan Kapoor, and even Indian Ambassador Vinay Kwatra — with top Trump administration officials over the past year.
SHW LLC was contracted by the Indian Embassy on April 24, 2025. Dawn had previously reported on May 2 that former Trump aide Jason Miller’s firm had been engaged by New Delhi as a registered foreign agent for $150,000 per month.
It had no other clients over the year, according to the six FARA filings it made, and has been paid $900,000 in two quarterly instalments as part of an annual contract for $1.8 million.
The practice is a first, say former and current Indian officials, and indicates that rather than normal bilateral channels, the engagements — broadly over India-US trade ties and Operation Sindoor — were set up by the firm, led by former Trump spokesperson Miller, who is listed as the principal of SHW LLC.
While the embassy has always contracted two to three lobbyists at a time, to consult them on working with the Democrat and Republican parties, this is the first time a lobby firm has been asked to set up meetings with US officials, as also to schedule calls with government officials.
“Such meetings are routinely sought by the mission directly,” at least two Indian government officials told The Hindu.
“This seems to indicate that the Trump administration has set new rules of engagement and the government has been left with little choice but to play along,” a former diplomat, who had served at the Indian embassy previously, said.
“The Indian Embassy has hired such firms, consistent with local practice and requirements, under successive governments since the 1950s,” a spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said.
About the lobbying firm, The Hindu quoted another official as saying that lobbyists are hired “for advice and to understand the landscape, giving advice, and opening some doors,” but that meetings and calls are made between diplomats directly.
Apart from the calls on May 10, 2025, the firm billed the Embassy for making requests for the Parli­ame­ntary delegation led by Oppo­sition leader Shashi Tharoor to meet US Vice-President J.D. Vance and others.
On June 23, 2025, days before Mr. Jaishankar’s visit to Washington to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting, SHW says that it sent emails requesting meetings for the Minister with Mr. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA chief John Ratcliffe.
Of 60 entries detailing requests from the Indian Embassy, 30 reco­rded by SHW were requests for telephone calls to trade officials and White House senior officials to “discuss [the] status of US-India trade conversations”.
The calls increased in frequency as relations nosedived over US decisions to impose 25pc reciprocal tariffs and another 25pc in penalty tariffs for India’s oil procurement.
As tensions abated after Trump and Modi exchanged cordial words over social media, SHW said it made calls to White House officials to “flag social media post by Prime Minister Modi”.
Trump subsequently called Modi for his birthday on September 17, 2025, and the two leaders have spoken several times since then.

Speaking to reporters in Sukkur, Lanjar said a meeting was held wherein it was decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits that you see on social media,” he added.
Asked when the operation against the riverine dacoits was expected to begin, the minister replied, “You may consider that the operation has begun from today”.
Lanjar said dacoits would be “given a chance” to surrender before the courts. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them, there will be a fight, and they will get their just deserts,” he warned.
As per the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in Katcha Area of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, approved by the Sindh cabinet in October 2025, surrendering does not mean pardon or immunity.

 

All surrendering individuals shall face the prevailing law of the land, officials told Dawn, though voluntary surrender may be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing by courts.
The Sindh home minister appreciated the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation wherein a no-go Katcha area was vacated.
Responding to a question about whether the army’s help will be sought, Lanjar said, “The Sindh police is capable and the Rangers are with us in this, so I do not think we will need the army in our internal matters here.“
The minister further asserted that the required modern equipment will be provided to the personnel.
When a reporter mentioned that the dacoits employed drones, Lanjar said, “I do not think drones have reached them. Action is definitely being taken against their facilitators, too.”
On the possibility of a joint operation carried out by the Sindh and Punjab police, Lanjar said he has directed the Sindh inspector general to speak with his Punjab counterpart and the Bahawalpur regional police officer regarding the matter.

 

“This will surely happen only after a joint effort,” he stressed, noting that the area of Machka extends into Punjab. “I have strong hopes that we will wipe out these dacoits,” Lanjar said.
Asked about tribal disputes, the Sindh minister said this matter was also discussed in today’s meeting, and they had made the relevant contacts regarding the Jatoi-Mahar clash as well.
Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts.
On December 16, around 25 dacoits had attacked a bus near the Sindh-Punjab border and kidnapped 20 passengers after injuring the driver. The police recovered all the travellers unharmed the next day in a large operation.
When the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped at least 10 people from multiple vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5, 2025, it marked the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing M5 within Punjab’s limits.
As a safety measure, the police in Rahim Yar Khan later started running escorted night convoys on M-5 to protect motorists from dacoit gangs.
The Sindh and Punjab governments had vowed decisive action against the Katcha outlaws in August 2024, after a dozen policemen were martyred in a deadly attack by dacoits in the Machka area.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07132804e3c9081.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965625/contradiction-in-democracy-raza-rabbani-urges-na-speaker-senate-chairman-to-appoint-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>‘Contradiction in democracy’: Raza Rabbani urges NA speaker, Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani has called on the National Assembly (NA) speaker and Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders in both houses of Parliament, saying that leaving the posts vacant “sidelines dissent”.
The posts have been lying vacant since August last year, when then-opposition leaders in the NA and Senate — PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz — were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan following their conviction in cases related to riots on May 9, 2023.
The PTI has nominated Pakhtun­khwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader for the NA and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the Senate slot, but their notification remains pending.
Rabbani pointed out in a statement on Monday that “Parliament is incomplete”, adding that “this exposes a contradiction in our democracy”.
“We talk of the supremacy of Parliament, yet less inclined to uphold this principle,” he added.
Saying that the “political system is already strained by polarisation”, he said the NA speaker and Senate chairperson should, under the rules, appoint leaders of the opposition, “as leaving the offices vacant sidelines dissent”.
“Such steps go towards weakening Parliament, a self-made disaster in a hybrid democracy,” he asserted.
As far as the appointment of the opposition leader in the NA is concerned, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said on Monday that the process would be initiated afresh.
He said this during a meeting with PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, who called on him to discuss the unusual delay in the opposition leader’s appointment.
Sadiq told Dogar that the rules on the matter were clear.
For his part, Dogar presented documents confirming the withdrawal of cases involving former Ayub from the courts.
He also reiterated demand for Achakzai to be appointed as the opposition leader.
In response, Sadiq emphasised that all proceedings would be conducted strictly in accordance with rules, laws, and the Constitution. He said he would inform the House about this matter in the upcoming session of the National Assembly.
The development came around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub. The letter said the provision of details in writing was necessary for completing the process for appointing an opposition leader in the lower house of parliament.
Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC), but withdrew his plea in October last year, and the election on the seat that fell vacant due to his disqualification was also held and won by a PML-N candidate.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained that the matter related to appointment of a new opposition leader was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat had stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Dogar, the NA Speaker confirmed the receipt of documents pertaining to Ayub’s cases. Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of the decision.
“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said. He added the process would move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643721-imran-khan-meets-bushra-bibi-in-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan 'meets' Bushra Bibi in Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference.
It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism.
The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”.







The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities.
It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”.
It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI.
“This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families.
The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”.
The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions.
The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”.
“Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said.
It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”.
“The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said.
It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”.
“There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”.
“History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security.
“Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said.
KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI.
He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”.







“The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”.
“Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said.
He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”.
CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”.
“In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said.
He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace.
“If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked.
“Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added.
He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”.
“It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”.
“Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said.
He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed.
“It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added.
The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.</p><small>2026-01-07 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051118578fce5a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964293/how-ibne-safi-taught-an-entire-generation-to-read' target='_blank'><strong>How Ibne Safi taught an entire generation to read</strong></a><br><p>Karachi in the 1950s was not only a city under construction; it was a city learning how to read.
The years following Partition brought millions of migrants, anxieties and uncertainties to the port city. Together, they produced something: a wide public hungry for entertainment — gripping stories and dramatic narratives that could momentarily release readers from the grind of everyday survival.
Thus came about cheap print, serialised fiction, and an expanding entertainment economy, which created larger-than-life worlds for people struggling through daily precarity. It was in this environment that Asrar Ahmad — better known as Ibne Safi — emerged as one of the most widely read writers in the Urdu language.



His popularity is often described as a matter of talent alone. Certainly, he was a gifted stylist and storyteller. But literary brilliance does not, by itself, create a readership measured in the millions. Ibne Safi’s success partially rested on a deeper foundation: a whole publishing world that stretched back to colonial North India, reshaped in post-Partition Karachi, and oriented toward cultivating habits of regular reading, lawful conduct, and modern citizenship — ideals closely aligned with the nation’s aspirations at the time.
Seen this way, Ibne Safi was not merely writing spy stories; he was participating in the construction of a cultural market, and more importantly, a moral and civic imagination.
Building readers, not just writing books
One of the clearest signs that Ibne Safi wasn’t just spinning yarns comes from his paish lafz (prefaces). Addressing readers directly, he reassured newcomers that each novel in Jasusi Duniya was “complete” in itself, so that “new readers can start from any number without difficulty”. At the same time, he urged regular readers to place advance orders through local agents, warning that waiting until publication day might mean missing out altogether.
This was not an incidental authorial chatter, but rather a market discipline. By emphasising advance orders and serial continuity, Ibne Safi helped cultivate what economists would later call “repeat demand”. Readers learned to anticipate release dates, plan purchases, and treat fiction as a regular part of monthly life rather than an occasional indulgence.



These practices did not originate in Karachi. As literary historian Francesca Orsini argues, commercial Urdu publishing had already taken shape in late-colonial North India, where detective and mystery novels functioned as a full-fledged industry, complete with distribution networks, advertising strategies, and readers trained to expect regular instalments.
What Karachi inherited, then, was not simply a genre but a set of practices for producing readers on a large scale. What changed after Partition was the setting in which those practices now operated.
The city as mystery
With a mass readership, the question was no longer just about selling books, but about what those books helped people see. Here, spy fiction drew on a much older literary move in Urdu popular writing: the transformation of everyday urban life into a spectacle.
Writing about the late nineteenth century, literary scholar C. M. Naim traces how mistriz (mystery) and asrār (secret) novels began attaching suspense to recognisable places — Mistriz of Rawalpindi, Mistriz of Peshawar, Mistriz of Multan — so that readers could experience the thrill of danger not in some distant fantasy world, but in streets and cities that sounded real. That place-binding move, Naim suggests, produced what he calls a distinctly “sensational” atmosphere, where the everyday could be re-read as intrigue and risk rather than routine.
Francesca Orsini takes it a step further. She argues that this kind of storytelling wasn’t just about books — it was part of a bigger entertainment wave. Theatre, music, cinema — everything was about spectacle, suspense, and novelty. Audiences were being trained to seek spectacle, suspense, and novelty as part of modern city life. In other words, “sensational” reading was not just a literary taste; it was a social habit cultivated across multiple leisure industries.

 

Fast forward to Karachi of the 1950s, when those habits found a new metropolis, a new marketplace big enough to scale them. Pakistan’s film industry expanded rapidly — Urdu films released each year rose from five in 1949 to around 40 by 1960, per the Pakistan Film Magazine. Karachi’s entertainment economy was thriving, not only through cinema halls but also through the commercial ecosystems surrounding them.
It is telling, for instance, that Ibne Safi’s early publications were sent for sale to Regal Bookstore near Regal Cinema, linking the act of buying a spy novel to the city’s most visible engine of mass spectacle. Even the material form of these books moved in the same direction: publishers increasingly adopted colored cover designs. Ibne Safi’s covers became famous for their provocative, highly “sensational” imagery, featuring mysterious scenes, violent crimes, and often Western-looking femme-fatale figures that promised danger before a reader even turned the first page.



Seen this way, Ibne Safi’s fiction was not simply escapist reading that coincidentally became popular alongside films; it was part of a larger cultural production process — one that turned everyday experiences into commodities and trained readers to see the city as a legible field of secrets. His novels reimagined streets, offices, hotels, and clubs as places where plots could be hiding in plain sight. Karachi itself became a readable mystery.
And maybe that’s why these stories felt so comforting back then. Karachi was growing fast — it was chaotic, unfamiliar, a little unstable. But in Safi’s world, no matter how messy things got, someone could always figure it out. The answer was never magic — it was logic. Investigation, clues, and a sharp mind could bring order. The thrill wasn’t just the danger — it was the idea that even in the chaos of modern life, things could still make sense.
Language, legality, and literacy
In Pakistan’s nascent years, this was no small ambition. Independence coincided with the rapid expansion of centralised state power. Yet, legality itself remained fragile. Emergency powers, crimes, and coups meant that the law was present as an ideal and absent in practice.
It was precisely in this gap between law as promise and law as practice that detective fiction found its audience. Millions of readers encountered ideas about legality, evidence, and accountability not through courts or textbooks, but through popular novels sold at bookstalls and circulated through libraries. Spy fiction offered what might be called a vernacular legal education: it normalised investigation over vengeance, procedure over impulse, and reason over rumour. However spectacular the crime, Ibne Safi’s stories insisted on one thing: justice must be explained.
Critics have long noted this pattern. For example, literary scholar Christina Oesterheld argues that even when Ibne Safi wrote about state-level corruption, international crime syndicates, or criminalised institutions, his stories invariably resolved through logic rather than miracle. Disorder was never left mysterious. The pleasure lay not only in suspense, but in seeing chaos rendered intelligible.
Safi wasn’t shy about pushing proper Urdu either. He took the language seriously, sometimes almost too seriously. In one didactic piece, he joked that “those who did not know Urdu grammar were effectively blind, deaf, and crippled”. Hyperbole aside, the point aligned neatly with official thinking of the period.

 

From the 1950s onward, Pakistani policymakers — often working with international organisations — treated literacy not merely as a cultural good, but as a developmental necessity. “New literates” were expected to acquire not just reading skills, but disciplined habits: regular reading, library use, and linguistic standardisation.
Unesco reports from Karachi made this goal explicit. The challenge, they argued, was not teaching people to read once, but producing attractive material that would sustain reading over time. Cheap, serial, and engaging, popular fiction was perfectly suited to that task. It cultivated reading as a routine rather than an obligation.
Whether or not he meant to, Safi’s novels were doing quiet, meaningful developmental work. By making legality intelligible and reading habitual, his fiction reinforced the period’s development ethos.
A rupee well spent
Safi knew what he was doing — and he was proud of it. He often bragged that almost every Urdu reader in both Pakistan and India knew Jasusi Duniya, and that “in today’s world, there is no other language offering such interesting literature at such a low price”. For him, literary achievement rested on three things at once: reach, quality, and accessibility.
That claim was not mere self-promotion. It reflected the material realities of Karachi’s publishing market in the 1950s. Evidence from Pakistan’s National Bibliography shows that most books published by major houses during the first decade after independence were expensive — often priced well above one rupee.
In a city flooded with refugees struggling to secure housing and basic necessities, such books were luxuries. But Ibne Safi’s novels were consistently priced at around Rs1, even as page counts increased. In a market where price alone could determine whether a book was read or ignored, this difference mattered.

 

The structure of the industry helps explain why. A government report from the 1960s noted that Pakistan’s publishing sector remained small due to low literacy and weak purchasing power. To survive, publishers typically priced books at nearly three times their production cost, relying on high margins rather than high volume. Unsurprisingly, many gravitated toward textbook publishing, where demand was guaranteed by schools and state curricula. By 1960, roughly four-fifths of publishers and booksellers were involved in textbooks.
Ibne Safi, however, operated differently. As both author and publisher, he was not competing head-to-head with major literary houses, nor was he dependent on institutional buyers. His business model rested on scale: large readerships, quick turnover, and modest margins. Booksellers often marked up his novels precisely because demand was so strong. Affordability was not a by-product of popularity — it was a precondition for it.
The pattern becomes even clearer when looking across the broader market. Data on nearly two thousand literary titles published in West Pakistan between 1947 and 1961 reveal two consistent tendencies: first, books written in Urdu were significantly cheaper than books in other languages, and second, fiction was cheaper than non-fiction. That sweet spot — Urdu fiction — was where affordability and entertainment met. It’s no wonder it took off the way it did.
This pricing structure was not accidental. Urdu was being promoted as the national language for political and administrative efficiency, while popular culture — films, chapbooks, serialised novels — was increasingly organised around sensation and entertainment. Fiction benefited from both trends. It could be printed cheaply, sold widely, and circulated rapidly.
Affordability also depended on where and how books moved. Karachi’s publishing economy expanded rapidly during the 1950s, with capital and businesses concentrating in the city centre alongside cinemas, schools, and transport hubs. Yet official statistics tell only part of the story. A vast amount of reading material circulated through informal channels: chapbooks, pirated editions, and so-called “bazaar literature” that rarely appeared in state records. Unesco reports from the period acknowledged that these networks served as powerful mass distribution systems, drawing on older cultural traditions and dense personal ties.
Ibne Safi’s novels thrived in this environment. Their popularity spread beyond formal bookstores into informal markets, sometimes without royalties or authorisation. This counterfeit impulse undoubtedly hurt the author financially, but it also expanded his readership. Stories travelled faster than contracts. For many readers, especially those at the margins of the formal economy, these cheaper or copied editions were the only way to participate in the new reading culture.
Taken together, affordability and accessibility made his novels a social force, which allowed reading to become habitual rather than occasional. Students, clerks, muhajirs — people who were building new lives in a new city — found something familiar and exciting in those pages. A one-rupee book didn’t just pass the time; it created a shared experience and brought people into a common world of characters, clues, and conversation.
The making of the world of espionage
But beyond nostalgia, what does this tell us today?
First, it reminds us that a reading public is created. They require cheap formats, predictable circulation, and deliberate cultivation of habits. Ibne Safi did not simply respond to demand; he helped create it. Second, it shows that popular culture can perform civic work. Long before governance became a buzzword, detective fiction familiarised readers with law, evidence, and accountability. This did not fix institutions, but it shaped expectations about how authority ought to function.

 

Third, it highlights the political economy of language. Urdu’s centrality to Pakistan’s cultural life was reinforced not only by ideology, but by pricing, accessibility, and market scale. Finally, it poses an uncomfortable question for the present. As reading shifts from shared print cultures to fragmented digital feeds, what happens to the common habits that once anchored public life?
The Unesco language of “new literates” may sound dated, but the underlying concern remains urgent: if reading becomes a luxury, civic imagination shrinks.
Ibne Safi’s spies lived in the streets of Karachi because his readers did too. His stories offered a way to navigate modernity — its dangers, its rules, its promises — at a price ordinary people could afford.</p><small>2026-01-07 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643722-no-wonder-boy-coming' target='_blank'><strong>No 'wonder boy' coming</strong></a><br><p>

According to rescue officials, the incident occurred at around 2:15am early on Wednesday.
Chakwal Rescue 1122 spokesperson Qazi Muhammad Akram said the passenger bus was on its way from Rawalpindi to Bahawalpur.
As the motorway was closed due to fog, the driver opted for an alternative route and used the Talagang-Fatehjang Road, he said.
When the bus was passing by Dhoke Pathan village located on the bank of the Sowaan River, the driver lost control on a winding patch of road, the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said.
As a result, the bus plunged into a 100-foot-deep ravine, he said. Five passengers, including the bus driver, died at the spot while 24 others sustained injuries, he said.
He said that Rescue 1122 officials rushed to the scene after the incident was reported. He added that 15 officials and five emergency vehicles took part in the rescue operation which lasted for more than two hours.
Four of the deceased were identified as 56-year-old Abdul Sattar, the driver of the vehicle; 40-year-old Zia Ahmed from Kotli Sattiyan; 33-year-old Mohammad Ishaq from Lodhran; and 45-year-old Ramzan from Multan. The body of the fifth person has not yet been identified..
“We have taken the dead bodies to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Talagang while all the injured were taken to City Hospital Talagang,” District Rescue Officer Dr Mohammad Atique told Dawn.
He added that all the injured passengers were being examined at the hospital.
Meanwhile, Talagang Assistant Commissioner Suleman Mansha and Deputy Superintendent of Police Malik Azi visited the injured at City Hospital.
AC Mansha directed the hospital management to leave no stone unturned in treating the injured.
The incident comes days after another accident in Punjab, when over 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road on December 31, 2025. The death toll rose in the following days as more victims succumbed to their injuries, reaching 17 on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, authorities have closed several key motorways over traffic safety concerns due to dense fog in the province. Punjab Rescue 1122 said stated on Monday that it had responded to 1,081 road traffic crashes in the province during the previous 24 hours. These incidents claimed 24 lives and left 1,251 people injured, it said.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/070727365866baf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965604/trump-says-venezuela-turning-over-up-to-50m-barrels-of-oil-to-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Venezuela ‘turning over’ up to 50m barrels of oil to US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president.
The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.
Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.
The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend.
Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves.
Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post.







“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.

 

Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.
The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.
“Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said.
Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment.
Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US
US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US.
That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.
Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.
It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars.
Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion.
Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.
Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers
Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters.
Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.
This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said.
The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility.
Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’
US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela.
“Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News, when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports.
“With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.”
US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.
PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.
Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07102808fe06d64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965616/trump-discussing-how-to-acquire-greenland-us-military-always-an-option-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump discussing how to acquire Greenland, US military always an option: White House</strong></a><br><p>The White House said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the military, in a revival of his ambition to control the strategic island despite European objections.
Trump sees acquiring Greenland as a US national security priority necessary to “deter our adversaries in the Arctic region”, the White House said in a statement.
“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilising the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House said.
Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind the Arctic territory on Tuesday, saying it belongs to its people.

 

A US military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the Nato alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.
The strong opposition has not deterred Trump from reviewing how to make Greenland a US hub in an area where there is growing interest from Russia and China. Trump’s interest, initially voiced in 2019 during his first term in office, has been rekindled in recent days in the wake of the US arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Emboldened by Maduro’s capture last weekend, Trump has voiced his belief that American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again, and has put pressure on both Colombia and Cuba.
He has also started talking about Greenland again after putting it on the back burner for months.
A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Trump and his advisers are discussing a variety of ways to acquire Greenland.
Is Greenland for sale?
Those options include the outright US purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory, the official said. A COFA agreement would stop short of Trump’s ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the United States.
The official did not provide a potential purchase price.
“Diplomacy is always the presidents first option with anything, and dealmaking. He loves deals. So if a good deal can be struck to acquire Greenland, that would definitely be his first instinct,” the official said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that recent administration threats against Greenland did not signal an imminent invasion and that the goal is to buy the island from Denmark during a classified briefing late on Monday for congressional leaders, two sources familiar with the briefing said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Rubio’s comment.
Members of Congress, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, pushed back against the administration’s comments on Greenland, noting that Nato member Denmark has been a loyal US ally.
“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, the co-chairs of the Senate Nato Observer Group, said in a statement.
Administration officials say the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals important for high-tech and military applications. These resources remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and other challenges.
Its not going away, the official said about the president’s drive to acquire Greenland during his remaining three years in office.</p><small>2026-01-07 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0709202502baa22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965541/police-expand-scope-of-probe-into-suicide-bid-by-varsity-student-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Police expand scope of probe into suicide bid by varsity student in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police have expanded the scope of investigation into the case of a female student’s attempted suicide at a private university, following an earlier similar incident involving a male student.
The University of Lahore constituted a ‘high-level’ inquiry committee comprising senior faculty members and the management officers hours after a D. Pharmacy student attempted suicide by jumping from the second floor of the varsity building on Monday.
Fatima (21) was rushed to a local hospital with her both legs fractured badly and injuries to her other body parts. The police inquiries so far suggested that she took the extreme step following the pressure of her family to continue her studies in D. Pharmacy while she found it a tough subject. There were also reports that the student and her family had an heated argument on the same issue on Saturday last when she again raised the matter.
According to police officials, the student’s family has so far not submitted any application seeking legal action. Her statement could not be recorded due to the severity of her injuries.

Investigators record statements of family

Police said the student sustained serious injuries to her spine and lungs after jumping from the university building. All required medical tests have been repeated and investigators have also received information from her family.
Police have taken custody of CCTV footage from all cameras installed inside and around the university to establish the full sequence of events, which is currently being reviewed.
Police sources said action would be taken against the university administration if any negligence or lapse is established during the investigation.
Investigators said the student remained on a phone call for 27 minutes before jumping and had deleted the record of her last call.
Initial findings suggested that she arrived at the university in the morning but did not attend her class. She was reportedly upset after receiving 18 marks out of 35 in a test, a matter she had also discussed with her father and brother.
Police said further progress in the case would be made after recording the student’s statement.
Meanwhile, the injured student remains under treatment at Lahore General Hospital (LGH). The hospital administration confirmed that she has suffered a head injury and fractures to her back and knee.

 

On Tuesday, Higher Education Department (HED) Secretary Ghulam Farid Kathia visited LGH and inquired after the student. Medical Superintendent Dr Faryad Hussain briefed him on her medical condition.
During a media briefing, Ameeruddin Medical College Principal Prof Farooq Afzal said the student’s condition has improved but the next 48 hours are critical.A special medical board, headed by Prof Jodat Saleem, has been formed comprising specialists from neurosurgery, surgery, orthopaedics, pulmonology and gynaecology.
Prof Jodat Saleem said the patient was in shock on arrival and had lost significant blood. Doctors administered two units of blood and successfully stabilised her condition.
He said the patient’s response to treatment has improved and medical care is continuing.

In a video posted by Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X, Imran’s sister Aleema said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had informed them that a meeting would be arranged next week.
Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party.
“This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday.







“Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said.
Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water.
In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters.
However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week.
“Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration.







She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir.







For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws.
He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting.







He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest.
“If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said.
“If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said.







On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site.
The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order.
The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum.
It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.</p><small>2026-01-07 03:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07074621ed2b65e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965591/arrest-warrants-out-against-pti-leaders-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Arrest warrants out against PTI leaders in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for more than 40 PTI leaders over their absence in the case concerning the May 9 protest outside the GHQ.
The case was heard by Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Amjad Ali Shah. During the proceedings, defence lawyers sought the court’s permission to meet Mr Khan at Adiala Jail, stating that access was necessary to obtain instructions regarding the pending cases.
Defence counsel told the court that they had alre­ady taken instructions from the PTI founder in connection with the cases, reiterating that effective legal represen­tation requi­red direct consultation with their client.
Opposing the request, the special prosecutor submitted that Mr Khan was on bail in the May 9 GHQ attack case and was not in the custody of the ATC. He further informed the court that the PTI founder had since been convicted in ano­t­h­er case, adding that the defence could appro­ach the relevant forum if it had any grievance regarding access.
The prosecutor mainta­ined that, as a convicted pri­s­oner, the PTI founder was in the custody of the jail sup­e­r­intendent and that, under the law, jail aut­hori­ties had the power to regulate meetings. He argued that the issue rai­s­ed by the defence did not fall within the jurisdiction of the ATC hearing the GHQ attack case.
In response, the defence counsel adopted a firm position, stating that until they were granted access to the PTI founder, they would not be a part of the court proceedings. During the hearing, the court also took notice of the absence of several accused and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 40 to 45 accused who failed to appear.
Trial via video link
The court provided defence lawyers with a copy of the Punjab government’s notification regarding the conduct of the trial through a video link. According to the notification issued on October 30 last year, proceedings in the May 9 GHQ attack case are to be conducted via video link.

 

Later, the court adjourned the hearing until January 20.
Separately, the hearing of the Judicial Complex attack case against the PTI founder and other accused in the Anti-Terrorism Court, Islamabad, was adjourned without proceedings due to the unavailability of Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra. The court fixed the next date of hearing for February 6.
Similarly, the hearing of another case registered at the Secretariat Police Station was also adjourned without proceedings owing to the judge’s absence. As a result, statements of witnesses could not be recorded, and the next hearing was fixed for January 12.

According to a navy statement, PNS Behr Masah has been deployed in support of this scientific mission, which is being conducted by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in collaboration with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography.
According to NHO, the Behr Masah is a hydrographic survey ship with the capability to undertake oceanographic and geo-physical surveys. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the navy underscored its commitment to promoting maritime awareness and facilitate marine scientific research in Pakistan.

Exercise aimed at improving understanding of Pakistani marine environment

The Joint Oceanographic Cruise represents a significant scientific collaboration between Pakistan and China, aimed at enhanced understanding of the marine environment in Pakistani waters. 
The research outcomes are expected to increase awareness of coastal and offshore marine dynamics, enabling better assessment of environmental patterns and supporting informed maritime planning and policymaking.
According to the NIO, the signing ceremony of the ‘Letter of Agreement on China-Pakistan Joint Cruises for Marine Environment and Ecosystem in Pakistan Coastal Area’ was held in Hangzhou, China, on Dec 12, 2025.
The NIO initiated the joint marine cruises with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography for the collection of marine environmental and ecosystem data across all four seasons in Pakistan’s coastal areas.
This will be an opportunity for senior representatives of both institutions to collaborate on marine ecosystems, coastal dynamics, climate change, and the sustainable utilisation of ocean resources. It will be a shared commitment to scientific cooperation, data exchange, joint research initiatives and capacity building.
Through this initiative, Pakistani scientists will have the opportunity to analyse samples in Chinese laboratories, which is not possible in Pakistan due to the lack of expensive laboratory equipment and machines. Pakistani personnel will also have opportunities for training on ocean equipment innovation, equipment operation, data collection techniques on board, and post-cruise laboratory analysis.
