PAKISTAN was born into long-term hostility with its neighbour, India. Security was, accordingly, key to avoiding the peril of infant-nation mortality. Later, it needed to broaden its strategy to good governance including democracy, economic and human development, and rights protections. The Quaid departed before this essential transition could commence. The process has been aborted ever since despite fleeting periods of promise. The result has been the loss of the majority of Pakistan’s original population within its first 25 years, and no lessons learned during the next half century to ensure the viability of what was left of the country.
Praetorian elite capture has been primarily responsible for this tragedy. Undoing it will need a ‘whole of the nation’ undertaking. What needs to be done in terms of policies and institution building over a whole range of national endeavours is largely known. But the likelihood of much of it happening appears non-existent today because of the perversity of the prevailing political and power structures. Moreover, this grim prospect is being progressively internalised by ruling elites and the middle class intelligentsia whose attitudes and choices determine the fate of nations. A refusal to accept these realities is itself a form of complicity. The only view that is worse is the assumption that the nation will somehow survive, despite its wretched condition, because its nuclear weapons status guarantees the rest of the world has a stake in its survival!
 
 

This is the national context in which our Afgh­a­n­­istan policy should be considered. The Afghan people have a historical relationship with the people of Pakistan. Had the British adopted the Forw­ard Policy instead of Lawrence’s Non-interference Policy there may have been no Afghanistan today as the British and Russian Empires would have met along the Amu Darya instead of being separated by Afghanistan — which has since developed into a resilient nation. This is due to the wisdom and moderation of its rulers — with recent exceptions which have been the result of Russian and American invasions. Nevertheless, its ethnically diverse peoples have embraced their collective Afghan identity despite their rivalries.
Pakistan got off to a poor start in its relations with Afghanistan because of reasons most supposedly educated and informed Pakistanis know little about. The British drew the Durand Line after the Second Afghan War lopping off sizeable portions of Afghan territory and incorporating them into British India while acknowledging Ka­­bul’s continued interest in its lost peoples. Af­­ghanistan never formally recognised the legitimacy of a border forcibly demarcated by imperial aggression.

Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan, Pakistan should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity.

This led to its vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations, which it quickly reversed after making its legally dubious but historically and politically understandable point. Afghanistan realised the Pakhtun of the NWFP and Balochistan, after a century of living with fellow Muslims under British rule, preferred to become part of Pakistan while simultaneously owning an indissoluble kinship with their Afghan brethren. Later, the so-called Pakhtunistan issue arose which Afghan governments exploited for domestic political purposes (and also to counter Pakistan’s transit trade leverage) just as successive governments in Pakistan have often used the internationally recognised Kashmir dispute for domestic political purposes.
Nevertheless, two facts are incontrovertible: in practice, Kabul has treated the Durand Line as an international border, and during Pakistan’s several conflicts with India it has never had to worry about its western border. Moreover, Kabul has consistently acknowledged its debt to Pakistan for its critical assistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Even so, the Afghans pride themselves on resisting the mighty powers of the past and the present and, accordingly, resent Pakistan’s perceived attempts to impose ‘friendly governments’ in Kabul and control its foreign policy, especially towards India. They blame Pakistan for imposing Pakistan-based mujahideen and subsequently mediaeval Taliban rule in Afghanistan which has isolated it from the contemporary world, including Muslim countries. Both endeavours proved counterproductive for Pakistan but ruinous for Afghanistan. As a result, Pakistan has no friends in Afghanistan today.
 
 

As for the TTP, the Afghans insist the overwhelming majority of its attacks originate from within Pakistan. Many in Pakistan concede there is a measure of truth in this allegation. Pakistan is, accordingly, following self-defeating Afghan and strategic policies. They are driving Afghanistan into the arms of India and setting up a dangerous ‘nutcracker’ (two-front) situation for itself just to distract domestic political attention from the grim state of affairs in the country. Despite Pakistan’s admirable performance in the recent conflict with India this situation is straining its domestic stability. Instead of a Big Brother policy towards Afghanistan it should consider a policy of Strategic Generosity much like the enlightened policy of Brazil towards its smaller neighbours — and indeed of China towards the Global South. In that case, the Durand Line would eventually evolve into a regular border that is fully recognised and respected by Afghanistan.
Such a far-sighted policy could go a long way towards recouping the irreparable loss of East Pakistan by finessing the current strategy of India towards Pakistan, and conceivably embarking upon the historic task of laying the foundations for a possible confederation with Afghanis­tan that would comprise approximately 300 million people. Progress in this endeavour could facilitate far broader and deeper strategic cooperation with China, Iran and Central Asia and effectively counter India’s hegemonic ambitions.
Countless challenges will lie in the path of such a historic endeavour that would answer to the vi­­sion of Allama Iqbal. But imagination, goodwill and persistence can render the seemingly impossible, possible. There is an affinity between the peo­ple of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which shou­­ld easily accommodate Pakhtun cross-border kinship. There is no room here for essential details. But if we truly rather than merely ritually believe in our future we should seriously explore such pos­­sibilities that are in fact survival imperatives.

Published in Dawn, November 5th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-05 03:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953274/knives-out' target='_blank'><strong>Knives out</strong></a><br><p>THE 18th Amendment has been a thorn in the side of certain quarters within the state, especially those that desire greater control over its meagre resources. Now, with clear signals that a 27th amendment is being pushed forward, it seems the 18th Amendment may finally end up on the chopping block.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, revealing that the prime minister has sought his party’s support for the amendment, has stated that the subjects of education and population planning have been sought to be returned to the federation. This would mean a significant rollback of the powers delegated to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
 
 

Not only that, the safeguards for provincial shares in state revenues under the National Finance Commission Award are also to be done away with. The judiciary is also in the crosshairs, with plans to set up constitutional courts, restore executive magistrates and more tightly control the transfer of judges.
It is remarkable that the PPP has been approached for its consent. After all, the 18th Amendment was a major achievement for the party and its co-chairman, incumbent President Asif Ali Zardari. The president and his party are being expected to give up the crowning glory of their political contributions in recent memory.
 


Seen in that context, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s surprise post on X may have simply been a call for attention. After all, the pressure to get the amendment done must be immense, considering the stakeholders involved. However, it is important that the PPP hold the line. The 18th Amendment may have created new sets of problems, and its lofty ambitions might have failed to materialise, but the legislation was also a shining example of what broad political consensus can achieve. It may be recalled that both the treasury and opposition benches of that time had played central roles in its enactment.
To see that achievement undone would be no less than a political tragedy. It must also be said that one cannot help but view the 27th amendment with a wary eye, especially after how matters developed following the 26th. In that case, too, it was argued by the ruling parties that the amendment would do much good to the country. The outcomes have been anything but. The fundamental problem remains that the current legislature is wanting in legitimacy and credibility.
It is no wonder that its repeated attempts to rewrite the Constitution invite deep misgivings and trigger even more discontent, especially among the masses who feel that they have been systematically sidelined by the current regime. The Constitution states that the public will reigns supreme. If there is any deference left for the document, the ruling parties must desist from proceeding on further amendments to the Constitution till public and political consensus can be reached.

According to CBS, Mamdani received 677,615 votes (49.6 per cent) against 568,488 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 108,377 (7.9pc) for Curtis Sliwa.
Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party.
Trump had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“.
Mamdani was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018.
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race.
The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.
Since US President Donald Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness.
Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot.
“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US
Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday. Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival.
Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary.
A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign.
Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics.
Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office.
Democrat Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor.
A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses.
Spanberger, 47, centered her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message.
“We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.”
“You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most  lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said.
Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms.</p><small>2025-11-05 03:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/050819008e354e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953218/ppp-stalwarts-wary-of-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PPP stalwarts wary of 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>• PPP Sindh president says unilateral changes to Constitution not acceptable, throws weight behind 18th Amendment
• Rabbani says recalling the financial devolution against scheme of participatory federalism
• PTI leader calls for consensus before any constitutional tweaks, says it’s akin to abolishing Constitution; JI chief warns against its ramifications for judiciary
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: After the government approached the PPP to seek its support for the 27th Ame­ndment, the key party leaders have come out against the proposed constitutional tweaks that are said to be an attempt to roll back the landmark 18th Amendment that ensured provincial autonomy.
The opposition to the proposal came as the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) is set to meet on November 6 to review the government proposal after a PML-N delegation led by the prime minister had sought the party’s support for the proposed 27th Amendment.
 
 

The early indications suggest that backing the move may not be easy for the party, as dissenting voices have already begun to surface from within its own ranks. Senator Raza Rabbani feared that the wrapping up of the 18th Amendment would lead to extraconstitutional activities in the country.
In a statement, Senator Rabbani said the proposed constitutional amen­dments of the government, with reference to provincial autonomy, amount to a rollback of the 18th Amendment.
“In the brittle internal political situation, playing with provincial autonomy will cast deep shadows over the federation,” he said, adding, “The 18th Amendment disarmed the extreme nationalists of a political discourse; such an amendment will lend vigour to their extra-constitutional activities.”
Mr Rabbani said that revisiting devolved ministries will be a financial burden on the federal government. Recalling the financial devolution, he said, will be against the scheme of participatory federalism.
“If the federal government is unable to manage its finances, then let the provinces collect all the taxes and look after federal expenditures through the Council of Common Interests,” he added.
Nisar Khuhro, the president of the PPP’s Sindh chapter, made it clear that “the party firmly opposes any attempt to roll back the 18th Consti­tutional Amendment”.
“Unilateral changes to the Consti­tution would not be acceptable,” he said while addressing a press conference in Karachi. “The 18th Amendment was passed unanimously through consensus among all political parties after deliberations by a national committee — a consensus that even dictators could not undo. The PPP is categorically against any rollback of the 18th Amendment.”
Mr Khuhro said the matter would be taken up in detail at the PPP’s CEC meeting, where the party would decide its final position on the issue. Meanwhile, PTI leaders alleged that the details of the 27th Amendment, shared by the PPP chairman, were similar to abolishing the Constitution.
“Although we will give a formal response…after meeting founding chairman Imran Khan and discussing it in the meeting of the political committee, I suggest the amendment should be made with consensus in light of the current situation in Pakistan,” Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told reporters outside Adiala.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman criticising the proposed amendment said these moves were aimed at establishing governmental control over the judiciary.
Addressing a press conference, he said that the 26th Constitutional Amen­­dment gave a serious blow to the judiciary, whereas the proposed 27th Amendment was aimed at establishing the executive’s dominance over courts.

• Discrepancy arises from reliance on administrative boundaries over population density, settlement patterns
ISLAMABAD: An analysis of a World Bank policy research working paper reveals that Pakistan’s true level of urbanisation is close to 88 per cent, based on satellite imagery and the Degree of Urbanisation methodology.
According to the working paper titled “When Does a Village Become a Town?: Revisiting Pakistan’s Urbanisation Using Satellite Data”, the substantial discrepancy arises from Pakistan’s reliance on administrative boundaries that fail to reflect actual population density or settlement patterns.
The analysis finds that Pakistan’s urban population is nearly twice the size reported in official statistics, as the administrative definition accounts only for the largest cities. Based on the DoU classification, 88pc of the population lives in an area with urban characteristics – 46pc in high-density cities and about 42pc in moderately dense urban centres.
These figures contrast sharply with the 39pc urban population reported in official data, revealing a major gap between politically defined and technically measured classifications.
The findings indicate that secondary cities and peri-urban areas — rather than megacities — are the primary drivers of recent urban expansion and are systematically overlooked in official classifications. This discrepancy between functional and administrative classifications has significant fiscal and planning implications.
 
 

Misclassified areas reduce property tax revenues and undermine the planning and delivery of essential public services. Moreover, misclassification distorts spatial socioeconomic indicators, masking the true extent of urban-rural disparities and complicating the design of effective, evidence-based public policy, according to the research paper produced by the World Bank’s Office of the Poverty and Equity Global Department.
The last time Pakistan’s official classification of urban areas reflected on-the-ground realities was in 1972. Before then, urban classification was based on objective indicators such as population count, infrastructure, and public service provision. However, after 1972, the responsibility shifted to provincial and municipal committees, which have no formal obligation to consider population concentration or objective metrics when defining urban areas – nor are they required to periodically revise urban boundaries.
The study shows that while official statistics suggest 39pc of Pakistan’s population is urban, this figure rises to 88pc when population density and concentration are considered. The official definition captures only the largest urban centres and fails to recognise the urban character of growing peri-urban areas that now host nearly half the population.
Additionally, the paper discussed how mirroring the urban expansion of Pakistan with the development of “megacities” overlooks the significant urbanisation occurring in growing peri-urban areas. While the expansion of cities like Lahore and Karachi is a notable indicator of the country’s increasing urbanisation, a large part of the urban population growth occurs in many intermediate and small urban centres.
The study uses the Degree of Urbanisation method, which relies on satellite data to assess population density, providing a more accurate and globally comparable view of urbanisation beyond administrative boundaries.
Across all provinces, the divergence between the official urban classification and the DoU persists, with official statistics consistently
Official data underrepresents urbanisation, with Islamabad showing only 47pc urban population compared to 90pc under the DoU, while figures in Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh are more closely aligned.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the DoU estimates the urban population at nearly three times the official 15pc, while Islamabad is mostly dense urban, and other provinces show mixed suburban and peri-urban growth.  The report concludes that Pakistan’s urban landscape has transformed dramatically over the past two decades. Since the early 2000s, a growing share of the rural population has shifted away from agriculture, transforming previously rural settlements into new and vibrant urban centres.

Under the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), publication of the IMF-prepared GCD report and a subsequent action plan to address governance weaknesses across federal and provincial tiers is a key structural benchmark.
The deadline, initially end-July and then reset to end-August and end-October 2025, remains unmet owing mainly to technical and factual disagreements between Pakistani authorities and the IMF team.
“We have reaffirmed the structural benchmark and, with mutual understan­ding with the IMF, have committed to publish the report before the [IMF exe­­­c­utive] board meeting” later this mo­nth or early next month, an official said.

Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment is a structural benchmark under $7bn bailout package

He said it was a very comprehensive exercise conducted by the technical and legal teams of the IMF in consultation with other global organisations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Drafts were exchanged repeatedly with Pakistani counterparts — including anti-corruption bodies, the superior judiciary, investigation agencies and the finance and law ministries — to secure “the best outcome” from international expertise covering more than 100 rules, the official added.
He said there had been serious disagreements on the interpretation of rules in the local and internal context, “for the best advice and implementation plan”. The official claimed the disagreement phase was now over and a final draft had been shared with IMF headquarters in Washington for a final review before publication.
The two sides are believed to have discussed reducing the time gap betw­een the publication of the GCD Asses­sment Report and a resultant governance action plan based on its recommendations for reform measures to address critical governance vulnerabilities.
Earlier, the GCD report was set for publication in July and the action plan rollout was scheduled for a gap of three months by the end of October. The latter may now be rolled out before December to become subject for the next biannual review.
There are compliance gaps around asset declarations by public servants. While the overarching civil servants’ law has been amended to mandate electronic filing by Grade-17 and above officials, including beneficially owned assets and those of family members, for access by relevant institutions, tax authorities and banks, implementation remains uneven.
An IMF scoping mission had visited Pakistan early this year and held meetings at the Supreme Court, the Law and Justice Division, the Auditor General for Pakistan, parliamentarians, the National Accountability Bureau, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the State Bank of Pakistan.
It produced a comprehensive report identifying gaps and weaknesses in public finance management, FBR’s tax system, and the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues’ efforts to identify loopholes.
Under the existing governance mechanism, the majority of government officers have not been disclosing assets of their own and those of other family members to the tax authorities or the Establishment Division, and there was an insufficient institutional mechanism for accountability.
On top of that, many institutions, including regulatory bodies, have exemptions from such requirements of scrutiny and disclosures. No wonder there have been widespread reports of corruption and corrupt practices across the bureaucratic and political landscape, and Pakistan has been ranking high on the various international corruption perception indexes.
 
 

The IMF has been pressing for data-based red flags, due diligence, safeguard mechanisms and guidelines against corruption and misuse of public offices, resulting in sub-optimal decision-making and compromising the country’s business and growth potential. The Paris-based FATF had also identified a series of weaknesses and made recommendations for course correction.
Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the second review of $7bn bailout package and the first review of $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Fund (RSF) on Oct 14.
Under the agreement, Pakistan will get $1bn disbursement under the EFF and $200m under RSF upon approval of the IMF executive board. The board meeting has not been announced yet, but authorities suggest this would be convened any time after Nov 15.

The PPP and PML-N, in separate meetings, had earlier decided to part ways with the coalition government and sought approval from their respe­ctive leaderships to withdraw ahead of the upcoming general elections.
After several rounds of deliberations and shifting positions, the PML-N eventually announced it would support the PPP in forming its own government but would not accept any share in the new set-up.
Meanwhile, a series of meetings of PPP legislators and senior leaders were held in Karachi and Islamabad to chalk out a strategy.

PPP law minister defends use of official perks, says they can be availed until vote of confidence

During one such meeting, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari categorically declared that his party would oust the incumbent AJK premier and replace him with a loyalist from within the party.
Under Article 18 of the AJK Constitution, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence against the prime minister must be moved by at least 14 members — constituting 25 per cent of the total strength of the assembly — and must include the name of the proposed successor.
Subsequently, at least 10 members from the so-called ‘forward bloc’ of PTI dissidents also announced their support for the PPP’s planned move, enabling the party to meet the minimum requirement of 27 votes needed to topple the government.
Nevertheless, the PPP leadership remained insistent on securing PML-N’s backing to ensure a comfortable and unchallenged majority. Following the understanding between the two parties, a draft of the no-confidence motion against Mr Haq was prepared and signed by over 14 legislators, including two from the PML-N.
Yet, nearly three weeks later, the PPP has failed to finalise the name of its candidate for the premiership, leaving the move hanging in the balance.
‘Forward bloc’ irony
Ironically, despite publicly announcing their intent to unseat the prime minister, none of the PPP or PML-N ministers have resigned from their positions or relinquished official privileges.
One cabinet member from the PML-N, who was seen accompanying his party’s senior anti-Haq leadership at one meeting, also chaired a meeting himself and released pictures from it to the media.
Of the 10 ‘forward bloc’ members, three — representing Pakistan-based refugee constituencies — had announced their resignations from the cabinet, but the same had not been accepted by the prime minister. Despite their declared dissociation, the trio also continued to enjoy official perks and privileges.
Adding to the irony, most of the ‘disgruntled’ ministers have been camped in the federal capital for weeks, engaging in slow-paced negotiations and power-sharing discussions over the formation of the next government.
Political sources claim that the tabling of the motion may take another four to five days, effectively giving more time to an embattled prime minister who has virtually lost the confidence of the assembly’s majority.
Hurried approval of schemes
Taking advantage of the situation, the incumbent premier — who had preferred to spend much of his time in Islamabad during the previous two and a half years of his rule — has unusually stationed himself in Muzaffarabad for the past 12 days, where he has been issuing directives and granting administrative approvals on files that had remained pending in his office for several months.
On October 27, he sanctioned six schemes in the energy sector worth over Rs2.68 billion — four of them worth Rs1.4bn for his home district alone. The same day, he approved releases of funds to different departments for the first half of the current fiscal year, amounting Rs3.72bn. However, the approval was withdrawn by the additional chief secretary for development the following day.
In a pointed reference to the situation, the PM’s electoral rival and PML-N Secretary General Chaudhry Tariq Farooq took to social media, expressing his surprise that the ministers who had inked out their signatures on the no-confidence resolution were still holding their portfolios and using official resources.
“Since September, AJK has been in a state of political crisis. Although the motion has not yet been formally tabled, it is astonishing that those ministers who have openly declared their intention to support it continue to remain part of the cabinet. The use of official resources and privileges goes on unabated. Good governance remains “untarnished,” and the cloak of austerity has not even been pierced. What a fixed match — and everyone knows it,” he wrote on X.
The usage of the term ‘good governance’ is actually a reference to the AJK PM, with the phrase being used ironically.
“People across AJK are both surprised and saddened by the political farce,” Mr Farooq added.
However, when PPP legislator Mian Abdul Waheed, who still holds the office of law minister in the Haq-led government, was asked by a reporter if it was unethical for cabinet members seeking to dislodge the prime minister to use official transport, he defended it.
“The day the no-confidence motion is tabled and fails, it would become morally, legally and constitutionally impermissible — absolutely haram — for us to retain these official vehicles. Until the motion is actually presented, however, there is nothing written anywhere that bars us from using them.”

Mr Dar’s remarks came amid a sustained protest by opposition senators over the delay in appointing the leader of the opposition. He said that after the PPP, the government would take all allies on board, including the MQM, ANP, IPP and BAP. “A standard process is being followed,” he said.
The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate.
Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority.
‘Conspiracy against Constitution’
Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works.
“This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate.
“Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said.
Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”.
He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission.
However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains.
The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control.
“All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.”
He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution.
“The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?”
He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment.
The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter.
The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.”
Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak.
Asaan Karobar Bill
Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements.
Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.
The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment.
According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.”
The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.”
The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.

Officials said nearly two dozen armed men, carrying heavy weapons, attacked the Khattan Police Station in Kachhi district. The station had been recently established in a building of the Livestock Department and handed to the police after the merger of levies personnel into police.
The assailants entered the two-room police station, burning official records and furniture. They also took away two rifles, including an SMG and a G-3, along with a mobile phone and a private motorcycle before fleeing.
“Owing to the large number of assailants, the former levies personnel, who were in a nearby private house, could not effectively respond,” a senior official said, adding that no loss of life or injury was reported.
Local police and security forces reached the site soon after receiving information about the incident and launched a joint search operation to trace the attackers. The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Sibi Range is further investigating the case.
Check post attacked 
Meanwhile, unidentified men attacked a security forces check post in Western Bypass area of Quetta with hand grenades. “The motorcyclists fired two grenades at the post, which exploded close by but caused no casualties,” police officials said.
Security personnel deployed at the post retaliated with fire; however, the attackers managed to escape after hurling the grenades. Security forces later launched a search operation in the area.

Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir issued the directive while hearing a petition related to the X account operated in Imran Khan’s name. The court also instructed the Deputy Attorney General and the state counsel to immediately convey the order to the jail administration through a phone call. 
A two-page written order was later released, directing the Addi­tional  Attorney General to inform the Adiala jail superintendent about the  court’s instructions. 
During the hearing, Advocate Raja informed the court that des­pite repeated court orders over the past several months, he had not been allowed to meet his client. He argued that without consulting the PTI founder, he could not respond effectively to the petition. “I need to sit and take instructions from the founder of PTI,” he said.

Aleema vows to continue struggle for her brother even if jailed

Justice Arbab Tahir remarked that the court had already permitted such meetings and questioned whether the counsel had received the written order of the larger bench. Mr Raja said that although an application for the copy had been made, it was not provided.
The court then reiterated that the jail authorities must ensure the meeting takes place on Monday and that the order be communicated to the concerned officials without delay. 
Aleema’s media talk 
Following the proceedings, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khan spoke to the media outside the court, vowing to continue the legal and political struggle for the PTI founder’s rel­ea­­se. “We will keep fighting for Imran Khan. You may jail us, but we will not abandon this cause,” she said, adding that the authorities’ actions reflected “fear of Imran Khan.”
Advocate Raja, while talking to reporters, said a citizen had filed a petition seeking deletion of tweets attributed to the PTI founder and a ban on sharing “anti-state” content through his X account.

“We are always keeping an eye on whatever is happening around us. We are always monitoring what is happening. This is an ongoing thing, our monitoring and our readiness,” he told the media on the second day of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference 2025 (PIMEC-25) at the Expo Centre.
He said that Pakistan would soon induct new submarines into its fleet, which will significantly contribute to national and maritime security. 
“Pakistan Navy’s  role in the region is to ensure maritime security and the free flow of  trade in the region. The new submarines will significantly contribute to  that in the coming days,” he said. 

Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz pins hopes on Gwadar port

Talking about PIMEC, he termed it an effort to provide stimulus to Pakistan’s maritime sector and blue economy. 
The vice admiral said that there were some maritime industries that were “less visible and less known”. 
He also stressed the need for efficient port operations and hoped to see Gwadar Port fully functional soon. 
“Your turnaround port time, and the size of ships that can dock there, matters, like our deep water terminal in Karachi where we can dock big ships. Gwadar is at such a strategic location that it will help significantly in transshipment and seaborne trade. A fully functional Gwadar Port will present us with huge economic opportunities in the future,” he said.
The Karachi Shipyard also has a huge presence at PIMEC-25. While speaking about it, the Vice Admiral reminded that it was built ages ago and, therefore, has a limit to the kind of ships being built there. 
“The world has moved on. Shipyards in the world today are huge. We are also trying to build a shipyard on those lines in Gwadar. We hope to progress there. There was also a discussion about building a shipyard in Port Qasim. So yes, I think we need to have more shipyards. And the sooner the better,” he said.

The ministry’s focal person, Ghulam Mustafa Malik, told Dawn that Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain called the move “unacceptable”.
“Federal Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain has expressed reservations and said that no such decision will be accepted that will cause difficulties for overseas Pakistanis in travel,” Malik said.
“Although human trafficking is a big problem, it would be appropriate to avoid any move that would cause travel difficulties for overseas Pakistanis and the workforce going abroad for employment.”
Malik stated that the ministry has sent a clear message that the government is serious about protecting citizens’ fundamental rights and that no institution “will be allowed to impose unnecessary restrictions on public freedoms”.
“Now all Pakistanis who have a valid Protector Certificate will be able to travel abroad without hindrance and with peace of mind,” the focal person stated.
Overseas Pakistanis are important contributors to the economy through foreign remittances. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said last month that overseas workers’ remittances witnessed an increase of 8.41 per cent during the first quarter (July-September) of fiscal year 2025-26.
On a year-on-year basis, the SBP said workers’ remittances went up by 11.33pc in September to $3.183bn from $2.859bn during the same month last year.</p><small>2025-11-04 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04233403c9f751a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953107/contributions-all-around-as-pakistan-beat-south-africa-in-first-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Contributions all around as Pakistan beat South Africa in first ODI</strong></a><br><p>After the bowlers had done their job, the batters came good for Pakistan — albeit an all too familiar late collapse — at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday.
In the first international match at the venue in 17 years, Pakistan marked the start of Shaheen Shah Afridi’s era as One-day International captain with a two-wicket victory over South Africa to strike the opening blow in the three-match series.
Shaheen had won the toss and elected to field with his side riding on inspired spells of bowling by pacer Naseem Shah and spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl South Africa out for 263.
South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) — the duo sharing a 98-run opening stand.
But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up.
Half-centuries by Salman Ali Agha (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (57) then steadied Pakistan midway through their chase after Fakhar Zaman and Saim had laid the platform with a solid 87-run opening partnership.
Salman and Rizwan combined for another 91 after Pakistan had lost three quick wickets. Rizwan fell with Pakistan needing 68 more to win but Salman struck a breezy partnership with Hussain Talat and after the hosts had an all to familiar late collapse, Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen  saw them through to a confidence-boosting victory.
South Africa, meanwhile, will rue they were unable to capitalise on a storming start by Pretorius and De Kock.
Pretorius and De Kock, playing his first ODI since returning from retirement after the ODI World Cup, laid into the Pakistan attack from the start as South Africa reached 94-0 by the end of the 15th over.
Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay.
De Kock, however, was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls.
Shaheen, however, brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps, having hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock.
Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and one-drop Tony De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return.
Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job but just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22) and Donovan Ferreira soon became Abrar’s first victim.
Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.
South Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6.
The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish with Breetzke and Bosch but Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended the former’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball.
Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over.
Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams.
Saim and fellow opener Fakhar’s measured approach saw the side reach 53-0 in the first 10 overs. The duo stayed compact, avoiding any rash shots, but when opportunities came, they pounced on them.
After the pair added 34 more to the partnership, Saim (39 off 42, four fours and six) was trapped leg-before by South African spinner Linde, who surprised the left-hander with a quicker one.
Fakhar (45 off 57, four fours and two sixes) then holed Ferreira out to Fortuin in the deep before Fortuin struck gold with the ball, shooting in one to get Babar out lbw as Pakistan felt the heat at 106-3 by the end of the 20th over.
The hosts reached 129-3 halfway through the innings before Salman, and Rizwan at the other end amped up the run-rate, the latter flourishing with a lofted cover drive and a sweep for fours as Pakistan crossed the 150-run mark in the 29th over.
Boundaries, though, were at a premium after that – only three coming from overs 30 to 36; all of them from Rizwan’s bat. He raised his half century off 66 balls in the 37th over but fell soon after, having hit six fours in his 74-ball knock, finding Pretorius in the deep off Bosch.
Hussain, though, got going with a cracking cover drive for four, which left Pakistan needing 58 off the last 10 overs.
South Africa had restricted the boundaries in the next three overs but there was no stopping the singles as Hussain and Salman kept rotating the strike, chipping away at the total until the latter hoisted Ferreira down the ground for a sumptuous six to bring up his half-century off 56 balls.
Hussain made 22 off 25 with two fours before falling in the 46th over and was soon followed by Hasan Nawaz, stumped off Linde, before Salman departed on the last ball of the 48th over when he skied Lungi Ngidi to Ferreira – having only got the fifth four of his 71-ball innings on the previous delivery.
Nawaz, though, settled any nerves or creeping doubts when he launched Ferreira down the ground for six and despite him falling with the scores level, Pakistan got through with two balls to spare.</p><small>2025-11-04 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632131-artefacts-recovered-in-italy-returned-to-pakistan-after-decades-long-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Artefacts recovered in Italy returned to Pakistan after 'decades-long efforts'</strong></a><br><p>

The decision to hold the jirga at the assembly’s hall at 11am was taken in a high-level consultative meeting of the party’s KP leadership, which was jointly chaired by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and provincial PTI president Junaid Akbar.
The meeting was also attended by KPA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati; provincial secretary general Ali Azghar Khan; provincial ministers Meena Khan Afridi and Aftab Alam Khan; KP spokesperson Shafi Jan; MNAs Atif Khan, Dr Amjad Khan and Arbab Sher Ali and PTI Peshawar President Irfan Saleem.
 
 

The meeting discussed in detail the overall political situation in the province and matters of law and order, according to a statement. The participants consulted on various aspects of holding the peace jirga and future strategy.
The PTI leadership decided that all parties would be invited to participate so that all political leadership could be united on a single platform for the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the province.
The statement said the heads, presidents and general secretaries of all political parties in the province, former chief ministers, former governors, representatives of civil society and the dignitaries of the KP Bar Association would be invited to participate in the moot.
Atif told Dawn that the law and order situation had reached an alarming level in KP and the matter could not be overcome by a single political party.
“It will be a national peace jirga in which the leadership of around 20 political parties will be invited for discussion and decisions needed to be taken for the restoration of peace in the province,” he said.
He said that convening the peace jirga was an effort for a joint struggle and to convey a message with one voice related to the restoration of law and order. He said that all efforts would be made to develop a consensus in the upcoming peace moot.
Atif said CM Afridi also visited Paktunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas to invite them to participate.
National and political matters were discussed in the meeting, especially the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment and its possible impact on provincial autonomy.
 






Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that the share of the merged districts had not yet been provided in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, according to a statement issued from the Chief Minister’s House.
He said that tampering with the NFC award would be harmful to national unity. CM Afridi and Achakzai also discussed the situation in Kurram.
Achakzai assured the chief minister of his full cooperation to protect the constitutional and financial rights of the province.</p><small>2025-11-04 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/042045469d50c40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953129/6-killed-24-injured-in-shangla-road-accidents-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed, 24 injured in Shangla road accidents: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were killed and 24 others were injured in three separate accidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district on Tuesday.
According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Rasool Khan Sharif, the first incident occurred in the Naredaly area of tehsil Kana late on Monday evening, where a mini jeep plunged into a ravine, killing two and injuring six.
“Local residents transported the victims to the Karora Rural Health Centre, from where the injured were referred to Alpuri district headquarters hospital,” he told Dawn.
However, this morning, the roof of a house collapsed as people were offering funeral prayers for one of the two people killed in the crash. Sanaullah Khan, a resident, told Dawn that 11 people were injured in the roof collapse, which also occurred in the Naredaly area.
“Five people were critically injured as all of the mourners fell along with the coffin when the roof caved in,” he said. “Women and children in the house were injured after the roof collapsed.”
A local resident said that four of the 11 injured were transported to a hospital in Swat for further treatment, as their condition was critical.
Meanwhile, in another incident in the Sarkool area of Chakesar on Tuesday morning, four people were killed and seven others were injured in a traffic accident, according to police.
Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) Mustafa Kamal of Dandai police station told Dawn that a jeep was heading to Sarkool from the remote area of Taloon when it fell into a ravine.
“The victims were removed from the ravine and immediately rushed to the Rural Health Centre [in] Thakot,” he said. “The deceased and injured hailed from the same family and were residents of Taloon.”
Last month, at least two women were killed and 30 others were injured when a coaster carrying a wedding party collided with the mountainside on Jab road in KP’s Haripur, according to Rescue 1122.
A Rescue 1122 statement said the accident took place due to brake failure.
Subsequently, four Rescue 1122 ambulances and a rescue vehicle were sent to the site, it said, adding that the bodies and most of the injured were taken to the Trauma Centre in Haripur. Two of the injured, whose condition was critical, were sent to Abbottabad.</p><small>2025-11-04 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041658265c0b58d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953116/dick-cheney-former-us-vice-president-who-pushed-for-iraq-war-dies-at-84' target='_blank'><strong>Dick Cheney, former US vice president who pushed for Iraq war, dies at 84</strong></a><br><p>Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday.
Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.
The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win.
As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office.
He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration.
Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.
No such weapons were found.
 
 

He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation.
Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”.
His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters.
Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024.
“In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left.
Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012.
Taking on Iraq
Cheney and then-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.
In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory.
Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”.
Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power.

More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War.
He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire.
Because of Cheney’s long ties to the Bush family and experience in government, George W Bush chose him to head his vice presidential search in 2000. Bush then decided the man doing the search was the best candidate for the job.
Upon his re-entry into politics, Cheney received a $35 million retirement package from oil services firm Halliburton, which he had run from 1995 to 2000.
Halliburton became a leading government contractor during the Iraq War. Cheney’s oil industry links were a subject of frequent criticism by opponents of the war.
The first Republican in generations
Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to Marjorie Lorraine and Richard Herbert Cheney on January 30, 1941, the day then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned 59. His mother was a waitress turned softball player, his father a federal worker with the Soil Conservation Service.
Both sides of the family were staunch New Deal Democrats, he wrote in his 2011 book In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir. Convinced that the president would want to know that he shared a birthday with the newborn, Cheney’s grandfather urged Marjorie and Richard to share the news by telegram with the White House.
In his family, he “was the first Republican probably since my great-grandfather who fought in the Civil War on the Union side,” he told the PBS documentary Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away. He moved as a boy to Wyoming with his family before attending Yale University. “I was a mediocre student, at best,” he said. He dropped out.
‘A deadly allergy to olive drab’
Back in Wyoming in 1962, he worked on building electrical transmission lines and coal-fired power stations, before eventually earning undergraduate and master’s degrees in political science from the University of Wyoming.
Of that time, he recalled a visit by then-US president John F Kennedy, who addressed students on the importance of using what they were learning to build a better nation and a better world.
“He had inspired us all, and at a time when I was trying to put my life back together, I was particularly grateful for the sense of elevated possibilities he described,” Cheney wrote in his memoir.

In his 20s, Cheney strongly disagreed with the students who shut down campuses in protest against the Vietnam War, he recalled in his memoir.
“As a general proposition, I supported our troops in Vietnam and the right of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to make the decision to be involved there,” he wrote.
He himself was never drafted.
According to his biographer, John Nichols, Cheney repeatedly applied for deferments and exemptions to avoid conscription.
“Cheney reacted to the prospect of wearing his country’s uniform like a man with a deadly allergy to olive drab,” Nichols wrote in The Nation magazine in 2011. Cheney stated that he would have been happy to serve.
Embracing Darth Vader
Cheney went to Washington in 1969 as a congressional intern and held various White House jobs during the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.
One of his earliest mentors was Rumsfeld, who worked as the secretary of defence in both the Ford and George W Bush administrations. When Cheney became Ford’s chief of staff, he succeeded Rumsfeld.
During the 10 years he served as Wyoming’s only congressman, Cheney had a highly conservative record, consistently voting against abortion rights. He also voted against the release of imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela and against gun control and environmental and education funding measures.
His wife, Lynne, who had been his high school sweetheart, became a conservative voice on cultural issues. Liz, the couple’s eldest daughter, was elected to the House in 2016 after building a reputation for pushing hawkish foreign policy views similar to her father’s.
During his time as vice president, late-night television comedians referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. He shrugged it off by joking that he was honoured to be compared to the Star Wars villain, even dressing as Vader for an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show’ to promote his memoir.
‘Thank you to satan’
Even before the rise of Trump, his support for conservative issues was not uniform.
His second daughter, Mary, a Republican fundraiser, is a lesbian. Cheney spoke supportively of same-sex relationships, which put him at odds with the Bush administration’s push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage. That amendment ultimately failed.
In 2006, he made headlines during a hunting trip in Texas when he accidentally wounded his friend, Texas lawyer Harry Wittington, in the face with a spray of birdshot.
Controversy continued to dog Cheney even after he left the Bush administration. He was the subject of a scathing biographical film in 2018 titled Vice, starring Christian Bale, who gained 18 kilogrammes and shaved his head to mimic the former vice president’s paunchiness and baldness.
“Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” Bale said in accepting a Golden Globes award for his Cheney portrayal.
During a book tour for his memoir, Cheney seemed to relish raising the ire of critics. Just before its release, he gleefully predicted it would leave heads “exploding” all over Washington.
He devoted parts of the book to settling scores with former colleagues such as Rice, whom he depicted as naive. Cheney also took aim at then-president Barack Obama’s worldview, puzzling over the Democrat’s concern that the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba was harmful to America’s image.</p><small>2025-11-04 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04193458812bb74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953125/jui-provincial-council-member-gunned-down-in-charsadda-police' target='_blank'><strong>JUI provincial council member gunned down in Charsadda: police</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) provincial council member Hafiz Maulana Abdul Salam Arif was shot dead by unidentified motorcyclists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda district on Tuesday, according to a police officer.
According to Investigating Officer (IO) Safdar Khan, the JUI member was on his way home after offering prayers at a mosque when he was attacked by two armed suspects on a motorcycle.
“The incident is being investigated from all possible angles,” the IO said. “Police have collected evidence from the crime scene and have also called in a team of experts to provide assistance.”
The IO added that the victim’s son filed a case with the Mandani police station.
In addition to being a provincial council member, the slain Abdul Salam was the head of Madressah Abu Bakar Siddique in Tehsil Tangi and the preacher at a mosque within the area of the Jamalabad Dairy Farm.
In July this year, Awami National Party politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”</p><small>2025-11-04 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632101-27th-constitutional-amendment-to-be-tabled-soon-after-consulting-allies-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>27th Constitutional Amendment to be tabled soon after consulting allies: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported.
“Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.”
In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup.
“The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said.
During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points.
The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson.
During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s
Arshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.”
The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft.
During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said.
“As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.”
The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points.
“This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework.
“In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.</p><small>2025-11-04 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04181443ec76d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953105/pia-operations-restored-after-engineers-strike-causes-delays-to-several-international-flights' target='_blank'><strong>PIA operations ‘restored’ after engineers’ strike causes delays to several international flights</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday said it has restored flight operations with some alternate arrangements after delays due to what it called a “strike” by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP).
However, the SAEP stated there was no strike from their side and the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols.
PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country last night after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety.
The PIA said in a statement today: “A de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“
It asserted that the PIA’s management team, along with key officials of the engineering department, immediately responded to the situation.
“By using alternative means and working tirelessly overnight and day, [the airline] restored the operations, thus mitigating the impact of already delayed flights for subsequent operations,” the statement added.
 






The airline assured the public that “flight operations are being fully restored and customer convenience is our utmost priority and that our operations run smoothly”.
According to the PIA, a total of seven flights — three from Islamabad, two from Karachi, and one each from Lahore and Sialkot — departed after delays ranging from four to 14 hours.
Five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers.
 
 

A protest had been ongoing for the last two-and-a-half months, with the engineers fastening black ribbons around their arms while working.
However, the situation escalated when the SAEP members discontinued issuing clearance to airplanes, disrupting the flight operations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports.
SAEP president Abdullah Jadoon told Dawn that more than 570 aircraft engineers associated with the PIA were on strike and vowed to continue it until their demands were fulfilled.
Earlier today, a senior SAEP member had denied that the society was staging a strike. They insisted that the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols as per their responsibilities.
“Unfortunately, instead of addressing long-pending professional and financial concerns, the PIA management has chosen to label lawful compliance as disruption, which is misleading,” the SAEP member said.
A spokesperson for the PIA had said the SAEP had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages.
Similar delays have occurred at nearly all major airports in the last two months due to engineers’ protests seeking a pay hike and other issues.
Flights impacted
According to the details provided by the PIA, flights that departed after the adjustment of revised slots/crew arrangement included the following:

Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights
to be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states.
The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”.
“Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads.
It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”.
Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.”
The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”.
The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea.
Legislation and election
The legislation was bulldozed through the Punjab Assembly on October 13, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s strong intervention and announcement that much-delayed local government elections in the province would be held under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December.
The ECP had rejected all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new PLGA and launched its delimitation process in the province from October 9.
The ECP order, however, was reversed on Oct 21 in light of the new legislation after a request by the Punjab government, which was given more time to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules. Later, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year, as it would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
PTI’s objections
The treasury had steamrolled the PLGA bill through the Punjab Assembly amid strong protests and disruptions by the opposition.
Subsequently, the PTI announced on November 2 that the legislation would be challenged in the LHC.
PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers.
They say the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.
They have demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.</p><small>2025-11-04 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04173125e307a5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953119/tlp-leadership-cadre-from-central-punjab-lahore-severs-ties-with-banned-party' target='_blank'><strong>TLP leadership cadre from central Punjab, Lahore severs ties with banned party</strong></a><br><p>Ticket holders and office bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) from central Punjab and Lahore on Tuesday announced that they were severing ties with the now-banned organisation, stating that they were “standing with the state”.
On Friday, all election ticket holders of the TLP from south Punjab announced that they had left the party, accusing it of pursuing an anti-state agenda that “aligns with the country’s enemies”.
In a press conference at the Lahore Press Club today, multiple TLP ticket holders and office bearers announced their decision to step away from the religiopolitical group, with lawyer Usman Khizr Mangat saying that one can engage in politics within the state, but not against it.
“Violence and mobs cannot create an impact by attacking the state,” he said. “Pakistan saw how these people carried out attacks. The government tried to start a dialogue, but the demands laid out were not accepted.
“The state is like a mother, it tried to negotiate for six, seven days constantly with these people (the TLP) and outlined Pakistan’s situation and its standing in the international community.”
Mangat noted that the unrest took place at a time when the country is “on red alert because of India in the east and Afghanistan in the northwest”.
“You saw that buses were stolen, people were armed and school buses carrying girls were hijacked. What kind of politics is this?” he questioned.
“Other parties protest under the Constitution and the law; they have the right to freedom of movement and freedom of speech, but you cannot exercise those rights at the cost of causing unrest within the state.”
Mangat added that the TLP “always thought themselves above the Constitution, the law and the state”, adding that this attitude could not be tolerated in any case.
“I, Barrister Usman Khizer Mangat, along with these ticket holders and officer bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, announce the end of our time with the TLP,” he stated.
“I am here to show my solidarity with the state,” Mangat added. “I stand with my state under any circumstance; it is my state and my state has been established. If my politics compromises my state’s stability and security, it is better I do not engage in politics.
“I am making it very clear that I am not under any pressure. With my free will, I am announcing that I am standing alongside the state.”</p><small>2025-11-04 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041821351fefc5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953123/india-ramps-up-support-after-afghan-quake-vying-with-china-for-influence' target='_blank'><strong>India ramps up support after Afghan quake, vying with China for influence</strong></a><br><p>India is ramping up aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and branding itself as the region’s “first responder” after Monday’s deadly earthquake, seeking to counter China’s efforts to fill the void left by the West, officials and analysts said.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was among the first to call his Taliban counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi on Monday, pledging more support after New Delhi shipped 15 tonnes of food.
Medical supplies would follow soon, he said, as his ministry promoted the hashtag #IndiaFirstResponder on X.
China on Tuesday said it too was ready to assist after the quake near Mazar-i-Sharif killed at least 20 people and injured more than 900.
India wields soft power
 
 

Both Asian giants are keen to deepen engagement with the Taliban, said Harsh Pant, head of foreign policy studies at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. India’s ties with Afghanistan have warmed in recent weeks, even as relations between both countries and Pakistan have soured.
“Behind India’s outreach to Afghanistan is the idea to create a certain resonance and goodwill among the local population as a form of soft power,” Pant said. “It’s unlikely India can fill the gap left by Western nations, but if it does not make an effort then China will.”
India hosted Muttaqi last month for six days and announced plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, shut since 2021. It also pledged cooperation on hydroelectric projects and support for healthcare and public infrastructure.
“The reopening of the Indian embassy sends a political signal, short of India’s recognition of the Taliban, of a stronger Indian presence on the ground,” an Indian official said, adding that more aid would follow.
Muttaqi’s visit coincided with worsening Afghan Taliban-Pakistan relations after border clashes. Last week, India secured a six-month US sanctions waiver to operate Iran’s Chabahar port, boosting trade with Afghanistan and reducing Kabul’s reliance on Pakistan’s Karachi port.
Beijing eyes mining opportunities
China, which maintains close ties with Pakistan, told Afghanistan in August it was keen to explore mining and mineral opportunities and urged Kabul to formally join its Belt and Road Initiative.
Chinese and Indian support is crucial for the Taliban, which seized power after US-led Nato forces withdrew in 2021, but remains shunned by Western nations over restrictions on women and UN sanctions.
“Afghanistan’s isolation from the international banking system and the absence of normal coordination channels have made it far harder for aid and development funds to move,” said Ibraheem Bahiss of the International Crisis Group.
“Afghanistan’s humanitarian needs are not reducing — if anything, they’re rising because the population keeps growing while economic growth remains stagnant.”</p><small>2025-11-04 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632089-pakistan-welcomes-indias-sikh-pilgrims-for-guru-nanak-anniversary-first-since-may-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan welcomes India's Sikh pilgrims, first since May war</strong></a><br><p>

India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
President Zardari addressed the issue while speaking at the Second World Summit for Social Development in Doha, Qatar today, saying: “We in Pakistan, on one hand, face the brunt of the impact of climate change, which has caused devastation for our people in the form of large-scale floods … on the other hand, we face a new threat in the form of water weaponisation. Water, which all the world knows, is an equal right of any human being and humanity.”
“We are being threatened from across the border with a new threat in the form of weaponisation of water, violation of the IWT. This poses a serious threat to 240 million Pakistanis. Such tactics cannot and will not succeed.”
 


A supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The president also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to social justice, inclusive development and global solidarity, emphasising the need to eradicate poverty, promote decent work and ensure equality and human rights for all.
The president expressed full support for the Doha Political Declaration and highlighted that the country’s vision for inclusiveness and sustainable development aligned with the spirit of the declaration.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in placing people at the centre of policy,” President Zardari added.
Showcasing Pakistan’s progress, he cited the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which he said had empowered over nine million families through income assistance, healthcare and education. The initiative, he said, was recognised globally as one of the best social protection models.
He also reaffirmed the country’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, pledging to raise literacy to 90 per cent and ensure every child attended school within five years.
The president also mentioned initiatives such as the National Youth Internship Programme and green and resilient housing projects, which aim to empower young people and strengthen climate resilience through nature-based solutions, including mangrove restoration.
Outlining a roadmap to translate the Doha Declaration into action, Zardari urged the world to unite around three pillars: dignity, equality and solidarity, emphasising global financial reforms, debt relief, equitable taxation and expanded social protection.
Condemning  the “genocide, apartheid, and mass starvation” in Palestine, the president also called for a just and lasting peace.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for the people of Kashmir, linking both struggles as two sides of the same coin in the pursuit of justice and self-determination.
“Development must begin and end with the betterment of people,” President Zardari said, adding that “we must rise above all differences to embark on a path of compassion and progress for all.”
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also drew the attention of the UN secretary general to India’s weaponisation of water, pointing out that India had unilaterally and illegally suspended the water-sharing agreement and stopped providing discharge data on rivers, creating man-made disasters for Pakistan.
In a meeting with the UN chief, President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong support for multilateralism and the central role of the UN in promoting peace, equity and shared prosperity.
He underscored the importance of resolving longstanding disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and called for the reversal of India’s unilateral and illegal measures.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s principled position on Palestine, stressing the need to end the suffering of the Palestinian people and to uphold their right to self-determination through the establishment of a viable, contiguous, and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He also appreciated the UN chief’s leadership in addressing global challenges and for his continued support to Pakistan.
The president raised the issue of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, recalling that it remained one of the oldest unresolved items on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
He urged the implementation of relevant UN resolutions to ensure a just and lasting settlement in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
President Zardari also highlighted Pakistan’s longstanding contribution to UN peacekeeping operations, noting that Pakistani peacekeepers had served with distinction in conflict zones across the world.
The UN chief acknowledged Pakistan’s significant role in peacekeeping and expressed solidarity with Pakistan in its efforts to combat terrorism.
 






Meetings with Iraqi, Tajik counterparts
Zardari also met Iraqi counterpart Dr Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid, both reviewing the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirming their mutual commitment to further strengthening longstanding ties.
Discussing trade and investment, both sides underlined the importance of enhancing economic linkages through increased business-to-business interactions and facilitative visa regimes.
President Zardari appreciated Iraq’s cooperation in facilitating Pakistani pilgrims and acknowledged the valuable contribution of the Pakistani community in Iraq, which served as a bridge of goodwill between the two nations.
The two leaders also exchanged views on regional peace, stability and cooperation, agreeing to maintain regular high-level contacts to advance bilateral relations.
The Iraqi president again invited President Zardari to visit Iraq.
The president accepted the invitation and stated that he would undertake the visit soon after the Iraqi parliamentary elections, scheduled for later this month.
 






He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity, energy, defence and people-to-people exchanges with Tajikistan.
President Zardari said that Pakistan greatly valued its multifaceted relationship with Tajikistan, rooted in shared history, culture, and linguistic affinity.
He noted that the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in 2024 reflected the growing depth of ties between the two countries. He welcomed the resumption of work on the CASA-1000 project, terming it a flagship initiative for shared prosperity, and invited Tajikistan to explore new avenues of trade and connectivity through Pakistan, including the possibility of restoring direct flights.
President Zardari also commended the successful Dosti-II joint military exercise held in August 2025 and reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to assist Tajikistan in defence cooperation and capacity building.
The Tajik president invited Zardari to visit the country, which the latter accepted.
The two leaders also shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.

The 50-year-old former England soccer captain received the honour at the royal residence, more than 20 years after he was awarded a separate royal honour recognising his contribution to football.
Beckham, a lifelong admirer of the royal family, was dressed in a suit designed by his wife, Victoria Beckham, a fashion designer and former member of the Spice Girls pop band.
‘Doesn’t get any better’
He and King Charles shared a brief but warm exchange during the ceremony, with the king seen smiling and laughing as they spoke.
Coming out of the ceremony, Beckham said he cried when he first found out he was being awarded the knighthood.
“It’s such a big moment for our family and it’s so special,” Beckham told reporters, joking that he would not mind if his kids called him “sir dad”.
“I’m very proud to have such a special honour given to me. I grew up in a very humble background in the East End of London; always wanted to be a professional footballer; and then I’m stood here at Windsor Castle with the most important monarchy in the world,” he said, adding that “it doesn’t get any better”.
From East Londo to global stardom
Born in east London, Beckham made his Premier League debut for Manchester United in 1995, two years after he joined as a trainee. He went on to win six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League with the club, before playing for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.
He retired in 2013 with 115 England caps.
Known for his precise free kicks and crossing ability, Beckham also became one of the most commercially successful athletes of his era. He has worked with brands such as Adidas, luxury brand Armani, high-street retailer H&M and Pepsi and has been a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 2005.
According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Beckham and his wife have a combined net worth of 500 million pounds ($671m).
A ‘huge royalist’ with ties to the monarchy
Beckham has long expressed admiration for the royal family, describing himself as a “huge royalist”.
In 2022, Beckham queued for more than 12 hours to pay his respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II as she lay in state at Westminster Hall, declining offers to skip the line.
“I grew up in a household of royalists,” he told ITV at the time. “
If my grandparents would have been today, I know that they would have wanted to be here.”
He attended both Prince William’s 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton and Prince Harry’s 2018 wedding to Meghan Markle.
Beckham has also developed a personal rapport with the King, sharing a mutual interest in gardening.
Last year, he was appointed an ambassador for the King’s Foundation, which supports education and sustainability initiatives.
Life beyond the pitch
Beckham married Victoria Adams, known as “Posh Spice” from the all-women Spice Girls pop group, in 1999. The couple have four children.
They opened up about their relationship in two Netflix documentaries. The series touched on the pressures of fame, family tensions and the challenges they faced during Beckham’s playing career, including tabloid speculation and time spent apart due to his international transfers.
Beckham has described his family as his “greatest achievement”.</p><small>2025-11-04 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632082-proposed-27th-amendment-tantamount-to-undoing-provincial-autonomy-raza-rabbani' target='_blank'><strong>Proposed 27th amendment tantamount to undoing provincial autonomy: Raza Rabbani</strong></a><br><p>

More than 2,100 pilgrims were granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith, Pakistan’s High Commission (embassy) in New Delhi said last week.

Tensions remain high between Islamabad and New Delhi after the worst fighting since 1999 took place in May. The Wagah-Attari border — the only active land crossing between the two countries — was closed to general traffic following the conflict.
Pilgrims queued up on the Indian side of the border on Tuesday morning, some carrying their luggage on their heads, as the Indian Border Security Force looked on.

AFP journalists on the Pakistani side of the Wagah-Attari border saw dozens of them entering Pakistan.
They were received by Pakistani officials who presented them with flowers and showered them with rose petals.

Indian media reported that around 1,700 were due to cross into Pakistan, although there was no immediate official confirmation from Indian authorities.
The pilgrims will gather tomorrow at Nankana Sahib, Guru Nanak’s birthplace, about 80 kilometres west of Lahore by road, and later visit other sacred sites in Pakistan, including Kartarpur, where the guru is buried.

Pakistan’s High Commission had said last week its decision was consistent with efforts to promote “inter-religious and inter-cultural harmony and understanding”.
Indian newspapers reported Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel to Pakistan.
The Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free route that opened in 2019 that allows Indian Sikhs to visit the temple without crossing the main border, has remained closed since the conflict.

The four-day clashes between the arch-rivals broke out in May after New Delhi, without any evidence, accused Islamabad of backing an attack targeting tourists in India-occupied Kashmir on April 22 — claims that Pakistan has strongly denied.
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion born in the 15th century in Punjab, a region spanning parts of what is now India and Pakistan.
The frontier between the two countries was a colonial creation drawn at the violent end of British rule in 1947, which sliced the subcontinent into India and  Pakistan.
While most Sikhs migrated to India during partition, some of their most revered places of worship ended up in Pakistan, including the shrines in Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur.

“A gas blast occurred at a canteen in the basement of the Supreme Court building at around 10:55am,” Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said while speaking to the media after the incident.
He added that of the 12 injured, nine were taken to the Polyclinic hospital and three to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). IG Rizvi further told the reporters that the condition of two of the injured was “serious” who had sustained 80 per cent and 30pc burns. “The rest suffered minor injuries, most of which are burn injuries.”
In multiple videos received by Dawn following the incident, the damaged interior of parts of the SC building is visible with blood stains on the floor. In other videos recorded outside, people, including lawyers, could be seen spilling out of the building.
The IG said police, including special branch and along with bomb disposal squad and Rescue 1122 personnel, had visited the scene of the incident and carried out an investigation.
“Initial probe revealed that there had been complaints of gas leakage in the canteen located in the basement and a tea room for around past three days. Plumbers and technicians who work at the Supreme Court were looking into those,” he said.
He further stated that there was considerable leakage in the canteen today as well. Meanwhile, two of the air conditioners in the canteen were not working properly, he added.
“Technicians were repairing them, during which gas accumulated […] and a blast occurred.”
The IG said among the injured, the technicians repairing the air conditioners were most affected.
He also assured that no traces of any kind of explosives were found at the site.

“Today marks a historic milestone in that journey as we celebrate the invaluable partnership between Google and Pakistan,” Dar said while addressing a ceremony marking the launch in Islamabad.
 






Terming the move a “defining moment for our country’s digital transformation”, the deputy PM said localising the assembly of Chromebooks would make access to digital tools more affordable and inclusive, particularly in the education sector.
Dar, who is also the foreign minister, said the assembly line’s establishment held great economic significance as it laid the “foundation for jobs, supply chain, development and future tech exports”.
Dar said that under a strategic memorandum of understanding, Google and Pakistan would “collaborate to provide skills training for 100,000 developers nationwide while also developing targeted programmes for the gaming and startup industries”.
“Together, we will also advance localised AI-powered solutions, such as Android services for public safety and offer 100,000 Google Careers certificates to equip Pakistanis with world-class digital training and globally recognised credentials,” the deputy premier said.
 


“Google’s decision to open its local office in Pakistan is not just symbolic; it is a moment for national pride and a powerful endorsement of our country’s digital potential,” Dar stressed.
He added that it represented a “strategic milestone with far-reaching implications for the digital economy, the innovation ecosystem and global investor confidence”.
The deputy PM noted that Google’s local presence would bring it “closer to Pakistan’s developers, startups and entrepreneurs, enabling direct collaboration, capacity building, and great access to global platforms”.
During his address, Dar appreciated Defence Production Minister Muhammad Raza Hayat and Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) National Coordinator Lt Gen Sarfraz Ahmad for their contribution in “all such efforts”.
 
 

Meanwhile, in her remarks at the launch IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja termed the launch of Chromebook’s assembly line as a transformative step, Radio Pakistan reported.
Khawaja highlighted that the move brought together technology, manufacturing and education. She expressed the government’s commitment to continuing Pakistan’s digital journey at a fast pace.
In June last year, Google for Education’s country partner Tech Valley, National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC), and Australia-based manufacturer Allied announced their intent to establish a Google Chromebook assembly line in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur.
Yesterday, a delegation of Tech Valley led by Kevin Kalis called on Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Lahore and promised support to establish a Google Chromebook manufacturing factory in Punjab to boost technology-driven education and local IT infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04121242007cea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953096/4-militants-killed-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-kalat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 militants killed in intelligence-based operation in Kalat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on the night of November 1, security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of militants belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
“Weapons and ammunition [were] also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” it added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area,” the statement said, adding that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to wipe out foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for eliminating the terrorists, his official account posted on social media platform X.
“The nation stands firmly with its forces in their resolve to root out terrorism under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also hailed the armed forces, reiterating that the entire nation stood in their support with an unwavering resolve to protect the homeland, APP reported.
“Pakistan would continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country,” the premier reaffirmed.
The development comes a day after the ISPR said at least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632052-e-challans-continue-in-karachi-for-traffic-violations' target='_blank'><strong>3,400 e-challans in a day — what were Karachi drivers fined for?</strong></a><br><p>

The visit comes as Trump pushes Saudi Arabia to join the list of nations that have joined the Abraham Accords. In 2020, Trump reached deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco to normalise relations with Israel.
The Saudis have been hesitant to join in the absence of steps toward Palestinian statehood.
Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he believed the Saudis would ultimately join the accords.
The US president also said earlier this month that he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hoped Saudi Arabia would join the pact. In August, he also stressed the importance of Middle Eastern countries joining the accords.
Trump and the crown prince may also discuss a US-Saudi defence agreement. The Financial Times reported two weeks ago that there were hopes the two countries could sign such an agreement during Salman’s visit.
 
 

A senior Trump administration official told Reuters that “there are discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but details are in flux“.
The Saudis have sought formal US guarantees to defend the kingdom as well as access to more advanced US weaponry.
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms, and the two countries have maintained strong ties for decades based on an arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and Washington provides security.
During Trump’s visit to Riyadh in May, the US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion. Trump had also welcomed a promise by Salman, for $600 billion in investment and quipped that it should be $1 trillion.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632034-27th-and-counting-a-constitutional-makeover' target='_blank'><strong>27th and counting: A constitutional makeover?</strong></a><br><p>
