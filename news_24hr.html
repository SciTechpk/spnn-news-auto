“Mamdani would sit with me in the production room. He would always ask me, so who is affected by this one? Who pays the price?” Beyanga, The Daily Monitor’s media manager, told Reuters.
“He was always interested in how the big picture affects the everyday person,” Beyanga said.
The 34-year-old Mamdani’s resolutely progressive message, focused on lowering the cost of living and addressing inequalities through direct government interventions, propelled him to victory in an election on Tuesday that drew the highest turnout since 1969 in the most populous US city.
Young Mamdani lived ‘in a simple way’ despite privilege
The son of a Ugandan academic of Indian origins and an Indian-American filmmaker, Mamdani was born and spent several years as a child in Uganda’s capital Kampala, where the family lived in an affluent suburb near the shores of Lake Victoria.
He also spent stints in South Africa, India and the United States, where his father Mahmood teaches at Columbia University.
While his immediate surroundings in Kampala’s leafy Buziga neighbourhood bore little resemblance to the stark poverty of the city’s vast slums, mentors from his intern days said the 15-year-old Mamdani already had a fierce interest in questions of economic injustice rooted in his experiences in Uganda.

“Living in Uganda, where we have problems of inequality and corruption — that must have made an impression on him,” said Mark Namanya, who was a sports editor at The Daily Monitor.
Mamdani has acknowledged in the past that his upbringing was “privileged” and denied any tension between that and his leftist policy positions.
Beyanga said that during Mamdani’s internship, he would eat lunch at a makeshift canteen that served steamed plantains and maize meal porridge to the city’s working classes and liked to ride bodas, or motorbike taxis, around town.
“He liked life lived in a simple way, nothing exaggerated,” Beyanga said.
Mamdani had strong feelings on political subjects
Mamdani’s father had known hardship. In 1972, Mahmood Mamdani and his family were among tens of thousands of people of Asian descent whom Uganda’s dictator, Idi Amin, expelled from the country, accusing them of exploiting the economy.
Mahmood fled to Britain before returning to Uganda after Amin’s fall.
Despite his young age, Mamdani had strong feelings about major geopolitical topics, Beyanga and Namanya said. Namanya recalled one conversation about foreign aid, a subject at the centre of US political discussion this year following US President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
While liberals condemned the Trump administration’s moves to slash aid to poor countries, the young Mamdani had a sceptical view of foreign assistance rooted in leftist critiques of the system as benefiting donor countries at the expense of their purported beneficiaries, Namanya said.
“Zohran was the first person, which is odd because I was older than him, to explain to me how aid to African countries was a sham,” he said.

Hannington Muhumuza, a music producer who worked with Mamdani on the soundtrack of Queen of Katwe — a 2016 film by Mamdani’s mother Mira Nair about a girl living in a Kampala slum who becomes a successful chess player — said Mamdani knew the harsh reality of what life was like for many poor Ugandans.
“He has been to all the places, the ghettos, he knows how really life is and how really the average Ugandan is living,” Muhumuza told Reuters. “For him, it was always about… how can he uplift them. How can he be a part of their life and impact them in a positive way… That is something that I really noticed about him.”</p><small>2025-11-06 19:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06234111a03c8c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953530/tarar-sees-no-major-roadblocks-or-impediments-to-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar sees no ‘major roadblocks or impediments’ to 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties in what appeared to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get the 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by parliament. Tarar was present during these meetings.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
The information minister added that the objective is “always to strengthen governance, defence and relations between the federation and the provinces”.
Tarar mainstained that he “looked forward” to the outcome of the PPP’s Central Executive Committee meeting, which was being held on Thursday night. “I feel that good ideas will emerge from that meeting,” he said.
The minister added that once the proposals are tabled in parliament, a joint committee comprising leaders of all parliamentary parties from both Houses would be formed to review them.
“The Constitution is a living document that can be updated in line with the country’s evolving needs,” he explained.
“The [idea of the] 27th Amendment was born from the 26th,” Tarar said, adding that debates on the idea of a constitutional court had been ongoing since around 2005, and based on the demands of lawyers, a constitutional bench had been formed.
The minister also “categorically” clarified that amid talks about the 27th Amendment, no one would be meddling with the 18th Amendment. He added that Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also previously assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the new legislation.
An ‘attack’ on the House
A day earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the parliament, termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said his party would continue to raise their voices against it.
“Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs,” he had said.
The PTI chairman said the proposed amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urged that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
Meanwhile, responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
Chaudhry also denounced the attempts to make the proposed amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.</p><small>2025-11-06 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/062146067cf9bc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953525/no-new-notification-needed-for-coas-5-year-term-says-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No new notification needed for COAS’ 5-year term, says state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Thursday that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C [of the Pakistan Army Act].
“I do not think there is a need [for a notification] and the reason is the lawmaking we did, which specifies that [section] 8C, will be read in the same manner as it has always been part of this legislation and hence, it is five years,” said the state minister.
Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the Chief of the Army Staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the Chief of the Army Staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.
In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and
extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years.
However, the tenure of chairman joint chiefs of staff remained unchanged, at
three years.
In an interview with Independent Urdu today, Barrister Malik said no new notification is required for the COAS’ 5-year term and the section has always been a part of legislation.
When asked his opinion on whether the government intends to keep the designations of field marshal and army chief separate, Malik pointed out that army chiefs are 4-star generals while the field marshal’s rank is a 5-star position.
“When there are ranks, other things are associated with them, and they should be considered as well,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of Pakistan becoming a part of the Gaza International Stabilisation Force, the state minister said a definitive answer at this time would be premature.
He highlighted that the foreign ministers of eight Muslim countries met in Istanbul and any announcement would be made accordingly. “My comment would be premature,” Barrister Malik said.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.</p><small>2025-11-06 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632428-ppp-cec-meeting-underway-to-discuss-proposed-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PPP CEC meeting underway to discuss proposed 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

The United States formally circulated the draft resolution to the 15 council members late on Wednesday and has said it has regional support from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates for the text.
“The message is: if the region is with us on this and the region is with us on how this resolution is constructed, then we believe that the council should be as well,” the senior US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to be adopted.
When asked when the draft text could be put to a vote, the official said: “The sooner that we move, the better. We’re looking at weeks, not months.
“Russia and China will certainly have their inputs, and we’ll take those as they come. But at the end of the day, I do not see those countries standing in the way and blocking what is probably the most promising plan for peace in a generation,” the official said.
International force would have authority to disarm Hamas
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, would authorise a Board of Peace transitional governance administration to establish a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza that could “use all necessary measures” — language for force — to carry out its mandate.
The ISF would be authorised to protect civilians and humanitarian aid operations, work to secure border areas with Israel, Egypt and a “newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force”.

The ISF would stabilise security in Gaza by “ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups“.
The official said the draft UN resolution gives the ISF authority to disarm Hamas, but that the US was still expecting Hamas to “live up to its end of the agreement” and give up its weapons.
Hamas has not said whether it will agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza, something the group has rejected before.
International force likely around 20,000 troops
The senior US official said the ISF was shaping up to be around 20,000 troops. While the Trump administration has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan to contribute.
“We’ve been in steady contact with the potential troop contributors, and what they need in terms of a mandate, what type of language they need,” said the official. “Almost all of the countries are looking to have some type of international mandate. The preferred is UN.”
The official said he was unaware if Israel had ruled out any specific countries from contributing troops to the ISF, but added: “We’re in constant conversations with them.”
Israel said last month it would not accept Turkish armed forces in Gaza under the US peace plan.
Israel and Hamas agreed a month ago to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage release deal. That 20-point plan is annexed to the draft UN Security Council resolution.
“Time is not on our side here. The ceasefire is holding, but it is fragile, and … we cannot get bogged down in wordsmithing in the council. I think this is a real test for the United Nations,” the senior US official said.</p><small>2025-11-06 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06224258a7d444e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953526/de-kock-smashes-ton-as-south-africa-level-odi-series-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>De Kock smashes ton as South Africa level ODI series against Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Quinton de Kock’s masterful unbeaten 123 powered South Africa to a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over Pakistan in the second One-day International at Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Thursday, levelling the three-match series 1-1 with a chase completed in just 40.1 overs.
Chasing 270, South Africa openers Lhuan-dre Pretorius and de Kock made a confident start, adding 81 in 11.5 overs. Pretorius, dropped by Mohammad Nawaz at deep square, raced to 46 off 40 balls with seven fours and a six before edging Mohammad Wasim to Rizwan.  De Kock reached his fifty off 55 balls and accelerated seamlessly.
De Kock anchored with poise and power for his 22nd ODI century, and Tony de Zorzi, whose aggressive 76 off 63 balls formed a match-winning 153-run partnership for the second wicket with the former after Pretorius had set the tone with 46.
De Zorzi shifted gears immediately upon arrival, smashing two sixes off Nawaz in the 23rd over. He fell in the 35th over after hitting nine fours and three sixes — chipping a leading edge to point off Faheem Ashraf.
De Kock brought up his hundred off 99 balls with a flick to midwicket, punishing loose deliveries with sixes off Faheem and Shaheen.
With captain Matthew Breetzke in support, he sealed the chase in the 41st over, guiding spinner  Saim Ayub to backward point for the winning single —South Africa’s joint-biggest win over Pakistan in Pakistan by wickets.
Earlier, Pakistan, electing to bat first under clear skies, staged a remarkable lower-order recovery to post 269 for 9 after a top-order collapse triggered by pacer Nandre Burger threatened to derail their innings.
Standout performances came from Saim, who anchored the early recovery with a composed 53, and Salman Ali Agha, whose patient 69 formed the backbone of the middle order before Nawaz delivered a match-turning 59, blending responsibility with aggression, while Faheem’s brisk 28 injected crucial momentum in the death overs.
The hosts suffered an early jolt when opener Fakhar Zaman gloved a sharp Burger bouncer to wicket-keeper de Kock for a three-ball duck. Babar Azam fell for 11, edging Burger to first slip, and Mohammad Rizwan lasted just four balls before being bowled for four. At 22 for 3 in the fifth over, Pakistan were reeling.
Saim and Salman steadied the ship with a 92-run stand for the fourth wicket. Saim played with composure for his 53 off 66 balls, including five fours and a six, before getting caught and bowled by pacer Corbin Bosch.
Salman anchored meanwhile, finding five boundaries before being yorked by Bosch in the 41st over.
Hussain Talat’s brief 10 ended caught off Nqabayomzi Peter’s leg-spin, leaving Pakistan at 131 for 5. Nawaz then turned the tide with a belligerent 59 off 59 balls — three fours and four sixes — lifting the scoring rate against the spinners.  Faheem chipped in with two sixes and as many fours, before falling to Burger.
The tail added 90 runs in the last 10 overs, with Nawaz’s late assault. Burger was the pick of the bowlers with 4-46, while Bosch took 2-58 and Peter 3-55.
The series decider will be played at the same venue on Saturday.</p><small>2025-11-06 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632419-russian-mps-due-next-week-to-bolster-relations' target='_blank'><strong>Russian MPs due next week to bolster relations</strong></a><br><p>

This development comes as Islamabad and Kabul are having talks in Istanbul to expand a ceasefire called after five days of border clashes last month.
In a post on X, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strongly rejected the allegations coming from Kabul.
“Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner,” the ministry wrote.
It added that the situation was brought under control thanks to the “responsible action by Pakistani forces” and emphasised that the ceasefire remains intact.
“Pakistan remains committed to ongoing dialogue and expects reciprocity from Afghan authorities,” the post concluded.
 






Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid levelled allegations that Pakistani forces opened fire in the Spin Boldak area while delegations from both countries were having talks in Istanbul.
“While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side has begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” the spokesperson wrote.
“The Islamic Emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction,” he added. “It is worth noting that in the previous round of negotiations, both sides had agreed to extend the ceasefire and prevent any acts of aggression.”
 






Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.</p><small>2025-11-06 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061401317e38574.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953502/27th-constitutional-amendment-on-the-agenda-as-pm-shehbaz-holds-flurry-of-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>27th Constitutional Amendment on the agenda as PM Shehbaz holds flurry of meetings</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties on Thursday in what appears to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get a 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by Parliament.
Among those he met was a seven-member delegation of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), which was led by party Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, Members of National Assembly Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting.
They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the  Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q).
 






Meanwhile, the PM held a meeting with Balochistan Awami Party President and Federal Minister for Science and Technology Khalid Hussain Magsi and Senator Manzoor Ahmed Kakar, while he hosted Pakistan Muslim League Zia (PML-Z) MNA Ijazul Haq for a separate meeting.

PM Shehbaz also spoke with National Party MNA Mir Palin Baloch and hosted an ANP delegation led by party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and Senator Umar Farooq.
A separate PMO statement said party President and Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry were part of the IPP delegation that held a meeting with PM Shehbaz and discussed the proposed 27th Amendment.
 






Another statement by the PMO said the premier also met a delegation of the PML-Q, which was led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, and discussed the proposed constitutional amendment.
The PML-Q delegation also included Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan.
A day earlier, the MQM-P had demanded that local governments (LGs) be given autonomy in the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment after the PPP revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the PML-N-led government sought its support.
The party said that after provincial autonomy had been granted under the 18th Amendment of 2010, the “next step naturally is local autonomy, so it’s turn must come”.
“The important thing that we also said at the time of the 26th Amendment, that our constitutional amendment package be included,” MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said yesterday during a presser, referring to its agreement with the PML-N to empower local governments.
“But it did not happen,” he lamented, calling for the matter to be included in the 27th Amendment.
The government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation.
The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.</p><small>2025-11-06 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06145627c53230e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953505/fia-director-general-says-looking-into-reports-of-workers-being-offloaded-at-airports' target='_blank'><strong>FIA director general says looking into reports of workers being offloaded at airports</strong></a><br><p>Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar said on Thursday that the agency is investigating reports of workers being offloaded at airports, during a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, a statement from the ministry said.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
The development took place during a high-level meeting today presided over by the minister, in which he was briefed on such incidents. DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance.
DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
“If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them.”
While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates.
“Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement.
Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy.
The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future.
Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer.
A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure.
Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs).
In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office.
A high-level committee was formed to examine the tragedy, overseen by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. In January of this year, the former FIA DG, Ahmed Ishaque Jehangir, was removed from his position and Mukhtar appointed to replace him in early April.</p><small>2025-11-06 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632413-pakistan-rejects-afghanistans-claim-over-chaman-border-clash' target='_blank'><strong>'Ceasefire remains intact', says Pakistan after Afghan firing at Chaman border</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to reporters in Karachi outside the Bilawal House, Marri said that her party will never take away the rights given to provinces.
“When it comes to provinces, the PPP has a very clear stance […] the Pakistan Peoples Party wants to see the strengthening of the provinces, and it will never take away its rights or agree to proposals that may [compromise its rights],” she said.
However, she added that if any constitutional amendments could improve Pakistan’s governance system, enhance institutional performance, and deliver greater relief to citizens, the PPP would be open to considering and supporting such proposals.
“There are fears and speculations that there will be discussions [today] regarding the 18th Amendment or the NFC share. The PPP has a very clear stance on this — we will never step back. Rolling back the 18th Amendment is simply not possible. If the government seeks the PPP’s support, we will not be part of any such move.”
The PPP will shortly hold a meeting of its Central Executive Committee (CEC) at the Bilawal House to discuss the proposed 27th Amendment.
Regarding the CEC meeting, Marri said: “This meeting was not on the schedule, but matters were brought forward that prompted us to call the meeting.”
“The PPP Chairman made an X post on November 3, in which he said that the prime minister met him with a PML-N delegation, in which they discussed the 27th Amendment and proposals were put forward.
“They asked for the PPP’s backing on these proposals, but as you know, the PPP’s procedure is very structured,” Marri added. “We will bring all of these matters to the party forums along with legal teams. The chairman has said that he would bring these proposals to the PPP’s highest forum, the Central Executive Committee.”
 






Marri stated that the president and PPP chairman both returned from a trip to Qatar, saying that their flight landed in Karachi. “The meeting will commence upon their arrival at Bilawal House,” she said.
When asked about the proposals given to the PPP, Marri said that they would be discussed in tonight’s meeting.
“We will find out what has been discussed tonight,” she replied. “It’s wrong to cast judgment on points that you have not heard. If there is any change or improvisation [sic] in the system that improves the lives of the people, then there is no issue in listening.”
The spokesperson added that she could only speak about the points mentioned by Bilawal in his posts on social media, reiterating that the details from the meeting and “authentic news” would be shared with the press.
“If we need to discuss matters from today’s meeting further, then we can extend the session,” she added. “We will not be finishing this meeting within a couple of hours.”
On November 3, Bilawal took to X and revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the PML-N-led government sought its support.
“Proposal includes: setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP,” he wrote.
 






‘Attack on House’
A day earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the parliament, termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said that he and his party would continue to raise their voices against it.
“Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs,” he had said.
The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
Meanwhile, responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
Chaudhry also denounced the attempts to make the 27th amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.</p><small>2025-11-06 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06190047d32a144.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953504/kp-cm-afridi-unable-to-meet-imran-ihc-chief-justice' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi unable to meet Imran, IHC chief justice</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Thursday that he was unable to meet the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) earlier today and was denied permission to meet PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former premier, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, since he was sworn in as the KP CM on October 15. He has been denied access to the PTI founder at least four times since then, despite the IHC’s directives to implement its March order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran.
Addressing reporters outside the prison, CM Afridi lamented that he was unable to meet the party founder and the chief justice of the IHC, the latter of whom he had waited 90 minutes to meet before leaving empty-handed.
“As you all know, there have been continuous efforts through constitutional and legal means; this is the fifth time,” he said, referring to how frequently he was denied a meeting with the PTI founder.
“After waiting for an hour and a half, we couldn’t meet the IHC chief justice, so we came here. I was again denied permission for a meeting [with Imran]. You are seeing this system in place, which was exposed by my leader, Imran Khan.”
He said that people with “clouded judgment” levelled allegations that the PTI was trying to incite and protest, but stated that he has “continuously tried to remove the fog clouding their judgment”.
“Some people have become more powerful than institutions, because people are telling us they cannot do anything unless they receive orders from the top,” CM Afridi said, adding that he did not know who was issuing the orders.
 






The PTI earlier staged a protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the multiple denials of CM Afridi’s jail meeting with Imran. The KP CM reached the IHC for “legal proceedings”, after which he would head to the Adiala jail to meet Imran, the PTI said on X.
 






The move comes a day after the PTI parliamentary party unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Afridi and Imran. The PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the IHC in letter and spirit.
Speaking to reporters outside the court today, CM Afridi said he would “avail all legal and constitutional paths” to secure a meeting with Imran. The PTI leader has the option to file a petition against the Adiala jail administration for contempt of court proceedings — a move he has warned of previously.
The chief minister said he came to the IHC to meet Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and to discuss the fixation of some cases for hearing. “Our cases are not being fixed,” he claimed.
“I have not been allowed to meet the PTI founder despite court orders,” the KP CM said, asserting that the Constitution guaranteed him the right to protest. “Only the courts can tell who is pressuring them,” he added.
On the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, the PTI leader wondered “whether the government itself has seen its draft or not”.
 






Meanwhile, PTI parliamentarians and leaders also staged a protest outside the IHC.
They chanted various slogans, including “One state, two constitutions unacceptable”, “Make the judiciary independent/free the judiciary”, and “Free Imran Khan”.
 






Videos showed PTI leaders gathered at at least two spots, with one group also chanting slogans against the proposed 27th Amendment.
 






Pictures shared by the PTI’s KP chapter showed huge crowds of party workers welcoming the chief minister upon his arrival at the IHC.
Meeting denials
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not meet the imprisoned ex-premier again.
 
 

The KP CM then visited Rawalpindi on October 28 but was denied access to Imran for the third time, compelling the PTI founder to issue directives that Afridi pick his KP cabinet.
Afridi again was not able to meet Imran on October 30, marking the fourth such occurrence, following which he finally named his provincial cabinet.</p><small>2025-11-06 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061932481f4fd76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953524/fo-dismisses-indian-reports-on-hindus-denial-of-entry-on-religious-ground' target='_blank'><strong>FO dismisses Indian reports on Hindus’ denial of entry on religious ground</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday rejected “unfounded and misleading” allegations that members of the Hindu community were denied entry into the country on religious grounds, clarifying the action was “purely administrative” and consistent with Islamabad’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory.
Earlier this week, Pakistan welcomed Sikh pilgrims from India, with over 2,000 pilgrims granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith.
However, Indian media claimed yesterday that an Indian national and six family members were reportedly denied entry into Pakistan, with officials allegedly citing their Hindu faith as the reason for refusal.
In a statement today, FO said that these claims are “entirely baseless and represent yet another attempt to distort facts and politicise a matter that was purely administrative in nature”.
 






“High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi, had issued over 2,400 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India to participate in the celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji from November 4 to 13,” FO’s statement noted.
“On November 4, a total of 1,932 pilgrims successfully crossed into Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border,” the statement highlighted. “It is pertinent to note that approximately 300 visa holders were prevented by the Indian authorities from crossing over. The entire immigration process on the Pakistani side was smooth, orderly, and free of any hindrance.”
It added that a very small number of individuals were “found to possess incomplete documentation and were unable to provide satisfactory responses to immigration authorities”.
Consequently, the statement noted, “they were requested to return to the Indian side in accordance with standard procedures”.
“To suggest that these individuals were denied entry on religious grounds is completely incorrect and mischievous,” according to FO.
“Pakistan has always welcomed pilgrims of all faiths to visit its sacred religious sites under a well-established and facilitative framework. The action taken was purely administrative, consistent with Pakistan’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory,” said FO, adding that any attempt to give this issue a communal or political colour is not only regrettable but “also reflective of the prejudiced mindset that increasingly dominates the Indian government and media narratives”.</p><small>2025-11-06 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632404-political-leaders-rally-in-full-swing-as-govt-pushes-for-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Political leaders rally in full swing as govt pushes for 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, the word refers to “an emerging software development that turns natural language into computer code using AI”, according to Collins Dictionary.
“It’s programming by vibes, not variables,” said Collins.
“While tech experts debate whether it’s revolutionary or reckless, the term has resonated far beyond Silicon Valley, speaking to a broader cultural shift towards AI-assisted everything in everyday life,” it added.
Lexicographers at Collins Dictionary monitor the 24 billion-word Collins Corpus, which draws from a range of media sources, including social media, to create the annual list of new and notable words that reflect our ever-evolving language.
 
 

The 2025 shortlist highlights a range of words that have emerged in the past year to pithily reflect the changing world around us.
“Broligarchy” made the list in a year that saw tech billionaire Elon Musk briefly at the heart of US President Donald Trump’s administration and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos cosying up to the president.
The word is defined as a small clique of very wealthy men who exert political influence.
‘Coolcation’
New words linked to work and technology include “clanker”, a derogatory term for a computer, robot or source of artificial intelligence, and “HENRY”, an acronym for “high earner, not rich yet”.
Another is “taskmasking”, the act of giving a false impression that one is being productive in the workplace, while “micro-retirement” refers to a break taken between periods of employment to pursue personal interests.
In the health and behavioural sphere, “biohacking” also gets a spot, meaning the activity of altering the natural processes of one’s body in an attempt to improve one’s health and longevity.
Also listed is “aura farming” (the deliberate cultivation of a distinctive and charismatic persona) and the verb “to glaze” (to praise or flatter someone excessively or undeservedly).
 
 

Although the list is dominated by words linked to technology and employment, one from the world of leisure bags a spot — “coolcation”, meaning a holiday in a place with a cool climate.
Last year’s word of the year was “Brat”, the name of UK singer Charli XCX’s hit sixth album, signifying a “confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude” rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.</p><small>2025-11-06 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0615235165b5b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953507/president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-dismissed-from-pia-service-amid-ongoing-tiff' target='_blank'><strong>President, secretary general of aircraft engineers’ body dismissed from PIA service amid ongoing tiff</strong></a><br><p>Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service on Thursday amid an ongoing tiff with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn. The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn.
Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII).
The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general, for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images.
“In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said.
“After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so.
“Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately.
 
 

The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days.
The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials.
While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks.
Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned.
For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.”
He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.
Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation.
Flight disruptions
The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier.
Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months.
On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations.
Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061801444a84dbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953515/federal-govt-accepts-ptis-invitation-to-kp-peace-jirga' target='_blank'><strong>Federal govt accepts PTI’s invitation to KP peace jirga</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Frontier Affairs Amir Muqam announced on Thursday that the federal government would take part in the upcoming peace jirga called by the PTI.
The announcement was made as Muqam held a joint press conference alongside PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser in Islamabad.
Earlier this week, the PTI decided to convene a peace jirga in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly (KPA) on November 12 to discuss the volatile law and order situation in the province.
“We have conveyed our requests to the federal government and are grateful that they accepted our invitation,” Qaiser said while jointly addressing reporters after the meeting.
“We have come together and we know what policy we want. Whatever it is, the province’s people and leadership need to come together to create a concerted plan of action,” he added.
In response to a question, Muqam said that the PTI presented “the reason why we are here” and that the government accepted it.
“They said they wanted peace and that we are all one,” he added.
Meanwhile, Qaiser wrote a post on X announcing that a delegation he led also met with National Awami Party Chairman Aftab Sherpao today.
“The delegation invited Aftab Ahmad Sherpao to attend the peace jirga organised by the KP provincial government on November 12,” he wrote.
 






In another post, Qaiser wrote that Sherpao was an “important leader of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and has also served as chief minister”.
“We desire that he inform the provincial government of his views and experiences. Peace and security are our common issues, which transcend politics,” Qaiser wrote.
 






ANP to hold ‘consultations’ before accepting jirga invitation
President of the ANP’s KP chapter, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that he will hold consultations and then inform the PTI and the press about accepting the invitation to the peace jirga.
He made these remarks at a joint press conference flanked by PTI leader and Adviser to the KP chief minister, Shafiullah Jan.
“The jirga we held was successful and we formed an organising committee with all political parties,” he said in response to a question. “To look after it, we implemented a procedure.
“When we called an All-Parties Conference, we made a decision, and the ANP called another conference in Islamabad,” he added. “After the floods, we decided to suspend that decision under the situation improved.”

Hussain said that there has been no contact with some parties, adding that ANP President Aimal Wali Khan told KP CM Afridi that the party would only make a decision after consultations.
“We are grateful for their (the PTI) invitation and we will reply once we have had consultations,” he stated. “You will find out who is going [to the jirga].”
The PTI’s KP Secretary General, Ali Asghar Khan, took the floor and said that the previous jirga was called by the chief minister, and the party had reservations about being part of a jirga with the federal government.
“This time, the jirga has been called by the [KP] speaker,” he stated. “He formed a committee and will hold meetings with parliamentarians from all parties. He has done so because we, as a party, have come to extend the speaker’s invitation and to ask that you positively respond.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061729307bc7522.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953492/british-army-chief-meets-coas-munir-both-discuss-enhancing-bilateral-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>British army chief meets COAS Munir; both discuss enhancing bilateral defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The British Army’s Chief of the General Staff (CGS) Gen Sir Charles Roland Vincent Walker on Thursday met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed boosting bilateral defence cooperation.
The meeting between the army chiefs took place at the General Headquarters (GHQ), a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security and measures to further enhance bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” it said.
“Both sides reiterated the need for continued collaboration to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the military’s media affairs wing added.

Gen Walker “appreciated Pakistan Army’s achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and its efforts for regional peace and stability”, according to the ISPR.
Upon his arrival at the GHQ, the British CGS laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada to pay homage to the martyrs. He was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.
 






The field marshal’s meeting today comes about two weeks after his visit to Egypt, where he held discussions with the Egyptian Armed Forces’ Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ahmed Khalifa Fatehi and Minister of Defence and Defence Production Gen Abdul Maged Saqar.
COAS Munir had last met with Gen Walker during his five-day official visit to the United Kingdom in February, where he attended and delivered a keynote address at the annual 7th Regional Stabilisation Conference at the Royal Military Academy in Sandh­urst.
During his visit, the army chief had also engaged with the UK’s then-chief of defence staff Admiral Toney Radikin and National Security Adv­i­ser Jonathan Nicholas Powell, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss shared security challenges and the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two nations.
 
 

In May 2024, then-CGS Gen Sir Patrick Sanders had paid a visit to Pakistan, where he met COAS Munir, with Gen Walker present as well as the CGS-designate. Gen Sanders had also addressed the sixth Pakistan-UK Regional Stabilisation Conference at Islamabad’s National Defence University.
COAS Munir and then-CGS Gen Sanders had also met in May 2023 as the latter visited Rawalpindi, where he acknowledged the Pakistan Army’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
CJCSC vows to boost defence cooperation with Brunei
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has held meetings with the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other officials during an official visit to the country, expressing the commitment to “further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”, the ISPR said today.

According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M.

The ban, which the federation imposed on Salman on October 12 “for gross violations of the AFP Constitution”, barred Salman from participating in any athletics activity “whether as an athlete, coach, official, or office bearer, at both national and international levels, inside or outside Pakistan.”
AFP cited “illegal and unconstitutional” elections held on August 31 by the Punjab Athletics Association — of which Salman was president till August 6 — as the primary reason for the ban.
The ban came just days after AFP asked Salman to explain Arshad’s 10th-place finish at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.
The matter descended into the legal sphere when Salman approached the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Oct 14 to hear the case that he was appealing. PSB appointed Senator Pervaiz Rashid as adjudicator to the case.
According to a notice of hearing on the matter, a copy of which Dawn has seen, Rashid sent a questionnaire to AFP and held the first hearing on November 3, but the federation objected to the matter being sent to an adjudicator instead of arbitration.
PSB, citing its constitution, as well as hearings from both the Supreme Court and Islamabad High Court, said it “possesses ample jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide the present matter”, and that the objection raised by AFP regarding jurisdiction was “rejected and set aside.”
The notice of hearing directed all parties to appear for the next hearing on Nov 6 (today), but after the AFP requested more time, the hearing has been scheduled for Nov 13 instead, a source close to the matter told Dawn.
Separately, Arshad had written to the Pakistan Olympics Association (POA) on Oct 17, who in turn confirmed its continued support and safeguarding oversight.
Arshad was a recipient of the POA’s Olympic Scholarships for athletes bound for the Paris 2024 Olympics, where Arshad won gold and broke the Olympic record with a 92.97m throw.
In the POA’s response to Arshad, a copy of which Dawn has seen, it confirmed that Salman “as per your patent right, preference and performance record, shall continue to serve as your Athlete Support Personnel for all training, rehabilitation, and competition activities including those conducted under the Pakistan Olympic Association and within the scope of the IOC Olympic Solidarity Programme.”
The association reaffirmed its full commitment to Arshad’s “professional development, mental welfare, and safeguarding.
“You will continue to train and compete within a safe, dignified environment free from external interference,” the letter read.
It further stated that a follow-up consultation would be convened to review his ongoing and future programmes, and the IOC would be informed of the situation “to protect your rights under the Olympic Charter and, in consultation with you, jointly engage with World Athletics at the appropriate time.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632381-pia-dismisses-president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-amid-ongoing-dispute' target='_blank'><strong>PIA dismisses president, secretary general of aircraft engineers' body amid ongoing dispute</strong></a><br><p>

The top market for US farmers, China has turned its vast appetite for crops into a powerful trade war bargaining chip, largely avoiding US wheat and soybeans in favour of other supplies, after rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs.
Chinese buyers have booked two cargoes of US wheat, the first such purchases since October last year, two traders said on Thursday, while a sorghum shipment has been sent from the US to China, a US industry official said.
The deals to import US agricultural goods come as Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that it suspended retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including duties on farm goods, although shipments of US soybeans still face a 13 per cent tariff.
Soft white and spring wheat cargoes
The purchases of about 120,000 tonnes for December shipment include one cargo of US soft white wheat and one of spring wheat, the sources said.
 
 

“This is more of China showing commitment to buy US grains as US wheat is not the cheapest,” said a Singapore-based grains trader with direct knowledge of the wheat deals. “So it is more of [a] political move to buy these cargoes.”
On Thursday, Chinese state grains buyer COFCO held a soybean procurement signing ceremony during a major import fair in Shanghai, the head of a Chinese agriculture business association said, but no details were given.
Cheaper Brazilian soybeans
The White House has said China would buy at least 12m tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025 and at least 25m tonnes in each of the next three years, but Beijing has yet to confirm those figures.
China’s decision to leave intact a tariff of 13pc on soybeans makes US shipments too expensive for commercial buyers compared to Brazilian cargoes, traders and analysts said.
Chinese importers recently bought 20 cargoes of cheaper Brazilian soybeans as South American prices eased on expectations that US sales would resume, while COFCO took three US cargoes ahead of the Trump-Xi meet.</p><small>2025-11-06 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06162024b16fbed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953510/bangladesh-election-campaign-turns-violent-as-1-killed-in-shooting-at-rally-of-khaleda-zias-party' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh election campaign turns violent as 1 killed in shooting at rally of Khaleda Zia’s party</strong></a><br><p>Gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, officials said on Thursday, after parties began campaigning for landmark elections.
Major parties opened their campaigns on Wednesday for the elections slated for February 2026, the first since a deadly uprising last year toppled the autocratic government of former ruler Sheikh Hasina.
Campaigning turned violent almost immediately.
The shooting took place at a rally on Wednesday for the powerful Bangladesh National Party (BNP) attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.
Senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said, “It was an attempt to destabilise politics and disrupt the election”.
Major parties have unveiled their candidate lists, with the BNP saying this week that 80-year-old leader and three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia will run again, as well as her son, Tarique Rahman.
The BNP are widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls.
Police said the gunmen opened fire quickly on a crowd of hundreds at the rally but insisted that the BNP candidate was not the target.
“The miscreants … shot their target, and fled in a flash,” senior police officer Hasib Aziz told reporters late on Wednesday.
Candidate Ershad Ullah was shot and wounded, along with a supporter. A third man was killed.
“We would urge candidates to inform the police station at least 24 hours prior to any election campaign, so that more police can be deployed,” Aziz said.
‘Show restraint’
The South Asian nation of about 170 million people has been in political turmoil since Hasina was overthrown by the student-led uprising in August 2024.
Campaigning is technically unofficial because the election commission is not expected to announce the voting day until December.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner serving as chief adviser, has repeatedly promised the elections will be held in February.
Yunus has ordered an investigation into the shooting, his media team said in a statement.
The interim government “calls on all political actors and their supporters to uphold calm, show restraint, and ensure that the February general election takes place in an atmosphere of peace, dignity, and fairness”, it said on Thursday.
Bangladesh police offered cash rewards yesterday for the surrender of more than 1,300 machine guns, rifles and pistols looted during last year’s uprising.
Lieutenant General Md Mainur Rahman told an army news conference on Wednesday that the military would provide security to ensure peaceful polls and that they would return to barracks after the election.
“We hope stability will be strengthened, law and order will remain normal, and we will return to the cantonment once the election is held,” Rahman said.
Bangladesh’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-i-Islami, said it had finalised a preliminary candidate list and was “engaging with other parties on the prospect of seat-sharing”, senior leader Abdullah Mohammad Taher told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-06 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632376-controversial-tweet-case-court-withdraws-imaan-mazari-husbands-warrants' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial tweet case: Court withdraws Imaan Mazari, husband's warrants</strong></a><br><p>

Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
Focus of the talks
A joint statement was released by the Turkish foreign ministry following the last round of talks between the two sides. It said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose a penalty on the violating party”.
The communique further stated that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to discuss implementation.
Earlier, a diplomat from one of the mediating countries said while speaking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
Meanwhile, officials in both Islamabad and Kabul have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan — a longstanding demand of Islamabad.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week.
Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said while speaking to Dawn that Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
From borders clashes to talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on Oct 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister had said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar had stated.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6 (today).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06152256b1c233f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953506/islamabad-court-withdraws-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-issued-against-imaan-mazari-spouse' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court withdraws non-bailable arrest warrants issued against Imaan Mazari, spouse</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court on Thursday withdrew non-bailable arrest warrants issued a day earlier against human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a social media posts case, a day after.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.  Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case last week, in which both denied the charges.
At yesterday’s hearing, the court issued non-bailable arrest warrants to the couple over repeated non-appearance. However, the accused alleged that they had appeared in front of the court and termed the hearing a “sham trial”.
Today’s hearing, presided over by ADSJ Majoka, was called twice in the morning —first at 8:45am and later at 10:16am— but the accused did not appear, after which the hearing was adjourned.
However, later, the couple appeared before the court, and the hearing resumed.  During the hearing, Mazari requested the court to allow her time to hire legal counsel.
“Time should be given to appoint a lawyer,” she said, adding that the rapid pace at which the case was being conducted was “violating our rights.”
She further stated, “We are being punished for speaking the truth.”
Mazari also requested that the indictment be read out to them in court.
In response to this, ADSJ Majoka said that the indictment had already been read three times, including in the presence of legal representatives.
Chattha — whose power of attorney had been submitted earlier by Advocate Samiullah Wazir — also requested the court to remove the state counsel appointed for him.
To this, the court clarified that it had not appointed the state counsel and that only the relevant committee responsible for the appointment could remove them if required.
On the other side, the prosecutor was against granting the accused any more time. He went on to argue that statements of witnesses should be recorded and, if necessary, a state counsel could continue representing the accused.
On the matter of Mazari’s legal representation, ADSJ Majoka directed that the power of attorney for Mazari’s counsel be submitted on Saturday.
He adjourned the hearing to Saturday as well.
He also stated that arguments regarding the continuation or removal of the state counsel will also be heard on Saturday, after which the court will decide the matter.
Over the appearance of both of the accused, the court suspended the arrest warrants against the couple.
Separately, in a post on X, Mazari alleged that “she had only been given one day to hire legal counsel,” adding that “charges against them had not yet formally been framed.”
She further alleged that “despite Hadi submitting power of attorney, the court remained persistent that he should be represented by state counsel.”
Mazari went on to note: “The court adjourned the hearing to Saturday in this case, while many other trials usually stretch on for 2-3 weeks.”
 






In a separate tweet detailing yesterday’s hearing, Mazari had alleged that the judge had  “flatly refused” to read the charges to her.
He “[began] recording of evidence without charge being framed and my plea,” she added.
Mazari continued: “This is not an independent or impartial court but a party to the case. The bias is clear, and this Judge should no longer hear this case.
“This is a sham trial.”
 






At yesterday’s hearing, heated exchanges took place between the accused and the court.
Mazari objected to the court’s previous order, calling it “baseless” and claiming that the record incorrectly stated she had been indicted.  As the hearing resumed after a brief adjournment, Chatha expressed no confidence in the court, alleging bias.
“This court is biased and should not hear this case,” he said.
ADSJ Majoka replied that such an application should have been filed before the indictment. “Had you expressed no confidence before the indictment, I could have transferred the case. Now, this power lies with the High Court,” the judge remarked.
Chatha then alleged that the judge was “under pressure,” which the judge firmly denied.
On October 29, Chattha was arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Social media case
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the NCIA, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts.
It also accused the two of implying that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR was registered under the following sections of law: Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06130407e5f6539.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953498/only-sohail-afridi-can-make-decisions-for-peace-in-kp-says-cms-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Only Sohail Afridi can make decisions for peace in KP, says CM’s aide</strong></a><br><p>Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province.
“We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar.
 






He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue.
Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province.
Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province.
“The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said.
The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations.
Imran had made a similar demand in September as well.
However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military.
It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP.
Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership.
In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations?
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents.
In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.</p><small>2025-11-06 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632356-sindh-launches-student-attendance-system-to-enhance-school-management' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches student attendance system to enhance school management</strong></a><br><p>

SAMRS, an initiative of the school education and literacy department (SELD), has been developed under the Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation (SELECT) project. It will be rolled out in 600 schools across 12 districts.
In a statement on X, the Sindh information department said the initiative represented a “significant step toward greater transparency and the promotion of data-driven education across the province”.
 






Addressing the launch ceremony in Karachi today, CM Murad stressed the need for Pakistan to have proper databases due to an increase in the population. “The numbers have become so large that you can’t just keep track.”
Underscoring the need to utilise digital platforms, the chief minister said the SAMRS was the “perfect way of doing it”.
“I have said that we will go to the union councils and make it the responsibility of elected representatives to identify children in their villages to assign them a digital ID,” CM Murad said.
Murad noted that the SAMRS has been rolled out in 600 schools as of now, while the province had a total of more than 40,000 schools.
Stressing that each and every child should be incorporated into the SAMRS, the chief minister proposed that the subsequent data should be compared with that of the latest census.
He said the system would be used to gauge the number of out-of-school children, acknowledging that the current reported figures were “scary to say the least”.
CM Murad noted that the SAMRS will also aid in figuring out the number of school dropouts. Last month, he had directed the school education department to make full use of the technology to monitor students’ attendance, reduce dropout rate and address the causes of absenteeism.
Sindh had a 54pc dropout rate for children at the post-primary level in 2024, according to government figures, while 47pc of children across the province — a staggering 7.81 million — were out of school as per the 2023 census.
 
 

The chief minister highlighted the importance of educating children to create a well-civilised and democratic nation.
“Our mines, our minerals, our arms and ammunition — they all go to zero if we don’t have an educated nation,” CM Murad said.
He said the system will first be implemented in schools, then colleges and eventually universities. He also called for “open access” to the system so that educationists and experts can provide their input.
CM Murad noted that the SELECT project was being carried out in collaboration with the World Bank, and the SAMRS was a part of it. He added that the Asian Development Bank and other international agencies were aiding in rebuilding schools.
 






“We’re going to spend more than Rs125 billion this year in rebuilding schools that were affected during the floods,” the chief minister stated.
Murad noted that there had been grievances that the education department was not implementing its development portfolio properly, but “we have seen an improvement compared to last year”. “Still not satisfied, still a long way to go, but yes, it has become better.”
Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and World Bank Country Director in Pakistan Bolormaa Amgaabazar were among the attendees at the event.
Shah, as per a statement from CM Murad’s spokesperson Abdulrasheed Channa, said teachers will be trained in the initial stages of SELECT to improve teaching quality and that a transparent system will be implemented under the supervision of a Reform Support Unit.
On the SAMRS, Shah said the reasons for students’ absences will be identified and “timely corrective action” will be taken.
He pointed out that the SAMRS would also enable online monitoring of teachers’ attendance and registration. He added that the system will have “full functionality” with geo-fencing and an offline mode.
 


Providing details of the SAMRS, the minister said out of the 600 schools where the system was initially being rolled out, 120 were primary, 480 were middle, and 79 were high schools.
“There are a total of 137,000 pupils registered, including 79,730 girls and 57,501 boys,” Shah said. He listed that illness was the top reason for absenteeism (44 per cent), followed by domestic circumstances (21pc) and family emergencies (16pc).
According to the education minister, there has been a 16pc improvement in school attendance from April to May this year, while the share of students with “high risk” of dropping out has declined from 32.5pc to 23pc.</p><small>2025-11-06 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632352-pm-shehbaz-assures-mqm-p-of-local-govt-reforms-under-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz assures MQM-P of local govt reforms under 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Cathay said late on Wednesday that the Doha-based carrier had approached it about selling its entire 9.7 per cent stake, and it would repurchase the shareholding through a buyback at HK$10.8374 per share, roughly a 4pc discount to its last closing share price.
The Gulf carrier had bought the stake in November 2017, making it the third-largest shareholder in Cathay after Swire Pacific and Air China.
Cathay is paying roughly a 35pc premium over the price Qatar Airways originally paid for the stake to buy it back. The Hong Kong carrier said it would fund the deal through internal resources and existing credit lines.
“I don’t think there’s anything special to read into it [buying back from Qatar]. I think it’s more likely about Qatar Airways having their own cash needs,” said Kenny Ng Lai-yin, securities strategist at China Everbright Securities International.
 

A Cathay Pacific A350 flies low over Hong Kong’s urban area near Kai Tak Sports Park, built on the site of the former Kai Tak Airport, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its opening during the Rugby Sevens in Hong Kong, China on March 30, 2025. — Reuters/File

Kenny said the deal should be good for Cathay’s stock price as there would be fewer shares floating in the market, which would mean less selling pressure.
Shares of Cathay rose 4.8pc on Thursday, while the Hong Kong-listed shares of Air China climbed 4pc and Swire Pacific’s stock was up more than 1pc.
Based at the world’s busiest cargo airport, Cathay is one of Asia’s largest cargo carriers and has benefited from rising volumes of e-commerce out of China.
Exit strategy allows for ‘long-term growth’
Cathay was Qatar Airways’ first major investment in an Asian airline and was aimed at boosting its global influence and increasing traffic through its Doha hub. There were no Qatar-nominated directors on Cathay’s board, meaning it had little influence over the Swire Pacific-managed airline.
Prior to Qatar Airways’ investment, Cathay flew between Hong Kong and Qatar’s Doha hub as part of a codeshare arrangement between 2014 and 2016, but the route was axed “for commercial reasons”.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said the exit reflected the company’s disciplined portfolio strategy and followed a period of strong results, allowing the company to optimise investments and position itself for long-term growth.
The Middle Eastern airline has pursued a strategy of investing in airlines worldwide to strengthen its competitive position, including in British Airways parent IAG, South American carrier LATAM and Virgin Australia .
Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy said the stake buyback reflected “strong” confidence in the company’s future. The airline has laid out an investment plan of HK$100bn over seven years that includes fleet renewal, cabin products and lounges.
Cathay suffered prolonged losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, with Hong Kong one of the last global destinations to end travel restrictions.
 
 

Cathay’s business is recovering, with the airline and budget subsidiary HK Express carrying 20pc more passengers in September than a year earlier.
If the buyback of the Qatar Airways stake is approved, Swire Pacific’s stake in Cathay will rise to 47.69pc from 43.12pc, while Air China’s shareholding will increase to 31.78pc from 28.74pc.
Cathay and Qatar Airways said they would continue their partnership through the oneworld Alliance.</p><small>2025-11-06 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632334-govt-finalising-27th-amendment-draft-with-key-defence-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Govt finalising 27th Amendment draft with key 'defence reforms'</strong></a><br><p>

“In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday.
“I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said.
 


He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace.
“I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said.
“A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06112308e225cac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953488/trump-administration-has-revoked-80000-non-immigrant-visas-us-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration has revoked 80,000 non-immigrant visas, US official says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since its inauguration on January 20 for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday.
The extent of the revocations, first reported by the Washington Examiner, reflects a broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump came into office, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants, including some who held valid visas.
The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said the senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.
The department also said last month that it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May said he had revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, including students, because of involvement in activities that he said went against US foreign policy priorities.
Directives from the State Department this year have ordered US diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.
Trump administration officials have said that student visa and green card holders are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s conduct in its offensive in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to US foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</p><small>2025-11-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0610164365090d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953480/elon-musks-starlink-to-start-services-in-indias-maharashtra-state' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk’s Starlink to start services in India’s Maharashtra state</strong></a><br><p>India’s Maharashtra state, home to the financial hub Mumbai, will be the first to roll out Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service in the world’s most populous country, the state’s chief minister said.
The launch of Starlink, which provides high-speed internet to remote locations using low-orbit satellites, has sparked fierce debate in India over issues ranging from predatory pricing to spectrum allocation.
India — projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end — granted Starlink a licence in June.
Maharashtra was “poised to become the first Indian state to formally collaborate with Starlink”, the state’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on the Musk-owned platform X late Wednesday.
“This collaboration … will ensure the state leads India in satellite-enabled digital infrastructure.”
In March, India’s biggest telecom service providers — Jio Platforms and its rival Bharti Airtel — announced deals with SpaceX to offer Starlink internet to their customers.
Starlink’s business operations Vice President Lauren Dreyer said she was “excited” to further India’s digital vision.
“Looking forward to connecting schools, medical facilities, and beyond in the most remote and unconnected areas once Starlink receives final approvals”, Dreyer said in a statement.
Major technology firms looking to court users in the world’s fifth-largest economy have made a flurry of announcements about expanding into the country this year.
In October, Google announced it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years to build a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base there, the largest AI hub it is investing in outside of the United States.
US companies Anthropic, OpenAI are both planning Indian offices, while Perplexity announced a major partnership in July with Indian telecom giant Airtel.</p><small>2025-11-06 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632312-pakistan-afghan-taliban-regime-set-to-hold-next-round-of-truce-talks-in-istanbul-today' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghan Taliban begin third round of talks in Istanbul</strong></a><br><p>
