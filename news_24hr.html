Trzaskowski, who is backed by the governing centrists, will face nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki in the June 1 run-off vote.
An overall victory for Trzaskowski as head of state would be a boost for the centrist government led by former European Union leader Donald Tusk, which has been at loggerheads with the current nationalist president.
A Nawrocki win would probably extend the political deadlock in the Central European country of 38 million people, which is a member of NATO and the EU.
Analysts predict that fresh parliamentary elections may have to be called.
With all ballots counted, the national election commission said Trzaskowski won 31.36 per cent against 29.54pc for Nawrocki in Sunday’s first round.
The razor-thin margin between the two sets the stage for a fierce electoral campaign in which each will try to woo the supporters of the many third-party candidates.
The far-right showed strong gains, with its two candidates receiving a combined 21.15pc.
“This brings Nawrocki into a favourable position… He will have a larger pool of votes to draw upon,” analyst Piotr Buras said.
That suggests the key to the run-off will be whether the far-right’s supporters decide to cast their ballots for Nawrocki in the second round.
“The campaign in the next two weeks will be very polarising and brutal — a confrontation of two visions of Poland: pro-EU, liberal and progressive versus nationalist, Trumpist and conservative,” said the head of the Warsaw-based ECFR think tank.
Poland’s president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, steers foreign policy and can introduce and veto legislation.
The two run-off candidates have diverging views on abortion and LGBTQ rights.
The election also comes at a fraught moment for Europe as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on and ties with Washington are under strain.
‘De-globalisation’
Turnout was over 67pc, which is high for Poland, though lower than the record turnout of the 2023 general election that brought the centrists to power.
Warsaw voter Iwona Lon said: “We had enormous expectations after that last election and they were dashed a bit.”
“I think it’s a signal for the government that people have lost patience,” the 47-year-old banker told AFP.
Tusk’s administration has been prevented from easing Poland’s stringent abortion laws and introducing other changes by President Andrzej Duda’s power of veto.
The governing coalition is hopeful a Trzaskowski victory would enable it to carry out undelivered campaign pledges.
On Monday, both run-off candidates immediately went for voters’ stomachs.
Trzaskowski handed out sweet rolls while Nawrocki offered doughnuts.
Nawrocki said he was “bursting with energy and optimism” after earlier calling on Slawomir Mentzen’s supporters to back him in the run-off.
Far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur who came in third in the ballot, is a eurosceptic libertarian staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants.
He has accused the country’s one million Ukrainians of taking advantage of Poland.
Trzaskowski said: “I’ll try to persuade all those who voted differently that it is worth casting a ballot for a normal Poland and not a radical Poland.” He added that he would focus “especially on the young generation”.
Young voter Kacper Karwacki said the far-right’s gains in Poland were “very worrisome” but to be expected.
“If you look at countries nearby – Germany, France, Britain – the far-right is gaining ground everywhere, benefitting from social issues,” the 24-year-old student told AFP.
Analyst Marcin Zaborowski said: “Poland is simply part of this trend. That is probably a consequence of new generations coming to vote… People who do not think that you need to fight for democracy.” The fellow at think tank Globsec also ascribed the far-right gains to the de-globalisation promoted by US President Donald Trump.
“The mood overall seems to be that the costs of globalisation are too big.
And people want to go back to what is local, what is familiar,” Zaborowski told AFP.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605196-fo-dismisses-indian-claims-of-pakistan-using-shaheen-missile-in-operation-bunyan-um-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>FO dismisses Indian claims of Pakistan using Shaheen missiles in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos</strong></a><br><p>

New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
A day earlier, the Indian army claimed that Pakistan launched a nuclear-capable Shaheen missile at India during the intense shelling, News Arena India reported. A video released by the Indian army allegedly showed the use of the Shaheen missile during the recent crossfire, according to NDTV.
In a statement today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has firmly rejected the unfounded allegations circulating in certain segments of the Indian media, which falsely claim that Pakistan employed the Shaheen missile during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.”
He said that the Indian army deleted the “misleading video” after realising that the claim was “unsubstantiated”.
“Regrettably, some Indian outlets continue to propagate this misinformation,” he added.
The Indian army’s official account remained silent on the matter, “offering neither clarification nor retraction for the erroneous post”, according to the FO spokesperson.
The statement cited analysts, who observed that “such disinformation campaigns” were part of “a deliberate attempt to obscure India’s setbacks in Operation Sindoor”.
“These fabricated stories align with New Delhi’s ongoing efforts to promote a misleading narrative regarding the ceasefire and baseless allegations of so-called ‘nuclear blackmail’ by Pakistan.”
The FO spokesperson said, “Disseminating unverified and inflammatory content not only undermines regional stability but also reflects poorly on the professionalism of official institutions.”
On Sunday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19123149398908e.jpg?r=123210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911962/psx-hits-120000-barrier-to-reach-record-high-in-intraday-trade-before-losing-gains' target='_blank'><strong>PSX hits 120,000 barrier to reach record high in intraday trade before losing gains</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued last week’s renewed momentum and crossed the 120,000-point barrier to reach a record high during intraday trade on Monday before losing its gains to settle a little below.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 636.4 points, or 0.53 per cent, to stand at 120,285.54 points from the previous close of 119,649.14 points at 9:33am.
However, it witnessed fluctuation, dropping to 119,426.44 points at 11:44am, 222.70 points lower than the last close.
The market subsequently closed at 119,689.63 points, 40.49 points higher, or 0.03pc.
After the Pakistan-India ceasefire relieved investors’ worries, the PSX recorded a historic rebound last week as the KSE-100 Index gained 12,474 points to settle at 119,649 on Friday.
The bullish momentum in recent days has been further supported by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) approval of the first review of Pakistan’s loan programme and a climate fund, as well as the disbursement of a $1 billion tranche.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said the market was “consolidating ahead of the budget as participants evaluate the IMF review report”. The federal budget is expected on June 2.
 
 

He advised retail investors to “look past short-term market fluctuations and instead focus on spending less than they earn while consistently investing small amounts each month in line with their risk appetite and long-term goals”.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also noted that the IMF’s “recognition of Pakistan’s achievement in meeting all quantitative performance criteria and most indicative targets is likely to be viewed positively”.
However, he stated, “Investors remain cautious about the IMF’s push for a higher revenue target for the upcoming fiscal year, which the Federal Board of Revenue is also confident of.
“A strong external position, supported by a current account surplus and easing inflation, is expected to revive economic activity and create room for further monetary easing. This should enhance the appeal of equities relative to fixed-income instruments,” Ashraf pointed out.
 
 

Analysts forecast that the KSE-100 Index could reach 165,215 points by December 2025, supported by robust corporate earnings, consistent return on equity in banking stocks, and improved cash flows in the exploration and production and oil marketing sectors.
Falling interest rates and greater macroeconomic stability are also expected to provide tailwinds.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/682a796c82f4b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911908/the-agriculture-sectors-hidden-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>The agriculture sector’s hidden crisis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s agriculture sector is grappling with a deepening crisis, which is likely to worsen in the coming years. The prices of agricultural commodities have been on a consistent downward slide in international markets, and so have they in local markets.
Meanwhile, agricultural input prices in Pakistan continue to rise. This growing imbalance — rising production costs amid government claims of easing inflation, coupled with shrinking farm incomes — raises serious concerns about the long-term viability of farming in the country.
Global food inflation, triggered during the Covid-19 pandemic, is gradually subsiding. A review of the World Bank’s commodities price data over the past three years highlights this downward trend. Maize price, which stood at $319 per metric tonne (MT) in 2022 (annual average), has now dropped to $214 per MT in 2025 (Jan-March average). Similarly, the price of wheat has declined significantly, falling from $430 per MT in 2022 to $258 per MT in 2025.
The coarse variety of rice, which was priced at $524 per MT in 2023 and rose to $557 per MT in 2024, has now decreased to $409 per MT. Cotton has also witnessed a steady decline, dropping from $2.86 per kg in 2022 to $2.09 in 2023, further sliding to $1.91 in 2024, and maintaining this rate in early 2025. However, global sugar prices have remained stable. It was around $0.41 per kg in 2022 and hovering at the same level in early 2025.
But this story does not end with Pakistan’s five major crops. The prices of edible oilseeds have also seen a sharp decline. Likewise, in the horticulture sector, farmers have been forced to sell much of their vegetables at throwaway prices. A recent and glaring example is that of onions and tomatoes, where growers struggled to recover even their production costs.

Despite a global decline in input prices, the cost of agricultural inputs in Pakistan continues to rise, driven largely by heavy taxation, a depreciating rupee, and rampant profiteering by manufacturers

The situation could potentially worsen in the future. The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook (April 2025) projects a 10 per cent drop in global food prices this year, with further reductions likely in 2026, which will bring prices to their lowest level in six years.
Notably, while the prices of major crops are falling, the costs of key agricultural inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, and diesel have also been on a downward trend over the past three years in global markets.
For instance, the price of urea — the most widely used fertiliser — peaked at $925 per MT in April 2022 but has since dropped to $394 per MT. Likewise, the price of diammonium phosphate (DAP) — the second most used fertiliser — has fallen from $938 per MT to $615 MT over the same period. Potash has seen an even more dramatic decline, plunging from $1,202 to $336 per MT. Petroleum prices have also eased, decreasing from $86 per barrel in January 2022 to $61.7 in May 2025. Likewise, pesticide prices have also experienced a downward trend.
Ironically, despite this global decline in input prices, the cost of agricultural inputs in Pakistan has continued to rise. This surge is largely driven by heavy taxation, the depreciation of the Pakistani rupee, and rampant profiteering by manufacturers and suppliers of inputs.
Over the past three years, prices of fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, and tractors have doubled in the country. Meanwhile, electricity tariffs for tubewells have tripled, while diesel prices have surged by 70pc.
The combination of falling crop prices and rising input costs has significantly eroded farmers’ purchasing power. Tractor sales have dropped to just 25,143 units in 2024-25 (July-April), compared to 39,838 units during the same period last year. For context, Pakistan produced 58,880 tractors in 2021-22. This decline is particularly alarming given that the country’s level of farm mechanisation remains extremely low.
Likewise, high prices of DAP have already led to under-application of phosphate fertilisers. As a result, the nitrogen-to-phosphate usage ratio in Pakistan has skewed to 3.8:1, compared to the recommended ratio of 2:1, impacting the crop yields negatively.
Media reports reveal that the government plans to raise the federal excise duty to 10pc on key ingredients of fertilisers in the upcoming budget — at a time when fertiliser prices in Pakistan are already significantly higher than those in India and Bangladesh. Any further increase is likely to reduce fertiliser application even more, undermining both crop productivity and national food security.
In recent years, farmers’ distress driven by falling crop prices and rising production costs has been further compounded by two major challenges: climate change and the widespread sale of substandard seeds and pesticides.
Last year, farmers loudly protested the poor-quality paddy (rice) seed supplied by seed companies, yet no meaningful action was taken by the government. Instead, the blame was conveniently shifted to climate change.
This year, the seed mafia once again inflicted heavy losses — this time on spring maize growers — by selling substandard hybrid seeds that resulted in poor pollination and weak grain-setting. These recurring incidents raise a serious concern about the effectiveness of the government’s seed regulatory framework and the performance of relevant oversight agencies.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s agriculture sector is now characterised by high production costs, low yields, growing vulnerability to climate change, and heavy taxation — particularly after the recent hike in agricultural income tax rates to as high as 45pc. The sector is rapidly losing its competitiveness and inching towards a full-blown crisis, which is likely to have devastating consequences not only for agriculture but also for Pakistan’s largely agri-dependent economy.

The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following last week’s ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.
On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
“Today, Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar
arrived in Beijing on a three-day official visit from 19-21 May 2025. He was received at the airport by senior Chinese officials and the Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Khalil Hashmi,” the Foreign Office announced in a post on X.
 






During the visit, Dar is set to hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.
The visit forms part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China. It also underscores the two countries’ shared commitment to further strengthen the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, the report added.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.
Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reports.
 






The foreign minister said that during the last three weeks, he had two telephonic interactions with FM Wang Yi, who invited him to visit China.
Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.
Referring to his telephonic interactions with his counterparts worldwide, Dar said that they have exposed the Indian blame game against Pakistan, including the attack on any nuclear installation.
The Foreign Office earlier said Dar will undertake an official visit to Beijing to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the FO said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”
It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China.
China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.
Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
Visit reflects Islamabad’s importance attached to developing relations: spokesperson
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said Dar’s visit reflected the importance Pakistan attached to developing bilateral relations.
“China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. The two countries maintain close, high-level exchange and cooperation,” she said during her regular briefing while commenting on Dar’s visit.
The spokesperson said that China stood ready to work with Pakistan to further deliver on the importance of understandings between leaders, enhance strategic communication and deepen exchange and cooperation to advance bilateral relations and accelerate the building of a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.
On the India-Pakistan situation, she said that China had stated its position multiple times and added, “We will continue to maintain communication with both sides and play a constructive role for a comprehensive, lasting ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability.”
In response to a question, Mao Ning said, “I want to tell you that India and Pakistan are both China’s important neighbours. China attaches, all along, great importance to China-India and China-Pakistan relations.”
The Chinese side was committed to the philosophy and principle of good neighbourliness with neighbouring countries, she said.
“We welcome and support the realised ceasefire between the two countries and are ready to play a constructive role in realising a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability,” she added.</p><small>2025-05-19 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/190816184658c03.jpg?r=081645' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911952/ex-us-president-joe-biden-diagnosed-with-aggressive-prostate-cancer' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-US president Joe Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer</strong></a><br><p>Former US president Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday.
Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement.
“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said.
Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8pc of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease.
Biden’s physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency. He abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against Republican Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats.
President Trump, who has repeatedly berated Biden since taking office in January, expressed sympathy on Sunday for Biden and his wife, Jill, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” he wrote, referring to first lady Melania Trump. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”
Former US president Barack Obama took to his X to offer sympathies and prayed for a “fast and full recovery” for Biden. Obama hoped Biden “will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace”.
 






India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “deeply concerned” and extended his best wishes for a quick and full recovery.
 






Biden’s office said the cancer scored a nine out of 10 on the Gleason score grading system, which is used to help determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU Langone, said a score of nine is “very high risk”, but added that many men can live “five to 10 years and beyond” even with metastatic prostate cancer.
“Over the last decade, there have been many advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer,” he said.
Dr Chris George, the medical director of the cancer programme for the Northwestern Health Network, said prostate cancer is no longer curable once it spreads to the bones, but that there are treatments that can control it.
Biden, Trump oldest to win presidency
Biden was the oldest person to win the US presidency at the time of his election in 2020. Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated vice president Kamala Harris last year.
Some prominent Democrats have recently acknowledged that it was an error to advance Biden as the 2024 nominee, given widespread concerns among voters about his age. Long before the debate last summer, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed a majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Biden was too old to serve a second term.
“It was a mistake for Democrats not to listen to the voters earlier,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, before Biden’s diagnosis was announced.
Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office, making only a handful of public appearances, including an April speech in which he defended the Social Security Administration against Trump’s planned cuts.
He has also defended his legacy in interviews and rejected reporting in two new books that he suffered from cognitive decline during his last year in office.
“They are wrong,” he said earlier this month on ABC‘s “The View,” referring to the books’ authors.
Biden’s diagnosis triggered an outpouring of supportive statements on Sunday from Democrats and Republicans alike.
“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris said in a statement on X.
 






Biden lost a son, Beau Biden, in 2015 due to brain cancer.
In 2022, Biden revived an Obama-era programme known as Cancer Moonshot, seeking to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50pc over the next 25 years.</p><small>2025-05-19 11:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1905272202fd50c.jpg?r=052744' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911903/noor-mukadam-case-zahirs-lawyer-tells-sc-no-medical-board-formed-to-assess-clients-mental-state' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam case: Zahir’s lawyer tells SC no medical board formed to assess client’s mental state</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned till tomorrow the hearing of an appeal against the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer, the man convicted for the gruesome murder of Noor Mukadam, as the accused’s lawyer argued that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court was upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty.
Justice Hashim Kakar was leading a three-member bench, which included Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared as Zahir’s counsel while Advocate Shah Khawar was present on behalf of Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.
 
 

During the previous hearing, Safdar had sought more time from the court to submit Zahir’s medical reports, claiming he was “mentally ill” and the lower courts that sentenced his client had “ignored” this aspect.
Justice Kakar had observed that a hearing was adjourned “only on the death of a lawyer or a judge” and regretted “unnecessary delays” in court cases. Safdar’s request for more time was then approved with the consensus of both sides.
The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case were to be taken up as well. An appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas being heard.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
The hearing
At the outset of his arguments, Safdar informed the bench that he has submitted Zahir’s medical history from 2013 until now to the court.

He detailed the punishments handed over to his client — death sentence on murder, jail term turned into death penalty on rape and concurrent 10 years in prison for kidnapping.
Safdar contended that only the charge of murder was mentioned in the first information report (FIR) initially, while other offences were included 22 days later.
He claimed there was “no evidence” provided that the site of the crime was the suspect’s residence. Police had previously said that samples collected from a knife, used as a murder weapon, and blood stains matched with the victim.
The lawyer detailed that the incident took place at 10pm and the case was registered at 11:30pm that night, before 12:10am, which he said was the stated time of death in Noor’s post-mortem report conducted the next morning.
Safdar further said that Amjad, a Therapy Works employee injured during the incident, was “made a suspect instead of a witness”.
He added that the police were “depending” on Zahir’s photogrammetry tests and CCTV footage, referring to a video that revealed that Noor had jumped from the first floor of the house and ran towards the main gate to save her life, but found it locked.
At one point, Safdar mentioned a video leak controversy involving former accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik, to which Justice Kakar replied that the lawyer was depending on a verdict by then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa.
The judge remarked that it would be “very difficult to prove literally anything” if one went strictly by parameters.
Barrister Safdar argued that the murder weapon was a “small knife on which the fingerprints of the accused were not even present”. He added that all witnesses, besides Noor’s father, were officials.
 
 

Here, Justice Kakar observed, “There were no eyewitnesses in the case. All evidence is circumstantial.”
Justice Kakar then indicated that the appeal would be decided soon, remarking that a “relief would be given if due”. He remarked, “Judges should bear some pain. It should not be the case that an appeal is taken up for hearing and then the case is not heard again.
“Individuals remain locked up in a death cell for as many as 10 years. This will not happen now.”
The court then gave a break in the proceedings, saying they will resume later in the afternoon after a hearing of the reserved seats case.
When the hearing resumed at around 1:30pm, Safdar contended, “My client’s mental state was not okay when the incident happened. The trial court did not have his mental state properly examined.”
Justice Kakar responded, “You should have filed an application at that time about whatever objections you had.”
Upon Safdar claiming that Zahir was not “medically fit at any stage of his trial”, the bench asked him whether any medical board had been formed to assess the suspect’s mental state.
To this, the lawyer replied, “This is the concern. No medical board was formed at any stage.”
 
 

The sessions court had dismissed the application to form a medical board in January 2022, noting that the concern was not raised in earlier hearings but only when the trial was “going to end very soon”. It had pointed out that the plea was moved without providing Zahir’s medical history and “just to get rid of criminal liability”.
During the hearing, Safdar noted that the evidence referred to the CCTV footage and a digital video recorder, and recalled that Zahir had pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.
Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow (Tuesday), with Safdar expected to conclude his arguments and Khawar to present his.
Case history
Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
 
 

In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s appeal, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
Brutal murder
After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.
In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.
 
 

The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.
Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.
Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.
Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.

Earlier, The Indian Express, citing sources, reported that the BCCI had informed the ACC about its decision to pull out from the Women’s Emerging Teams Asia Cup in Sri Lanka next month and from the biennial Men’s Asia Cup in September in a bid to “isolate Pakistan cricket.”
“The Indian team can’t play in a tournament that is organised by the ACC whose chief is a Pakistan minister”, the source said, referring to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who was appointed as the new president of the ACC last month. The outlet further quoted the source as saying that the BCCI  was aware that an Asia Cup without India was not a feasible option as many of the sponsors of international cricket events were from India.
The International Cricket Council (ICC), the global governing body for cricket, did not comment on the matter.
Later in the day, however, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia refuted the news, telling Indian outlet ANI, “Such news [is] devoid of any truth as till now. BCCI  has not even discussed or taken any such steps regarding the ensuing ACC events, let alone writing anything to the ACC.
“At this stage, our prime focus is on the ongoing IPL and subsequent England series, both men’s and women’s.”
He continued: “The Asia Cup matter or any other ACC event issue has not come up for discussion at any level, hence any news or report on that is purely speculative and imaginary. It may be said that BCCI, as and when any discussion on any ACC events takes place and any important decision is reached, same will be announced through media.”
India has not played bilateral cricket against Pakistan since 2007 due to tense relations between the countries. Both countries only play each other in international tournaments on neutral grounds.
The political relations between Pakistan and India have led to similar issues in the past. In 2023, a hybrid-model solution was proposed by official Asia Cup host Pakistan after the BCCI refused to tour the neighbouring country to play the tournament.
During the ICC Champions Trophy, India played their matches in Dubai after the country’s government had refused to send its team to Pakistan, the original hosts of the tournament.
Earlier this month, India head coach Gautam Gambhir called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum, including the Asia Cup and ICC events.</p><small>2025-05-19 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19114234109e3eb.jpg?r=115756' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911967/six-killed-in-exchange-of-fire-over-family-feud-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>Six killed in exchange of fire over family feud in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>Six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud on Monday in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Seven people were reported to have been shot in the exchange of fire between two families, six of whom died on the spot.
The deceased have been identified as Fazl Amin, Hazrat Amin, Ahmed, along with three women. Another woman was reported to be critically injured and has been shifted to Lady Reading Hospital.
“The incident took place when a dispute over family issues escalated and members of both families opened indiscriminate fire at each other,” said Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Faizi.
According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Peshawar Noor Jamal who oversees investigations, a first information report (FIR) has been registered, and three have been named as accused. Raids are currently underway to arrest them.
“The sister of one of the accused had died three days ago,” as per the SSP. The accused suspected the aggrieved party of having had a hand in the sister’s death. The two parties were related to each other.
Police and rescue teams arrived at the scene immediately after the incident and cordoned off the area. Security remains on high alert.
Residents expressing regret over the incident, demanded the authorities to arrest the perpetrators and punish them severely.
Earlier this year, six people were killed due to a family feud in the Pehlawanano Pul area of Peshawar. The victims were ambushed while returning from a wedding. In December last year, another blood feud claimed five lives in Peshawar.

Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah told Dawn.com, “The family had consumed Mithai [sweets] with tea at night, after which their condition deteriorated.”
“Three siblings have died after consuming poisonous food. Their mother was in critical condition,” he added.
He said that the family were shifted to the Qazi Hussain Ahmad Medical Complex, where the siblings — 8-year-old Maryam, 6-year-old Hareem and 4-year-old Muhammad Yaman — were pronounced dead.
“The mother is undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Shah continued.
The police lodged an inquiry report on the complaint of Bakht Sher, the children’s father, the spokesperson said, adding that an investigation was underway to ascertain the cause of the deaths.
In April, three children lost their lives while five others were in critical condition after having “poisonous” sweets in Punjab’s Hafizabad district.

An average GDP growth rate of 6.7 per cent from 2014 to 2024 has propelled India’s nominal GDP to a projected $4.2 trillion by 2025, outpacing many global economies, including China’s 6pc growth over the same period.
Strategic partnerships like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a burgeoning tech sector, and a youthful population of 1.36 billion have fuelled ambitions of great-power status.
Yet, this self-assurance has led to diplomatic bristling, notably India’s irritation with US mediation in its recent ceasefire with Pakistan, which The Economist reported as a perceived slight to New Delhi’s sovereignty. More sobering was a recent aerial skirmish, detailed by the Financial Times, where China’s J-10 ‘Dragon’ fighters outmatched India’s Western-supplied aircraft, exposing technological disparities.
A realistic comparison of India and China reveals a stark truth: despite rapid progress, India remains a smaller, less advanced, and regionally focused power, far from matching China’s economic scale, military might, and global influence. Overconfidence risks strategic miscalculations unless tempered by pragmatism.
Economically, the chasm between the two Asian giants is undeniable. China’s nominal GDP, estimated at $19.2tr in 2025, is 4.6 times India’s, while its $32.9tr GDP in purchasing power parity terms is 2.3 times larger than India’s $14.6tr. This gap reflects not just size but industrial dominance. China accounts for 28.4pc of global manufacturing value added, cementing its role as the world’s factory, while India’s 3.3pc share underscores its industrial infancy.

Despite rapid progress, India remains a smaller, less advanced, and regionally focused power, far from matching China’s economic scale, military might, and global influence

In 2023, China’s exports reached $3.5tr, nearly five times India’s $0.78tr, embedding Beijing in global supply chains. India’s higher growth rate offers long-term potential, but its per capita income of $2,730 in 2023 — less than a fifth of China’s $12,670 — signals limited resources for transformative investment. China’s economic head start, built on decades of state-led industrialisation, keeps India trailing, despite New Delhi’s aspirations.
Development metrics further highlight the divide. China’s Human Development Index score of 0.788 ranks it 75th globally, in the ‘high’ category, reflecting superior education, healthcare, and living standards. India’s 0.644, ranking 134th in the ‘medium’ category, is hampered by a poverty rate of approximately 40pc (below $6.85 per day) compared to China’s 17pc.
Infrastructure disparities are stark: China’s 42,000 km high-speed rail network (the world’s largest), contrasts with India’s zero operational kilometres, with projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad line still in development.
India’s youthful demographic, nearly matching China’s 1.43bn, promises future dividends, but without significant investment in skills and industry, this potential remains untapped. China’s advanced infrastructure and higher living standards provide a stronger foundation for economic and military power.
Militarily, India’s ambitions collide with harsh realities. China’s 2023 defence budget of $0.29tr is 3.6 times India’s $81.4bn, funding a 730-ship navy, three aircraft carriers, and around 200 J-36 stealth fighters.
Moreover, the J-10 ‘Dragon’s recent combat debut, as reported by the Financial Times, showcased China’s technological edge over India’s imported Sukhoi Su-30s and Rafales. India’s military, ranked 4th globally by the Global Firepower Index with 1.46 million active personnel and nearly 160 nuclear warheads, is formidable but heavily reliant on foreign suppliers — Russia, France, and the US — for critical systems.
Indigenous efforts like the Tejas fighter face production delays; meanwhile, only 26–30pc of India’s budget goes to modernisation, constrained by 50–60pc allocated to salaries and pensions (23.6pc for pensions in 2025–26, covering 3.4m retirees). China, with approximately 30–40pc on personnel and around 40pc on equipment, prioritises advanced platforms, widening the technological gap.
This technological lag is a critical vulnerability. China’s advancements in artificial intelligence, 5G, and hypersonic weapons, driven by firms like Huawei and state-backed research and development (R&D), position it as a global leader. And while India’s tech sector excels in information technology services, it lags in cutting-edge innovation, with defence R&D consuming less than 5pc of its budget. The J-10 skirmish underscored this disparity, as China’s homegrown systems outperformed India’s imported arsenal.
India’s nuclear arsenal (160 warheads) is less than half of China’s (350), and its missile systems, like Agni and BrahMos, while capable, trail China’s hypersonic and satellite capabilities. Closing this gap requires India to boost domestic R&D and reduce reliance on foreign arms, a goal of initiatives like “Make in India”, but one hampered by budgetary constraints.
Globally, India’s frustration with US intervention in the Pakistan ceasefire, as The Economist noted, reflects a desire for strategic autonomy. Yet, its influence remains regional, focused on countering Pakistan and China in the Indian Ocean. China, a United Nations (UN) Security Council permanent member, shapes global norms through the Belt and Road Initiative and institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. India’s contributions to UN peacekeeping and its Quad role enhance its stature, but it lacks the economic and military clout to rival China’s agenda-setting power.
The ceasefire episode reveals India’s sensitivity to external influence and its limited global leverage, which necessitates partnerships with powers like the US, even if they chafe national pride.
India’s leadership, buoyed by a decade of progress, risks overestimating its capabilities. The 6.7pc growth rate and strategic partnerships have fuelled aspirations, but hubris clouds judgement when confronting China’s superior scale and technology.
The Pakistan ceasefire irritation signals a desire for sovereignty, yet India’s military and technological limitations — evident in the J-10 skirmish — demand pragmatism. India’s $81.4bn defence budget, strained by pensions, cannot match China’s $292bn, nor can its 3.3pc global manufacturing share rival China’s 28.4pc. Globally, India’s regional focus contrasts with China’s expansive influence.
As it stands, India’s economy, military, and global influence are dwarfed by China’s, and incidents like the J-10 skirmish and US mediation underscore its vulnerabilities. Rapid growth is a foundation, not a guarantee, of power. In China’s shadow, India must play a long game, leveraging its potential while acknowledging its limits.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 19th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-19 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19132613392963f.jpg?r=132623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911939/the-latent-price-for-patriotism' target='_blank'><strong>The latent price for  patriotism</strong></a><br><p>The current tense regional environment likely underpins the government’s proposal, endorsed by its largest coalition partner, the Pakistan Peoples’ Party, to raise the defence budget by 18 per cent for the next fiscal year. The critical question for a resource-constrained country, however, remains: who will pay for it?
Driven by patriotism and deep respect for a military establishment that successfully repelled the strategic ambitions of a hostile neighbour five times its size, most Pakistanis would readily pledge to defend the nation’s sovereignty and support the security apparatus in any way they can. However, is it fair, or economically prudent, to place a greater burden on those already living below poverty line, or to further tax businesses that are essential to job creation and unlocking the country’s vast human potential?
Younus Dagha, former Sindh minister and federal secretary, and current Chairman of the Policy Research and Advisory Council at Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, advocated for prioritising ‘smart defence’ in future investments. He urged the government to mobilise funds for strengthening national security by tapping under-taxed sectors such as agriculture, retail and wholesale.
“Pakistan’s recent victory over India has underscored two critical lessons. First, we cannot afford to neglect our defence needs. Second, outcomes in modern warfare are determined by investment in and training on high-tech platforms. A comprehensive reorganisation of our defence structure must be a priority for decision-makers. Continued investment in smart defence systems is essential, while resources should be reallocated from traditional formations that have become obsolete, as clearly demonstrated by the 40-month Russia-Ukraine stalemate,” he remarked.

An 18pc increase in the defense budget implies a larger share of the national revenues being redirected at the expense of other critical areas

“Imposing additional taxes on existing taxpayers will be counterproductive for the economy,” he cautioned. “Only an economically strong country can defend itself effectively.”
Citing heightened security threats, media reports indicate that the government is actively considering a significant 18pc increase in the defence budget, raising it to over Rs2.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2025-26. The proposed hike is being justified as essential to bolstering national security.
However, the report did not clarify how the government plans to finance the enhanced defence spending. In Pakistan, such increases are typically covered through a mix of government revenue, borrowing and other financial arrangements.
The increased allocation to the ministry of defence from the national budget implies a larger share of government revenues being directed toward military spending, potentially at the expense of other critical areas.
The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has two options: either mobilise funds specifically for defence as a one-time emergency measure outside the regular budget, or it can increase the defence allocation at the expense of other key budgetary heads. These include resource transfers to provinces, the administrative structure comprising federal salaries and civil/military pensions, support for state-owned enterprises and development spending on physical and social infrastructure. All of this would be in addition to interest payments, which remains non-negotiable.
Some senior members of the government’s economic team, when contacted, were either unaware of the latest developments or declined to share details that could clarify how the government intends to balance its finances under the current circumstances.
Given the sensitivity of the subject, most business leaders approached chose to refrain from making public statements. Speaking privately, they unanimously agreed on the need to defend the country effectively and acknowledged that adequate resources must be allocated for this purpose. However, they emphasised the importance of more efficient utilisation of existing funds and urged the government to cut non-essential and unproductive public expenditures. Echoing the views of Younus Dagha, they stressed that if additional resource mobilisation is necessary, whether through tax or non-tax measures, it should target under-taxed sectors, rather than further burdening those already contributing more than their fair share.
Drawing on the practices of successive governments, including the current coalition, some analysts believe that once again, ordinary citizens will be asked to bear the burden in the name of national security. “Elite platforms representing industrial barons, brokers and bankers, are well-organised and highly effective,” observed one analyst.
“They have privileged access to the corridors of power and wield influence through both financial clout and political connections. If they succeed in shielding their own interests, it will be a voiceless majority that ends up paying a disproportionate price for national security,” he added.
A critic of the government’s handling of public welfare pointed to its recent decision not to fully pass on the benefits of declining international oil prices to people, even though they were made to bear the full impact when global prices surged.

On the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan will high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been entrusted to lead the delegation comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani. The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace.
Speaking to Geo News today, Sherry said apart from the military front, diplomacy during conflict is an important front, as India built a false narrative using “fake news”. She said Bilawal has emerged as leader to expose India’s narrative.
She said India is sending seven delegations to different capitals after Pakistan made the announcement. She mentioned there is a rift there as Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had been replaced by his own party for the delegation to Europe.
“Apart from the military victory, Pakistan diplomacy is winning as it remained with the facts and did not allow a strategic drift,” she said.
She said unlike Pakistan, questions are now being raised within India. “A BJP-backed journalist R. Jagannathan has written an article that India is fight on 2.5 fronts — against Pakistan and China, and half front against its own people.”
The PPP senator said the standard diplomacy will continue on the water issues but they should also discuss with climate experts and climatology. She recalled there is no precedent that such treaties are suspended unilaterally and have survived wars.
“You cannot close a river like a tap. In my view, India will start construction on Chenab. Based on their attitude, they [India] will move forward without considering its global impact,” she added.
She said Bilawal will be busy for the next two weeks visiting different world capitals, and then they will focus on water diplomacy. She said the ambassadors in Pakistani missions abroad will have to follow up on Pakistan’s narrative.
She continued that Pakistan should maintain diplomatic relationship with Iran to maintain peace in the province. She said India is a member of BRICS and other global forums, but did not receive any support from them as the ‘security guarantor’ against China.
Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted by the prime minister who requested that the former foreign minister “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in “these challenging times”. The PPP said the committee would also “inform the international community about Indian aggression and its false propaganda”.
In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar left for China a three-day official visit today at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi amid regional tensions, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
During the visit, the foreign minister will hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.</p><small>2025-05-19 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605150-too-soon-to-speak-of-any-deal-for-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Too soon to speak of any deal for Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>

The new scam surfaced when the Punjab health department detected several ‘faulty entries’ of the dispensation of medicines to the patients in order to show to the chief minister that the hospital was following her order to provide free medicines/care to the poor patients.
An official privy to the development said that the medicines were officially dispensed to the outpatient department (OPD) patients from the hospital’s pharmacy reportedly in violation of the standard healthcare protocols.
He said the consultants at the hospital OPD used to update the prescribed slips on the official portal that was linked to the relevant departments, including the official pharmacy of the teaching institute, from where the free medicine was given to the poor/needy patients.

Protocols violated to ‘show CM that patients were being provided with free medicines’; health dept seeks probe

 
 

According to some official documents, the health authorities brought the matter to the knowledge of the LGH senior management while dispatching several individual cases, showing the grave negligence in dispensation of the medicines to the patients, contrary to those prescribed by the consultants.
It mentioned a case of one Muhammad Shakeel who visited the OPD on April 9. As per the documents, he was prescribed antihypertensives, antidiabetics and antihyperlipidimics by the consultant keeping in view the diagnoses of the disease and uploaded the same on the official portal. However, he was later dispensed three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin), 30 tablet each.
It was declared as a blatant violation of the standard healthcare standards as the medicines prescribed and those dispensed didn’t match each other, forcing the patient to take ‘irrelevant/unnecessary drugs’ which had nothing to do with the disease or the medicines advised by the consultant.
Similarly, a patient, Allah Dita, was advised medication for dysphagia and abdominal pain at the OPD of the LGH.
Committing the same blunder, the hospital dispensed three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, coamoxiclav and clarithromycin), 20 tablets each against the given prescription.
The health authorities pointed out another case of a patient, Muhammad Shahbaz, who was provided by the hospital pharmacy 30 tablets each of four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, Cefixime and Moxifloxacin). Interestingly, his consultant had advised him the drugs, including tamsulosin (used to improve urination in men with an enlarged prostate), tramadol/paracetamol etc.
A patient, Naseem, was prescribed, on April 17, velosef and Danzen DS while the hospital dispensed additionally cefixime (antibiotic), amlodipine, allopurinol and co-amoxiclave (antibiotic), showing how the patients were forced to take unnecessary medicines in ignorance.
“I am directed to inform you that several instances of irregular dispensation of medicines at your hospital have been reported to this department, wherein medications are being dispensed in a manner that does not align with the prescriptions issued by the authorised medical attendant,” reads the official letter of a health department officer sent to the LGH.
He declared that these irregularities had posed a grave and a direct risk to patient safety and effectiveness of treatment. He asked the hospital to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit detailed report and comments along with the fixation of responsibility upon the delinquents, to the health department. The hospital was given three days deadline in this respect.
The health department further issued instructions to the LGH to ensure that all medicine dispensation strictly adhered to prescriptions through the Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), without any alterations.
“Any staff found involved in such practices must be held accountable, and corrective measures must be implemented to prevent recurrence/any untoward event,” reads the official letter.
The official source said that the hospital would have to expand the scope of investigations to find out the exact number of the affected patients and the period as it was feared that the violation was being committed since the last many months.
LGH Medical Superintendent Prof Dr Faryad Hussain confirmed to Dawn about the serious complaints of irregular dispensation of drugs to the patients visiting its OPD, saying that matter had been put on priority in the larger interests of the poor patients.
“We have constituted a high level committee to launch impartial probes to dig out facts with a prime objective of fixing those who committed blatant violations of the standard healthcare protocols,” he said.
Prof Hussain added that OPD Director Dr Adnan Masood would head the committee with strict directions to submit a report during the stipulated time period.

The accused included former Union Council chairman Husnain Ali and district office-bearers of the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat organization: Naseeb Ali, Naseer Ali, Muhammad Manasif, Shujaat Ali, and Amjad Asger. Another accused Muhammad Hasan Ramay died of natural causes during court proceedings.
According to the report, on Dec 8, 2019, Basharat Ahmed, a village lumberdar, and his brother Mubarik Ahmed were shot dead in broad daylight by nine unidentified assailants on motorcycles in village 99A/6-R, Sahiwal. The incident was suspected to be a sectarian killing. The attackers, whose faces were covered, managed to flee the scene.
Farid Town Police registered an FIR against Husnain Ali, Abdul Ghaffar, Naseeb Ali, Naseer Ali, Manasib Ali, Mukhtar Ali, Amjad Ali, Shujat Ali, and two unknown suspects based on a complaint filed by Mubarik’s son, Kamran Tahir. All accused were residents of the same village.
The case remained in court until another incident occurred on September 25, 2021, when the complainant Kamran Tahir, son of Mubarak, was shot dead while returning home on a motorcycle. Once again, Farid Town Police registered a murder case against four unidentified assailants, acting on complaints filed by the victim’s mother, Mubarika Afzal, and Mubarik’s widow, under PPC sections 302 and 34.
The trial for both cases spanned five years. Due to a lack of evidence, the judge acquitted all seven accused.

“Strategically, the battlefield tossup was a clear setback for India. An aspiring diplomatic and economic power, it now finds itself equated with Pakistan, a smaller, weaker country,” the newspaper noted in a report on Sunday.
“The four-day clash reminded the world of India’s powerlessness to resolve 78 years of conflict with the troubled nation next door. Any act of confrontation plays into the hands of Pakistan, where friction with India has long been a lifeblood. Outright military victory is nearly impossible, given the threat from both countries’ nuclear arsenals,” it added.

Says Delhi now finds itself equated with Islamabad, claiming any act of confrontation plays into the hands of Pakistan

Drawing on interviews with more than a dozen diplomats, analysts, and officials, the report painted a stark picture of India’s enduring dilemma. “After multiple wars and several failed attempts at solving their disputes, the problem has only grown in complexity,” it added.
 
 

The analysis reinforces Pakis­tan’s position that the Kashmir dispute remains a nuclear flashpoint — one that must be resolved to ensure the safety and prosperity of more than 1.6 billion people in South Asia.
Noting that such clashes only fuel religious extremism in both countries, the newspaper added, “In India, the shift to strongman, Hindu-nationalist rule has left it boxed in whenever tensions rise, as the right-wing base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi often calls for blood.”
Joshua White, a former White House National Security Council official and now a professor at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan was “encouraged by Trump’s references to Kashmir”, viewing them as an opportunity to bring international attention back to the dispute. “India’s strategy,” however, “will be to wait until Trump moves on to other priorities.”
He said the structure of a neutral forum, possibly in the Gulf, “does structurally and historically favour Pakistan, and could make it harder for India to justify this deal to its public.” When asked whether India would accept third-party mediation on Kashmir, White was unequivocal: “No, I do not.”
 
 

Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of several books on Pakistan’s military, expressed cautious optimism. He told Dawn that after “a much-needed pause,” talks could begin “at a neutral site,” allowing both sides to test the waters without appearing to compromise.
Some subtle signals may already be in motion. White pointed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to convene Pakistan’s National Command Authority, describing it as a “soft nuclear” message that might have helped defuse tensions. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s reference to an agreement “to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site” suggests that diplomatic mechanisms are at least under discussion.
Hassan Abbas, of the National Defense University in Washington, emphasised the importance of US intervention. “President Trump’s recent assertion that US intervention prevented a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan underscores his role as a peacemaker in a volatile region,” he told Dawn.
“By facilitating a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, Trump demonstrated effective crisis management and a commitment to global stability.”
 
 

Abbas said Trump’s “balanced approach, avoiding favouritism, marks a departure from previous US policies that were perceived as leaning towards India. This neutrality not only helped de-escalate immediate tensions but also sets a precedent for constructive engagement in the region.”
Comparing Trump’s intervention to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s televised address, Abbas noted: “Modi’s speech felt like a relic from the past, offering a weak defence of India’s policy towards Pakistan. Notably, he overlooked acknowledging the US role — a point that won’t go unnoticed in Washington.”

This event has sparked strategic concerns about Indonesia’s procurement of advanced weaponry and its unresolved airspace sovereignty issues, particularly in critical border regions such as the Strait of Malacca.
This essay argues that the development of a national air defense system cannot be separated from full operational control of national airspace. Without sovereign authority over its own skies, investment in advanced air defence weaponry becomes strategically irrelevant. This is a strategic framework for building Indonesia’s air defence system in a comprehensive, gradual and geography-informed manner, based on real threats.
The air battle over Kashmir between India and Pakistan delivered a jolt to the global understanding of modern air warfare. Pakistan’s Air Force (PAF), operating Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets, claimed to have shot down several Rafale combat aircraft, long considered a symbol of Nato-standard technological superiority, belonging to the Indian Air Force (IAF).
This event not only showcased Pakistan’s combat capabilities and China’s growing technological prowess but also provoked a broader discourse on the effectiveness and relevance of arms acquisitions by developing countries, Indonesia included, within the wider defense system context.

Islamabad did not simply purchase J-10C fighter jets from China, but also built supporting doctrine, training systems and operational structures to integrate them into a formidable air defence apparatus

Indonesia’s ongoing purchase of Rafale aircraft has drawn attention, especially when contrasted with the current status of its national airspace, parts of which remain under foreign management.
The 2022 agreement between the Indonesian and Singaporean governments, which delegated the management of airspace over the critical border area of the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, presents a stark paradox: Indonesia is investing in high-cost military assets while lacking the full authority to operate them strategically in its most vulnerable airspace. This area, in fact, should be the primary focus in the blueprint of any air defence system.
A primary obstacle in building a robust national air defence system is Indonesia’s limited authority over its own airspace. The airspace above the Riau Islands and the Strait of Malacca, from sea level to 37,000 feet, has remained under Singapore’s operational control for air traffic services for 25 years and is subject to extension, as stipulated in the 2022 bilateral agreement.
This dependency directly undermines the operational capacity of the Air Force to conduct patrols, training exercises and air law enforcement in this strategically vital zone. Without sovereign operational authority, air defence development becomes ineffective, akin to owning advanced weapons but lacking the right to carry or train with them on the actual battlefield.
Air defence is not merely about fighter aircraft or anti-aircraft missiles; it is an integrated system that forms a subsystem of the broader national defence system. Its effectiveness relies on long-term planning, geographical awareness and integration with various elements: radar networks, command and control systems, main and forward airbases, and air surveillance intelligence.
As many military experts have highlighted, air defence is only effective when based on geographic mastery and field-tested operational experience. The system requires years to develop and demands inter-regime consistency. Thus, air defence is not an instant project to be accomplished within a five-year political term, but a strategic process grounded in a strong national doctrine and full sovereignty as fundamental prerequisites.
There is a common misconception, among the public and even among policymakers, that air power is defined by the number of fighter jets a country possesses. In reality, fighter aircraft are merely one component of a comprehensive air defence system. As main weapon systems (alutsista), fighter jets cannot generate strategic effects without being supported by a complete network: reconnaissance radars, early warning sensors, tracking systems and an integrated command-and-control structure.
In Indonesia’s case, owning aircraft like the Rafale does not automatically confer air superiority, especially if those jets cannot be flown freely in the critical airspace they are meant to defend. Thus, air defence development must start from building the system, not merely buying the platform.
The most strategic step in enhancing Indonesia’s air defence is to regain full control over its national airspace, particularly in critical border zones such as the Strait of Malacca. Without this step, Indonesia will remain strategically impotent.
This reclamation effort requires a multifaceted approach, diplomatic, technical and military. The government must pursue assertive yet lawful renegotiations based on international aviation law, referencing the 1944 Chicago Convention and Law No. 1/2009 on aviation, which affirms that a state holds full and exclusive sovereignty over its airspace. Persuasive efforts are also needed to end the colonial legacy of foreign control over sovereign territory. Inter­national relations must be guided by mutual respect and understanding, with full recognition of each nation’s strategic interests.
The success of a nation in building its air defence system is the product of dedication, political will, and a deep understanding of operational sovereignty. Pakistan, for example, did not simply purchase J-10C fighter jets from China, but also built supporting doctrine, training systems and operational structures to integrate them into a formidable air defence apparatus.
Indonesia should learn from this approach and end the pattern of acquiring military assets without first establishing the systems to utilise them. Instead of chasing “symbolic prestige”, Indonesia’s defence strategy must be grounded in geographic reality, threat perception and the capacity to control its own airspace. Indonesia cannot fully develop its air defence without achieving operational sovereignty over its national airspace.
The procurement of advanced fighters like the Rafale will only carry strategic value if the country is able to deploy them freely and effectively in its critical air zones, zones that constitute the front lines and center of gravity of national defense.
Therefore, the current defence policy priority must be to reestablish sovereign control over national airspace and develop an air defence system that is gradual, integrated and rooted in a strong national doctrine.

• Advises UK to take balanced stance, raise rights issues, and consult Kashmiri diaspora
LONDON: The United Kingdom (UK) Parliament has called for renewed diplomatic engagement between India and Pakis­tan over the Kashmir dispute, highlighting human rights concerns and urging the UK government to adopt a more active, balanced role in addressing the region’s long-standing tensions.
In a report published by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Commi­ttee, as part of a wider inquiry into the UK’s strategy for South Asia, lawmakers expressed alarm over the deteriorating situation in India-held Kashmir since August 2019, when the Indian government revoked the region’s special constitutional status under the Article 370.
The report cited increased military presence, restrictions on civil liberties, limitations on press freedom and arbitrary detentions, concluding that “there had been a marked erosion of democratic rights in the region.”
 
 

The committee also examined governance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. While acknowledging the situation in these areas differs from Indian-occupied Kashmir, the report noted ongoing concerns about democratic limitations and the lack of full constitutional representation. It recommended the UK government continue to monitor human rights and political conditions on both sides of the Line of Control.
The cross-party committee called on the British government to make greater use of its diplomatic channels and historic ties with both New Delhi and Islamabad to encourage dialogue. While reaffirming the UK’s position that the Kashmir issue “must be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan,” the report stressed this “should not prevent Britain from raising concerns, especially over human rights violations.”
Parliamentarians urged the Foreign, Common­wealth and Development Office (FCDO) to press both countries to allow greater access for international observers, including British parliamentarians and diplomats, to visit both sides of the disputed territory.
They also recommended the UK take a more balanced approach, engaging with both governments equally and avoiding any perception of partisanship, while ensuring its diplomacy is rooted in British values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.
The report further advised that the UK should listen closely to the views of the large Kashmiri diaspora in Britain, encouraging the government to be mindful of community concerns and to use its influence to foster peace and reconciliation.
 
 

The report, titled “India and Pakistan: a UK foreign policy strategy for the 2020s,” forms part of a broader examination of British foreign policy priorities. It reflects growing parliamentary concern over rising authoritarianism in parts of South Asia and the potential consequences of inaction on long-standing regional conflicts.
While acknowledging sensitivities, the committee argued that the UK “cannot remain passive in the face of growing instability in Kashmir.” It concluded that discreet but principled diplomacy, consistent rights monitoring, and a willingness to engage with both sides could play a constructive role.
The UK government is expected to respond formally to the committee’s recommendations in the coming months.
Kashmir dispute could spark nuclear war
Also, the British Par­liament criticised India’s aggressive behaviour, warning that the longstanding Kashmir dispute with Pakistan poses a serious threat to regional stability and could potentially escalate into a nuclear conflict, APP adds.
A 42-page report recently made public highlights the clashing approaches of the two South Asian nations, with India favouring bilateral dialogue and Pakistan advocating for international mediation in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
 
 

The report says that India used a “suspicious incident in occupied Kashmir” as a justification to take military action against Pakistan — a move the report says threatens regional peace.
It also criticises India for “creating obstacles in the way of a solution to the Kashmir issue” by disregarding UN mandates.
The report further accuses the international community, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, of inaction on the matter.
According to the report, Pakistan adopted a defensive strategy “within the framework of responsibility, patience and international law” during the recent conflict.

According to media reports, the foreign ministers of the three nations will meet to discuss issues of mutual interest, including regional stability and cooperation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to leave today (Monday) for an official visit to Beijing from May 19 to 22 to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability, the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is expected to arrive in Beijing tomorrow.
The talks follow the recently brokered ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and amid reports that Afghanistan was supporting India in the conflict with Pakistan. Pakis­tan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said in a statement on Sunday that no country was supporting India except Israel and Afghanistan.
 
 

Mr Dar’s visit is being seen as significant as tensions remained high in the region following a tense military standoff between Pakistan and India over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. India blamed the attack on Pakistan without evidence.
On the night of May 6-7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down six Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Paki­stan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid the escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.
According to the Foreign Office, Mr Dar will travel to China today at the invitation of the Chinese foreign minister and will hold in-depth discussions there.
“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the Foreign Office said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”
It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between the two countries.
Pakistan and China share longstanding strategic ties, with economic cooperation at the core of their relationship. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, continues to be described by Pakistani officials as a “lifeline” for the national economy.
In March, China further extended its financial support by rolling over a $2 billion loan for one year, easing pressure on Pakistan’s foreign exch­ange reserves and offering critical relief amid economic challenges.

The demands gain heft from the permission granted to truckers, carrying perishables from Afghanistan, to cross into India from Pakistan via Wagah. After the Pahalgam attack, India shut down the Wagah-Attari border crossing, a move reciprocated by Pakistan.
The officiating Jathedar of Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargajj, also joined the calls, urging the governments of India and Pakistan to reopen the Kartarpur corridor, especially now that the “atmosphere between the two countries is becoming more peaceful”.
Sikhs pray daily for open access to the gurdwaras from which they were separated, and therefore, keeping the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor closed is not justified, he said, adding that the corridor would further contribute to peace and harmony between the two nations and strengthen mutual ties.

Since its inauguration in 2019, a large number of Sikh devotees have been visiting the holy site in Narowal, where they bow in reverence and receive the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Hence, reopening the corridor without delay would reflect and honour the sentiments of the Sikh community.
According to Jathedar Gargajj, both nations — and the region as a whole — are in greater need of peace, progress, mutual love, and cooperation, rather than tension and conflict. He praised those national and international leaders who played a wise and compassionate role in defusing the war-like situation and promoting calm.
A separate report in Indian newspaper The Hindustan Times said the ceasefire between India and Pakistan brought renewed hope to Indian devotees, eager to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak.
Although Pakistan continued to keep its side of the corridor open, India suspended the pilgrimage on May 7. Approximately 150 Sikh pilgrims, who had arrived at the Dera Baba Nanak Integrated Check Post in India’s Gurdaspur district, were turned back after waiting over 90 minutes, as the corridor was abruptly shut after tensions rose due to the Pahalgam attack.
Nevertheless, the Sikh community remains optimistic.
 
 

Dera Baba Nanak resident Baba Sukhdeep Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak, echoed this sentiment: “The recent hostilities cast a shadow over the future of the corridor. This ceasefire is welcome news for us. We struggled for many years to see this corridor become a reality.”
The Kartarpur corridor was jointly inaugurated by the Pakistan and Indian prime ministers on November 9, 2019. It grants Indian pilgrims visa-free, dawn-to-dusk access to the revered shrine. Stretching 4.7 km, it connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib in India’s Punjab with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan.
Wagah-Attari border
While the Kartarpur corridor remains shut, the Indian government has allowed the entry of freight trucks from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan into India through the Wagah-Attari border.
Official sources said the Afghan authorities had requested the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate 162 freight trucks stuck in Pakistan due to the border closure.
“In this regard, it is intimated that the Government of India has given necessary permission to allow the aforementioned 162 trucks into India through the Wagah-Attari Border. It is further intimated that Indian Customs have made necessary arrangements to facilitate the movement of cargo in aforesaid 162 trucks,” an official document revealed.
 
 

Mukesh Sidhwani, a dry fruit trader from Amritsar, welcomed the development. “The trucks have started crossing over. So far, five trucks have crossed. This is a huge relief. The goods are semi-perishable, and every day’s delay translates into massive losses,” the report quoted him as saying.
Nearly 90 per cent of India’s trade with Afghanistan is routed through the Attari-Wagah border, which is also the only land link allowed for trade between India and Pakistan. The development came a few days after Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held his first-ever conversation with Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and underlined India’s friendship with the Afghan people and its support for their development needs.

ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the procurement of 179 vehicles, including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division’s austerity measures.
Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister’s FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators — boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc — the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement.
“An amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,” the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation “in light of austerity measures of Finance Division”.
The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established.
 
 

“The proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,” the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027.
The estimated cost savings from the project’s investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project’s investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms.
This investment in FBR’s data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation’s ICT systems. “If the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,” the FBR advocated.
The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project’s benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc.
The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc — well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc.
The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country’s tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses.
“The cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,” the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh.
The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the digitisation of the tax system to integrate it with broader economic activity.
 
 

The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac­k­up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems.
The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the transformation plan include value chains’ digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support.
In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling.
Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan.
The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid.
The FBR expects its reform efforts to generate an additional $81bn by the end of fiscal year 2028-29. The project also covers replacement of end-of-life ICT equipment, cloud infrastructure, updated software licences, data warehousing, business intelligence tools, and complete LAN and VoIP connectivity for field offices.
As part of the Rs2.237bn allocation, the FBR will also procure 350 bulletproof jackets and helmets for operational personnel.
The tax authority defended its expanded resource needs by pointing to a fourfold increase in the number of tax filers, from 1.5m in 2017 to over 6m by the end of June 2024. It also cited the growing volume of third-party data being gathered to broaden the tax base and identify defaulters.

• ISPR DG believes ceasefire can ‘hold easily’
• Confirms CBMs from both sides
• Says Indian policy on Kashmir not working
ISLAMABAD: A ceasefire reached between Pakistan and India following days of military confrontation does not have an expiry date, officials from both countries confirmed, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.
Rumours of a Sunday deadline gained traction after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistan’s Senate last Thursday that the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed during a May 14 conversation to extend the ceasefire until May 18.
Media outlets then widely reported that the ceasefire was set to expire. However, officials from both sides clarified on Sunday that no DGMO talks were scheduled for the day and that the ceasefire, originally brokered through intensive US diplomacy, remained in force without a set end date.
“There is no expiry date to the break in hostilities, as reaffirmed in the DGMOs interaction of May 12,” an Indian official said, countering speculations of an imminent breakdown.
There was no official statement from the Pakistan Army, but a diplomat on the condition of anonymity said the ceasefire remained in effect and carried no set time frame for expiration. He said the discussions of the DGMOs were aimed at “making the ceasefire sustainable”.
 
 

The May 10 ceasefire came after the most serious escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours in over two decades, with cross-LoC shelling, drone incursions, and air force strikes pushing both sides to the brink. The United States, led by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, played a key role in mediating the truce, with support from Saudi Arabia.
Initial violations were reported on the day following the ceasefire. But since then, military commanders have engaged in constructive dialogue. The May 12 call between Pakistan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai focused on reinforcing mutual commitments to avoid any aggressive or hostile actions, officials said.
In that conversation, the two sides had agreed to begin a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, restoring the usual peacetime arrangement where the border is manned primarily by Pakistan’s Rangers and India’s Border Security Force.
Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said both DGMOs “have maintained periodic contact since May 10” and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation.
 
 

While Islamabad views the ceasefire as a potential stepping stone toward broader peace talks on long-standing issues like the Kashmir dispute and water rights, India has taken a more rigid stance.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the ceasefire as a “temporary pause,” and Defence Minister Rajnath  Singh declared that “Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation”.
‘Ceasefire will hold easily’
In comments underscoring Pakistan’s stance, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Arab News that the ceasefire was holding.
The DG ISPR also reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding position on Kashmir, warning that the dispute remains a flashpoint unless resolved through dialogue.
 


“As far as Pakistan army is concerned, this ceasefire will hold easily and there have been confidence-building measures in communication between both the sides,” he said.
“If any violation occurs, our response is always there … but it is only directed at those posts and those positions from where the violations of the ceasefire happen. We never target civilians. We never target any civil infrastructure.”
Conflict potential persists
On a separate, the Pakistani military spokesman also warned of far-reaching consequences if India attempts to follow through on threats to cut Islamabad’s share of the Indus River water system.
Last month, New Delhi unilaterally suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, blaming Pakistan for a deadly militant attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, an allegation Pakistan denies.
“Their policy on Kashmir — of oppression and trying to internalise it — is not working,” he said.
 
 

“Till the time Indians don’t sit and talk about Kashmir, then (as) two countries sit, and we find a solution to it, the conflict potential is there.” “I hope that time doesn’t come, but it will be such actions that the world will see and the consequences of that we will fight for years and decades to come,” the army spokesperson said. “Nobody dares stop water from Pakistan.”
The waters treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has survived multiple wars between the two neighbours and is considered one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally. Its potential unravelling adds a dangerous new tier to an already volatile regional equation.

Deputy Commissioner Qila Abdullah Riyaz Khan told Dawn.com, “Two people were killed while 11 were injured in the explosion.”
According to the initial investigation, the explosives were planted in a vehicle, DC Khan said, adding that the bomb disposal squad and law enforcement officials were summoned and an investigation was launched.
“An emergency was declared at the District Health Headquarters in Qila Abdullah, where medical assistance was being provided to the injured,” he said.
In a separate statement given to Dawn.com, Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan said, “The blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.
“After the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.”
According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.
Condemning the blast, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said he shared the grief of the families of the deceased.
“The war against terrorism is undoubtedly a war of national security,” CM Bugti said in a statement, adding war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated.
“The elements involved in the Gulistan blast will be brought to an end soon,” he added.
In a separate statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said security forces were present at the spot, the area was being cordoned off, and evidence was being collected.
“The state is taking steps to protect the people by utilising all resources,” Rind said.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p><small>2025-05-18 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605096-pakistan-wants-peace-but-will-never-bow-to-indian-hegemony-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan wants peace but will never bow to Indian hegemony: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>
