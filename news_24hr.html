• Govt accused of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities
DHAKA: Bangladesh’s former police chief pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity committed during a crackdown on protests last year, while ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina was formally indicted, prosecutors said after the trial resumed Thursday.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government attem­pted to crush a student-led uprising.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to Ha­­sina’s ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League.
Former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Mamun “pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity”, Muhammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor at the ICT, told reporters.
Islam said Mamun has agreed to assist the court by acting as a witness, giving “all the knowledge he has regarding the crimes committed during the July-August uprising”.
The court has approved separate accommodation to ensure Mamun’s safety. The tribunal on Thursday also rejected defence lawyers’ requ­est to have the charges against Hasi­­na and her interior minister Asaduz­zaman Khan Kamal dismissed.
Both Hasina and Kamal were formally indicted in the same case.
Amir Hossain, the state-appointed counsel for Hasina and Kamal, however, remained hopeful.
“The trial is at an initial stage, and there are several other phases,” he said.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to India as the protests ended her 15-year rule. She has defied an ext­radition order to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia opened on June 1. Hasina faces at least five charges at the ICT, including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”.
Prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.
She was already convicted of contempt of court in a separate case on July 2, receiving a six-month sentence. Fugitive former minister Kamal is also believed to be in India.
Attacks on religious minorities
A rights group in Bangladesh accused the government on Thursday of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities in the country and excluding them from reforms.
The Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council has been voicing concern over targeted attacks on religious minorities since the fall of ousted former premier Sheikh Hasina last year.
“We have recorded 2,442 incid­ents from August 4 last year to June 30 this year, involving murders, rapes and gang rapes, vandalism of temples, homes, and businesses,” Monindra Kumar Nath, general secretary of the council, told a news conference.
The council alleged such attacks have continued even after the int­e­rim government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus took charge of the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
His administration has often dismissed the accusations, saying the crimes against minorities are politically motivated, the victims believed to have supported Hasina’s Awami League party in the past.
“Instead of giving due attention to our concerns, the government chose to label them as false, fabricated, and exaggerated,” Nath said, alleging the accused were “enjoying impunity”.
The unity council criticised the government for excluding religious minorities from any of the reform commissions tasked with proposing measures to end all forms of discrimination in the society.

• Rubio voices optimism over potential ceasefire
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency on Thursday said at least 52 people, including eight children, were killed by Israeli forces in the Palestinian territory battered by more than 21 months of war.
The latest deadly strikes and gunfire came just hours after Hamas, which runs Gaza, announced it was willing to release 10 prisoners as part of indirect ceasefire talks with Israel.
Civil defence official Mohammad al-Mughair told AFP that 17 people were killed in a strike in front of a medical point in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.
 
 

Mughair said eight children and two women were killed in the strike.
Yousef Al-Aydi, 30, said he was among dozens of people, mostly women and children, waiting for nutritional supplements in front of the medical point.
“Suddenly, we heard the sound of a drone approaching, and then the explosion happened,” he told AFP by phone.
“The ground shook beneath our feet, and everything around us tur­ned into blood and deafening screams.”
“What was our fault? What was the fault of the children?” asked Mohammed Abu Ouda, 35, who had also been waiting for supplies.
“I saw a mother hugging her child on the ground, both motionless — they were killed instantly.”
Four people were killed and several injured in a pre-dawn air strike on a family home in Al-Bureij camp in central Gaza, Mughair added.
AFP footage from Al-Bureij showed a family including three young children sitting among rubble outside their tattered tent after an air strike hit a house next door.
Mughair reported 27 more people killed in bombardments across the territory, including 15 people in five separate strikes in the area of Gaza City.
One person was killed southwest of the southern city of Khan Yunis by “Israeli military fire”, Mughair said.
Three more, including a woman, were killed by Israeli gunfire on civilians near an aid centre in the northwest of nearby Rafah, he added.
More than 600 people have been killed around aid distributions and convoys in Gaza since late May, when Israel began allowing in a trickle of supplies, the United Nations said in early July.
Sticking point
Hamas on Thursday said it opposes any ceasefire deal that includes a large Israeli military presence in Gaza, after offering to release some prisoners.
Indirect negotiations aimed at securing a truce in Gaza between Hamas and Israel entered their fifth day in Qatar on Thursday, an official with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
The current negotiations — taking place after 21 months of fighting and multiple previous rounds of talks that failed to yield a breakthrough — began in the capital Doha on Sunday in hopes of clinching a deal based on a US-backed framework that envisages an initial 60-day truce.
“Hamas and Israel remain in Qatar,” the official said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of talks.
Hamas said disagreements over the free flow of aid into Gaza and Israel’s military withdrawal were sticking points, as were its demands for “real guarantees” for a lasting peace.
Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP on Thursday: “We cannot accept the perpetuation of the occupation of our land and the surrender of our people to isolated enclaves under the control of the occupation army (Israel).
“This is what the negotiating delegation is presenting to the occupation so far in the current round of negotiations in Doha.”
Hamas was particularly opposed to Israeli control over Rafah, on the border with Egypt, and the so-called Morag Corridor between the southern city and Khan Yunis, he added.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was “hopeful” about the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza, telling reporters on Thursday that negotiations were “closer” than they had been in some time.
“We’re hopeful… It appears that generally the terms have been agreed to, but obviously now you need to have talks about how you implement those terms,” Rubio said on the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian countries in Malaysia.
“I think perhaps we’re closer than we’ve been in quite a while, and we’re hopeful, but we also recognise there are still some challenges in the way.”
He acknowledged that previous rounds of talks had fallen apart at similar stages. “One of the fundamental challenges is Hamas’ unwillingness to disarm, which would end this conflict immediately,” Rubio said.
The top US diplomat added that “the Israelis have shown some flexibility”.

The prime minister, while chairing a review meeting on the NTC’s performance, instructed a third-party review of its recent performance and remodelling the organisation on modern lines to meet the requirements of the new tariff regime effectively.
The premier said the government was committed to addressing the NTC’s training and resource deficiencies and aligning its operations with modern requirements. He directed the immediate activation of the NTC’s Appellate Tribunal and sought a briefing on the implementation of the given directives by the next month.
E-commerce push with Alibaba
In a separate meeting with a six-member delegation of Alibaba Group, led by Alibaba International Markets President James Dong, Prime Minister Shehbaz underscored the strategic importance of e-commerce for Pakistan’s export-driven economic vision and directed the formation of a dedicated committee to devise a roadmap for the sector’s growth.

Directs overhaul of PNSC, formation of committee to boost e-commerce

The prime minister highlighted that over 300,000 locally manufactured Pakistani products are currently being sold on Alibaba’s platforms and emphasised the need to increase this number substantially. He called for proactive engagement with the private sector to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access international markets through digital platforms.
 
 

Mr Dong praised the contributions of Pakistani entrepreneurs in global trade and reiterated Alibaba’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s e-commerce ecosystem. “Currently, more than 300,000 Pakistani products are listed on Alibaba’s website, with textiles being the most in-demand category,” he noted.
PNSC restructuring
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz directed the relevant authorities to formulate a comprehensive plan to transform the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) into a shipping company of international standard.
Presiding over a meeting to review the restructuring, reforms and performance of the PNSC, he said that the country’s shipping sector held vast potential for investment. He directed that a comprehensive plan be prepared to encourage private investment in the shipping sector. He also called for steps to increase the number of ships and promote the competitive use of PNSC vessels for cargo movement to and from Pakistan.
Meeting with Qatari princess
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz met Sheikha Asma Al Thani, the pioneering Qatari mountaineer, and congratulated her on becoming the first woman in the Gulf and Qatar to successfully summit Nanga Parbat, the world’s ninth-highest mountain.
The prime minister lauded Sheikha Asma’s remarkable courage, resilience and determination in achieving this significant milestone, the PM Office said in a statement.
In recognition of her achievement and commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s natural beauty, the PM formally appointed Sheikha Asma as the Brand Ambassador for Pakistan’s Mountains and Tourism.
The PM highlighted Pakistan’s immense pride in being home to five of the world’s 14 highest peaks, making it a premier destination for mountaineers and adventure seekers.
He thanked Sheikha Asma for promoting Pakistan’s mountain ranges on the international stage and invited her to return for future expeditions. She has al­­ready summited nine of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks and aims to climb all 14.
Sheikha Asma expressed her gratitude to the people of Pakistan for their hospitality and praised the support of local porters and guides during her recent ascent. Reflecting on her experience, she described K2 as the best peak and said that it is a “complete mountain” with its beauty unparalleled.

• Claims Rs191bn saved in FY25 as power losses dip due to governance reforms
• Govt eyes 6,000MW surplus supply for crypto, data centres
ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is making another attempt to convince the federal cabinet to curtail returns on solar net metering and remove electricity duty on consumer bills being resisted by the provinces.
Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Power Minister Awais Leghari said he would be presenting a revised plan to the federal cabinet in a week or two based on consultations with some stakeholders to stagger the recovery of investment on net metering to two to three years from the current one and a half years.
Mr Leghari also announced that the Power Division on Thursday moved a summary for cabinet approval to finalise rules for wheeling charges, a key step towards operationalising the competitive electricity trading market.
He added that the government was exploring plans to offer 5,000-6,000MW of surplus electricity at marginal costs to industries such as data centres and crypto mining, and discussions were underway with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The minister said that a change in the net metering arrangement would not reduce the electricity tariff, but there would be no further increase in rates. Unless measures are introduced, the expansion of solar systems could add to the surplus on the grid. The combination of the sale of surplus power and the containment of solar expansion would help grid stability, he said.
Mr Leghari said the consumers had adopted solar net metering under a government policy and would not be penalised, but its return had become unjustified. If not corrected, even the net metering consumers would be bearing billions of rupees worth of electricity bills in future.
He said the government had saved over Rs3 trillion from negotiations with the independent power producers, cancelled over 10,000MW of new power plants out of 17,000MW committed capacity and saved over Rs4tr in future payments, whereas correction of net metering was also on the agenda.
Mr Leghari said he had written letters to the chief ministers to convey that power distribution companies (Discos) would no longer act as collection agents of electricity duty for provinces.
He said that only one chief minister had so far responded, and once the remaining three give their feedback, a case would be presented before the federal cabinet for a final decision.
Mr Leghari said the Power Division had been able to reduce recovery, transmission and distribution losses through good governance.
He said the government suffered a Rs591 billion loss in fiscal year 2024 due to less billing and higher technical losses of Discos.
This money could have utilised in the development or any other meaningful sector, he added.
The minister said in fiscal 2025, this loss was brought by Rs191bn to Rs399bn through good governance.
 






The government has appointed board of directors to Discos “on merit and without any political consideration”.
He said Discos had been given the target of Rs100bn annual reduction over the next five years, but their losses had been cut by Rs191bn even before the start of that five-year period.
This was achieved through improvement in recoveries, he said, explaining that the Discos had suffered Rs315bn loss in FY24 when recovery against billing stood at 92.4 per cent.
The bill recovery was improved to 96.6pc in FY25, bringing down these losses to just Rs132bn, as the recovery rate of five Punjab and Islamabad companies was beyond 101pc.
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, mostly attributed to electricity theft, fell slightly from Rs276bn in FY24 to Rs266bn in FY25, with losses decreasing from 18.3pc to 17.6pc.
The minister added that savings could have been higher — around Rs225 billion — had the government been able to appoint new boards for Hyderabad and Sukkur Electric, which remain delayed due to litigation.
He revealed the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had uncovered massive electricity theft at four steel and furnace factories using tampered meters.
He claimed the factory owners wielded significant influence and attempted to remove security officials and Disco staff involved in the investigation. However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and government institutions backed the anti-theft campaign.
The minister said the Power Division and Discos would focus on recoveries, dismantle networks of theft and improve governance and overall efficiencies.
Responding to a question, Mr Leghari said the Power Division believed that since K-Electric’s overwhelming reliance would now be on the national grid, the uniformity of tariff should extend to fuel costs as well as quarterly adjustments.
He said K-Electric’s import from the grid had increased to 1,600MW from 1,000MW, which would further go up by another 400MW with additional interconnection within a month.
He said the Power Division would engage with the power regulator and present a detailed point of view before the federal cabinet for an amicable and sustainable solution.
The power minister conceded that LNG import contracts were made almost a decade ago on the assumption that LNG-based power plants would operate on LNG and consume 100pc of imports.
However, he stressed that no power plant should be operated without a fuel-based merit order. Therefore, the previous assumptions did not materialise.
“We believe that violation of economic merit order is a mortal sin,” he said, adding that the only solution was to review LNG contracts as had been done in the case of independent power producers.

The CJP made these remarks in a meeting with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) chairman, Rabiya Javeri Agha, on Thursday.
The meeting discussed initiatives for the protection and promotion of human rights, according to an official statement.
CJP Afridi appreciated the NCHR for its efforts to address rights-based challenges.

IFJ asks apex court to review Peca, directs govt to amend it

Ms Agha briefed the CJP on NCHR’s ongoing initiatives, policy interventions and monitoring mec­hanisms related to the implementation of constitutional and legal safeguards for fundamental rights.
 
 

They reaffirmed the need for co­ordination among state institutions to address systemic gaps in the human rights protection framework.
The CJP emphasised the judiciary’s commitment to upholding constitutional values, due process, and the protection of citizens’ fundamental freedoms.
The meeting ended with a “shared resolve to work collectively for a more just, inclusive and rights-respecting society,” the official statement added.
Peca review
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) secretary general, Anthony Bellanger, has requested the Supreme Court to review the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) as a matter of priority and provide necessary directions to the government to amend the law.
In his letter addressing the CJP, Mr Bellanger said “swift action” was needed to “address this critical situation for Pakistan’s media and pro-tect press freedom as guaranteed in Article 19 of Pakistan’s constitution”.
 
 

The letter was delivered to the apex court on Thursday by Shakeel Ahmad, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) secretary general.
The letter stated the increased political polarisation, widespread protests and social disruption meant media professionals across Pakistan were “facing increased challenges while performing their duties”.
They are also facing a “heightened level of legal persecution including litigation, intimidation and cases filed under Peca”.
“We understand that Pakistan is a signatory of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations Conventions that confer freedom of speech and expression and key democratic rights, but the curtailing of these fundamental rights under Peca is of great concern for the IFJ and international journalist community,” the letter explained.

• Nation braces for fresh spell of heavy rain from July 13
• Moist currents and westerly wave to intensify rains
• Glacial melt raises river flood risk in northern areas
LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Five people lost their lives and at least 40 were injured in Lahore on Thursday as torrential monsoon rains lashed the city, submerging roads and low-lying areas.
The deadly downpour came as a fresh spell of heavy rainfall is forecast to hit several parts of the country from July 13 to 17, with authorities warning of urban flooding, landslides and rising river levels.
The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) warned of potential flooding in rivers due to a sharp rise in temperatures in northern regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The warming trend is accelerating glacial and snowmelt, increasing river flows.
 
 

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), moist currents are currently entering the country and are likely to intensify from July 13. A new westerly wave is also expected to approach the country on the evening of July 13.
Under the prevailing weather conditions, rain-wind/thundershowers accompanied by scattered heavy to very heavy falls are expected in several parts of the country.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur, the rainfall is forecast from July 11 to 17.
Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit and others) is likely to receive showers on the night of July 11 and again from July 13 to 16 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakht­u­nkhwa, rain, windstorm and thundershower with scattered heavy falls (at times very heavy) is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Shangla, Battagram, Buner, Kohat, Karak, Bannu, Tank, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Waziristan, Orakzai, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Hangu and Kurram from July 11 to July 17 with occasional gaps.

Southern Punjab districts such as Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur may witness rain on July 11 and again from July 13 to 17.
In Balochistan, areas including Quetta, Zhob, Lasbela and Khuzdar are forecast to receive rain on July 11 and between July 13 and 16.
In Sindh, moderate rain-wind/thundershower is expected in Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad and Karachi from July 15 to July 17 with occasional gaps.
Hazards, warnings
The PMD warned that heavy to very heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding in local streams and nullahs in Murree, Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, hill torrents of D.G. Khan, northeast Punjab, Kashmir and parts of Balochistan from July 14 to July 17.
Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Peshawar and Nowshera from July 13 to 17.
Landslides and mudslides may disrupt roads in hilly regions of KP, Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from July 14 to July 17.
Windstorms and lightning may damage weak structures, including kutcha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
Farmers have been advised to plan agricultural activities accordingly, while travellers and tourists have been urged to avoid vulnerable areas and monitor weather updates.
The Met Office has requested all authorities concerned to remain on alert and take necessary measures to avoid loss of life and property.
The NEOC noted an increase in glacial melting in areas including the Ghujerab and Shimshal rivers (Hunza), Braldu River (Shigar), Husher and Saltaro rivers (Ghanche) and Uzhnu Gol (Chitral).
It advised the residents near rivers and streams to stay vigilant, especially during nighttime and heavy rainfall.
Lahore faces urban flooding
Lahore witnessed an unprecedented monsoon fury on Thursday, recording 182mm of rainfall in just a few hours, which submerged several major roads and low-lying areas.
According to Rescue officials, five people died and 40 were injured in rain-related incidents across Punjab in the last 24 hours.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported rainfall in Lahore for over seven hours. Rainfall recorded in other areas included Sialkot (77mm), Gujranwala (67mm), Chakwal (65mm), Jhelum (64mm), Hafizabad (60mm), Gujarat (52mm), Mandi Bahauddin (47mm), Attock (45mm), Faisalabad (51mm), Narowal (44mm), Okara (33mm), Toba Tek Singh and Sheikhupura (25mm), Rawalpindi and Kasur (23mm), Mangla (19mm), Sargodha (18mm), D.G. Khan (16mm), Jhang (11mm), Mianwali (10mm) and Sahiwal (8mm).
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said drainage was ensured “in the shortest possible time” in Lahore despite the heavy rainfall.
He said the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and district administrations remained on the ground to manage water removal from highways, underpasses and other vulnerable places.
He noted that this second monsoon spell will continue until July 13 and more rains are expected in divisions including Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur.
Mr Kathia said 36 people have lost their lives and 96 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents this season. A total of 42 houses were damaged and four livestock lost.
Most deaths were caused by roof collapses in dilapidated buildings. He urged citizens to avoid unsafe structures, live electric wires and flood-prone areas.

“Nine people abducted from both coaches have been killed, and their bodies have been recovered,” said Zhob Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam, adding that the bodies were being transported to Rak­hni for dispatch to their native towns in Punjab.
Shahid Rind, the Balo­chistan government’s spo­kes­­person, confirmed the incident and said that Fitna al Hindustan — a term used for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.
“There are reports about the kidnapping of some passengers from Sur-Dakai area,” he said, adding that security forces had launched a search operation to safely recover any remaining kidnapped passengers.
According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.
The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.
“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”
After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.
Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.
According to sources, the attackers checked the CNICs of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.
“There are reports about the killing of nine passengers who were kidnapped by the armed men,” a senior police official told Dawn.
The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said they had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.

The demo announced by the family members of imprisoned AAC leader Mumtaz  Nagari was attended by a large number of people from all walks of life,  including the members of the religious outfits. They organised a rally from Budulas Nagar and staged a protest at Harapu, the district headquarters of Nagar, blocking the highway for all kinds of traffic.
On May 15, the GB police arrested a dozen AAC leaders for alleged anti-state activities and hate speech during the recent Pakistan-India tensions and sent them on judicial remand. The protesters chanted slogans for the release of detained AAC leaders.
Speaking at the protest, the speakers said that AAC leaders had been illegally arrested for raising their voice for the people. They said it was an injustice to arrest activists who raised their voice to highlight issues faced by poor people.
They said the detained leaders were innocent, adding that the AAC leaders were not criminals or anti-state. Due to the protest, traffic remained suspended for at least four hours on the KKH.
Later, negotiations were held between the family members of detained AAC leader Mumtaz Nagari and GB Assembly member Ayub Waziri, Chief Min­is­ter’s Special Assistant Mu­­hammad Ali and Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan.
The government representatives assured the participants that the issue would be settled in one week, as the case was under trial. The protesters subsequently postponed the protest for five days, warning that they would take to the streets again if their demands remained unmet.

Speaking at the annual Pakistani Mango Festival, held this year at the University of the District of Columbia, Bischoping said: “Looking ahead, we are poised to continue growing our cooperation across a range of shared interests. On the economic front, we hope to expand mutually beneficial trade and commercial opportunities, especially in Pakistan’s growing critical minerals sector.”
Bischoping noted that US businesses were taking note of Islamabad’s reform agenda.
“We welcome Pakistan’s efforts to implement ref­orms that will enable private sector-led economic growth across numerous sectors. US firms seeking opportunities are drawn to a predictable and fair investment and regulatory environment. Suppo­rting these deals is good for bu­­siness — for both the Uni­ted States and Pakistan.”
The annual festival, which promotes Pakistan’s prized mango exports, has also become a cultural and diplomatic gathering point. This year’s event drew US officials, lawmakers, business leaders, think tank experts, journalists — and even some undeclared PTI supporters — all under one roof despite a tornado warning and torrential rain that caused the Potomac River to flood nearby streets.
 
 

Pakistan’s Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh opened the evening with humor: “Mango, a majestic fruit, seems to have magical qu­­alities as well. Mango and monsoon arrive together in Pakistan. Today, we brought the mangoes only — but the fruit brought the monsoon.”
Looking out at the stormy sky, he added: “We can see that mangoes have transported the monsoon to Washington as well.”
The event showcased signature Pakistani mango varieties — Chaunsa, Sindhri, Langra, and Anwar Ratol — alongside mango ice cream, mango kheer, and gift boxes, each including at least one prized mango.
Bischoping, while celebrating the occasion, also acknowledged enduring security ties: “As we pursue economic opportunities, we must also remain focused on our shared interest in counterterrorism. The United States and Pakistan share a common interest in combating terrorism, including threats from groups like ISIS, to keep both Americans and Pakistanis safe.”

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi took up Mr Chaudhry’s plea on Thursday.
The former PTI leader had filed an appeal against the LHC’s order issued on May 20, which rejected the plea.
Advocate Faisal Farid Chaudhry, who represented Mr Chaudhry, argued the high court dismissed the plea without perusing the case record and relying upon facts “sourced through AI and social media platforms”.
The petition had also questioned whether multiple FIRs over a single offence violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and whether a single trial should be conducted under the doctrine of similarity to ensure fairness and justice.
During the hearing, CJP Afridi observed the court will dictate the order in the presence of both parties to protect their rights.
He then called Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi and Mr Chaudhry to his chambers.
Earlier on April 8, the apex court had ordered the Anti Terrorism Courts (ATCs) to conclude within four months the trials of suspects allegedly involved in violence on May 9.
It also directed the ATCs to submit progress reports on trials to relevant high courts every two weeks.
On Thursday, CJP appreciated that the trial courts were working and the litigants were exempt from attendance in different districts. The CJP reminded Mr Chaudhry he also got an exemption from personal attendance from the LHC.
During the hearing, Mr Naqvi raised objections to the plea, stating the case at the high court was never heard on merits.
The LHC had ruled on the petition’s admissibility.
The Supreme Court also rejected a plea to halt cases relating to May 9 violence until the present case was decided.
The CJP stated the high court will consider and decide whether to stay the proceedings at the trial court or not.
In case the Supreme Court issues any decision, the case of the parties at the trial court may be affected, observed CJP.
The petitioner highlighted that he was primarily alleged to have committed abetment in connection with the events of May 9 and following his arrest, the authorities engaged in a systematic pattern of malafide conduct to substantiate base-less allegations.
The petitioner remained in police custody for nearly six months, during which no meaningful investigation was conducted, nor was his statement recorded as mandated by law, the petition alleged, adding he was booked in 11 “false, frivolous and politically motivated” cases in Lahore.
The petition stated the malafide intent became apparent when all FIRs implicating the petitioner were initiated through complaints lodged exclusively by police officers.
These complaints were registered on identical dates, with the reported times conspicuously overlapping.
The petitioner was not originally nominated in all FIRs. Instead, his alleged involvement was contrived through supplementary statements recorded at later dates, a practice evidently employed to manufacture charges retroactively.
The fragmented and duplicative proceedings across multiple FIRs violated the principles of justice but also subjected the petitioner to undue harassment and prejudice, the petition alleged, adding the failure to consolidate the cases under one trial has compelled the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court.
The fragmentation of cases across multiple stations not only created unnecessary procedural complexities but also subjected the petitioner to “undue harassment and prejudice”.
“Such an approach undermines the principles of fair trial and judicial economy, which demand that justice be administered efficiently and without duplication.”

• Azma says Imran’s sons will not be allowed to create unrest
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: In the lead-up to the ‘Free Imran Khan Movement’ expected to be launched on Aug 5, the PTI in the northern Punjab region has decided to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support – a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.
Since the incarceration of the party founder in 2023, the embattled political party has failed to mobilise workers, particularly in Punjab, due to a crackdown on its top- and middle-tier leadership by the provincial government as well as a disconnect between the party leaders and the cadre.
Seemingly, in order to bridge this gap, the North Punjab chapter of the party has established committees at the district and tehsil levels to run awareness campaigns for the release of Mr Khan.
A meeting chaired by chapter’s president Malik Taimoor Masood decided that the movement would be officially launched on August 5. It was further decided that Malik Yasir Patwali, Fayaz Tabassum and Yasir Jamal will lead the awareness campaign in Attock. In Rawalpindi Metropolitan, the task has been assigned to Malik Azeem, Tayyaba Raja and Muslim Shehzad. In Rawalpindi City, Zubair Khan, Wajahat Qayyum Abbasi, Parveen Rehmani and Hafiz Zahid will lead the campaign and Sardar Mansoor and Hasnain Sunbal will mobilise workers in Murree.
Similarly, three PTI workers, Farrukh Mehmood Sial, Rizwan Dani and Muhammad Afzal, have been nominated from Jhelum, while Aftab Ahmad Sahi, Malik Hammad and Ehtisham Kiani have been assigned duties in Chakwal. Ghulam Dastagir and Sajida Begum will work in Mianwali and Arslan Manch and Zohaib Umar will rally workers in Khushab. The party workers have been charged with mobilisation duties in Sargodha and Bhakkar as well.
The campaign will start at the district and tehsil levels, featuring corner meetings, door-to-door canvassing, and public engagement under the leadership of local MNAs, MPAs, ticket-holders, and organisational office-bearers. It was also decided that each district and tehsil would regularly submit performance reports to the designated representatives of the North Punjab chapter. These activities will be monitored and reports will be forwarded by the PTI North Punjab president to the senior leadership.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the party aimed to gain momentum ahead of the Aug 5 anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment and workers were being mobilised in this regard.
He said at present, they had not decided to take the protest to Islamabad, and for now it would be public meetings and rallies in respective cities and provinces. He said all the district committees would report to PTI Punjab President Aliya Hamza, who would then inform the central leadership about the progress on mobilisation.
‘Unrest in Pakistan’
Meanwhile, the Punjab government’s information minister, Azma Bukhari, said Imran’s son — Kasim and Suleman — would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. Earlier this week, Aleema Khan had said that the ex-PM’s son would be visiting Pakistan to join the campaign for the release of their father. She, however, did not share a timeline in this regard.
In a presser in Lahore, Ms Bukhari said that Imran Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in the country. “Why did Khan’s sons not visit Pakistan when he was injured. Now suddenly, they are missing Pakistan,” she questioned. The minister said Mr Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. “Jemima has reportedly barred her sons from visiting Pakistan… The instigators will not be allowed to use children to spread unrest,” she warned.
On the other hand, Imran’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accused the government of preventing her children from speaking to their father and threatening to arrest them if they came to Pakistan. “My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father Imran Khan. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly 2 years,” Ms Goldsmith said in a post on X on Thursday.
She said, “Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars. This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.” Her statement came after a warning from PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan’s sons would be arrested if they joined any violent PTI protest in Pakistan.
 






On the other hand, PML-N’s Senator Irfan Siddiqui hinted that the government might not arrest them on arrival, but the law would take its course if they joined the protest movement of the PTI.
“In my personal opinion as the government has so far not taken any official stance, Suleman and Kasim should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”

However, no such development has occurred.
It emerged on Tuesday that an Islamabad court last month ordered YouTube to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces.
Among the 27 sanctioned accounts — run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas — are those of the PTI, Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor, Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.
On Wednesday, former anchorperson Sabir Shakir said in a post on X: “Supreme Court declares ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional.”
The post was seen by more than 39,000 people.
The same claim was shared by several other X users as can be seen here, here, here and here.
The claim also circulated on Facebook, as can be seen here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to keen public interest in the matter related to the ban on 27 YouTube channels.
 
 

Observing the press statement in Shakir’s post showed that it was of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) of Pakistan, not the Supreme Court itself.
Further investigation through a keyword search led to a post on X dated July 9 by journalist Hasnaat Malik, a senior reporter covering Supreme Court affairs. He shared the press statement, with the caption: “Supreme Court Bar Association President Mian Rauf Atta has said that the judicial magistrate’s order regarding the closure of 27 YouTube channels is a violation of several constitutional provisions.”
 






The same SCBA statement was also shared by Toor on X.
 






The SCBA is an independent body established in 1989, comprising lawyers who practice before the Supreme Court. Formed under the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973, and operating under the Pakistan Bar Council, the SCBA works to uphold the rule of law and protect the interests of the legal profession and the public. It is important to note that SCBA is not part of the Supreme Court and functions independently.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged development yielded no news reports confirming that the Supreme Court declared the ban unconstitutional or took any action in the matter.
The same was confirmed by Dawn correspondent Umer Mehtab, who covers Supreme Court reporting, that the apex court was not involved in the matter.
He further said that any appeal against the Islamabad court’s order would first have to go and be processed in the high court. Any appeal against a lower court’s order cannot bypass the high court to go directly to the Supreme Court.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that the Supreme Court has declared the ban on 27 YouTube channels unconstitutional is false. No such development has occurred and so far only the SCBA, an independent body from the Supreme Court, has criticised the blocking order.

Lahore’s JFK Animal Rescue and Shelter said it received reports about an “extremely horrific situation after an Instagram influencer was seen posting torturing and killing animals, including bunnies and cats”.
The organisation said it immediately contacted the police, who reached the location to find dead bodies of animals and blood, with the suspect found “laughing” when approached.  The shelter said it would register a case against her and the animals were moved to shelters by the Police Animal Rescue Centre (PARC).
Visuals shared by the shelter showed cats, rabbits and birds of prey in captivity at the site.
Lahore Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi addressed the incident in a video, saying: “We just came back from a case where a girl … was torturing animals and she had rabbits, some exotic animals, cats and a lot of other stuff.”
She said the suspect had been posting graphic imagery of animal cruelty and violence on social media. The policewoman urged the public not to gift pets to someone suffering from mental issues.
“Please, start talking about animal cruelty because animal cruelty leads to us being cruel towards children [and] us being cruel towards vulnerable communities.”

She told Dawn.com the suspect was arrested and admitted to a mental healthcare facility. “She had run away several times from rehabilitation in the past as well,” the officer added.
ASP Naqvi said a case was registered on PARC’s complaint at Defence B Police Station under Pakistan Penal Code Section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal), Section 3 (penalty for cruelty to animals and for sale of animals killed with unnecessary cruelty) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, and Sections 10A (cruelty to animal prohibited), 12 (certificate of lawful possession) and 15 (restriction on dealings in animals, trophies or meat) of the Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation, and Management) Act, 1974.
The reason given by the ASP for the FIR was “cruelty towards animals after caging them and then killing animals and posting videos/pictures of the graphic content on Instagram and other social media platforms.”
PARC was established as a pioneering institution in Lahore in 2023, making significant strides over the past year in rescuing and protecting animals from abuse, neglect and abandonment.
Since its inception, PARC has safely relocated 1,130 animals to protection centres where they received proper care and treatment. These efforts have played a vital role in reducing animal suffering in urban settings. It generated a detailed report on animal abuse and the protection of animal rights in May, saying it had rescued 1,379 animals, 50 of them from extreme cruelty, in two years.
 
 

Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context.
The federal government did pass a law in 2018, increasing the fines for animal cruelty. It increased the maximum fine to Rs100,000 for animal cruelty, which had remained at the Rs50 level since the law was first passed in 1890, for first-time offenders. The minimum fine was raised to Rs10,000. There was a similar increase in fines for other offences against animals.
However, the law is only applicable in the federal capital, and does not extend to the rest of Pakistan. This is because animal welfare became a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment, and provinces are required to enact their own laws.
That is yet to happen, resulting in punishment for offences against animals in the rest of Pakistan staying the same as they were under the 1890 law.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102214329c58cf6.jpg?r=221802' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923338/iran-threats-in-uk-significantly-increased-intelligence-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran threats in UK ‘significantly increased’: intelligence watchdog</strong></a><br><p>A United Kingdom parliamentary committee on Thursday blamed Iran for at least 15 attempts to kill or kidnap British-based individuals since 2022, saying the threat from Iran had “significantly increased”.
London’s response has been too focused on “crisis management”, said parliament’s intelligence and security committee, with concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme dominating their attention too much.
Tehran swiftly issued a “categorical rejection of the unfounded, politically motivated and hostile allegations”.
The committee’s claims were “baseless, irresponsible, and reflective of a broader pattern of distortion intended to malign Iran’s legitimate regional and national interests”, said its London embassy.
The report comes after growing alarm in Britain at alleged Iranian targeting of dissidents, media organisations and journalists in the UK, including accusations of physical attacks.
Iran in March became the first country to be placed on an enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme, which aims to boost Britain’s national security against covert foreign influences.
It requires all persons working inside the country for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard to register on a new list or face jail.
“Iran poses a wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat to the UK, UK nationals, and UK interests,” Kevan Jones, chairman of the watchdog committee, said in the report’s conclusions.
“Iran has a high appetite for risk when conducting offensive activity and its intelligence services are ferociously well-resourced with significant areas of asymmetric strength.”
Jones said it bolstered this through proxy groups, “including criminal networks, militant and terrorist organisations, and private cyber actors” to allow for deniability.
‘Willing and able’
His committee’s report said that while Iran’s UK activity “appears to be less strategic and on a smaller scale than Russia and China”, it “should not be underestimated”.
The physical threat posed had “significantly increased” in pace and volume, and was “focused acutely on dissidents and other opponents of the regime” as well as Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK, it said.
“The Iranian Intelligence Services have shown that they are willing and able — often through third-party agents — to attempt assassination within the UK and kidnap from the UK,” the report said.
“There have been at least 15 attempts at murder or kidnap against British nationals or UK-based individuals since the beginning of 2022.”
Similarly, security minister Dan Jarvis said in March that Britain’s MI5 domestic intelligence service had tallied 20 Iran-backed plots “presenting potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents”.
The watchdog committee took evidence for two years from August 2021 for its report, a period which saw Tehran implicated in a plot to kill two London-based Iran International television anchors.
In March last year, one of the Persian-language outlet’s journalists was stabbed outside his London home. Two Romanian men have been charged in relation to the attack and face extradition to the UK to stand trial.
The counter-terrorism unit of London’s Metropolitan Police led the investigation. Iran’s charge d’affaires in the UK has said that the Tehran authorities “deny any link” to the incident.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10171556d1ea756.jpg?r=174542' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923308/anp-leader-maulana-khan-zeb-cop-gunned-down-in-kps-bajaur-police' target='_blank'><strong>ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb, cop gunned down in KP’s Bajaur: police</strong></a><br><p>Awami National Party (ANP) politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead on Thursday by unidentified suspects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”
DPO Rafiq added that evidence had been collected from the crime scene.
Khan Zeb was a member of the ANP’s central cabinet and held the office of secretary of ulema affairs, according to the party website.
ANP President Senator Aimal Wali Khan issued a statement condemning the killing, stating that the party would file a first information report against the state.
“State institutions are complicit in this incident because they have maintained criminal silence,” the ANP chief was quoted as saying. “After consulting with Khan Zeb’s elder brother, Sheikh Jahanzada, an FIR for the killing will be registered against the state.”
In a post on X, Wali Khan posted photos of himself and Khan Zeb with the caption “devastated”.
Meanwhile, ANP KP President Mian Ifitkhar Hussain strongly condemned the incident and declared three days of mourning in a statement shared on X.
“This attack is not only an attack on the Awami National Party but also on the Pashtun consciousness and peace,” Hussain was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, Hussain announced that the ANP’s KP chapter would observe three days of mourning, suspend all activities, and hoist black flags alongside party flags.
The statement added that Hussain was leaving for Bajaur and urged the party to maintain “morale, unity, and organisational discipline”.
Similarly, the office of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a statement condemning the incident and vowed to bring the suspects to justice.
According to the statement, the CM condemned the shooting and ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the incident and promptly arrest the shooters.
“Those involved in the incident will not be able to escape the grip of the law,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement condemning the killing, hailing Khan Zeb as “a leading peace campaigner and political leader of the ANP”.
“We demand a swift and impartial inquiry into this tragic incident,” the rights body wrote in a statement on X.
“The federal and provincial governments must ensure that normalcy returns to the terror-stricken districts of the province and that people who have suffered for decades can lead their lives peacefully and without fear.”
 






Politicians in KP have been targeted in attacks in the past.
This year, the home of Bajaur MNA Mubarak Zeb Khan was attacked twice, with an improvised explosive device exploding outside his house in May and suspects launching a rocket at the residence in June.
He was not home during the IED attack and was unharmed in the second incident.
Meanwhile, in March, the brother of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was shot dead in KP’s Swabi.
The former senator confirmed on social media that his elder brother, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, was shot dead in front of his house by unidentified gunmen in the village of Ahad Khan in Swabi.
“He was brutally killed in front of his home in an innocent village,” Mushtaq wrote. “My brother was very dear to me, he was my greatest help. It (his murder) is the greatest atrocity.”

The Royal Navy aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on June 14 in the state capital and has been grounded ever since, despite efforts to repair it. The Indian Air Force said last month it would help in the repair and return of the jet, which made an emergency landing when it was flying over the Arabian Sea off Kerala’s coast.
A British High Commission spokesperson had told Reuters the United Kingdom had accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility at the airport.
AP reported today that officials said engineers hoped to repair the plane in the next few days before it could fly back to the UK “sometime next week”.
The British High Commission confirmed to the outlet that a British engineering team was deployed to “assess and repair” the aircraft.
“There has been speculation in India that if the engineers fail to rectify the aircraft, it could be partially dismantled and transported in a cargo plane,” the report said, adding, however, that the UK’s Ministry of Defence “dismissed the speculation” in an emailed statement.
Earlier this month, the UK’s Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard said in parliament that a Royal Air Force crew were in Thiruvananthapuram and working with Indian counterparts.
Meanwhile, Kerala’s tourism board had taken advantage of the aircraft’s presence, posting an AI-generated image of the plane with coconut trees in the background on July 2. The post was captioned “Kerala, the destination you’ll never want to leave.”
 






“This was part of our tourism campaign. It has been one of the most innovative and eye-catching ones … It’s all in good humour and creativity,” Biju K, Kerala’s tourism secretary, had told Reuters.
In the viral social media post, originally created by entertainment website The Fauxy, the jet can be seen giving the state of Kerala five golden stars, calling it “an amazing place”.
“I don’t want to leave. Definitely recommend,” the image quotes the jet as saying.
“Though tourism is under the government, it has moved out of government space in promoting the destination,” said Roy Mathew, director of Stark Communications, the tourism department’s brand promotion agency.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10195044291465c.jpg?r=195049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923330/police-arrest-8-sbca-officials-owner-in-lyari-building-collapse-case' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 8 SBCA officials, owner in Lyari building collapse case</strong></a><br><p>At least eight officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were arrested on Thursday along with the owner of a building that recently collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari, claiming 27 lives.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the arrests were made today after a first information report (FIR) was registered a day ago.
“Nine officials and the present owner of the building were nominated in the FIR registered on a complaint of an official of the local government department. However, eight directors and deputy directors were arrested but one official was not arrested as he was sick,” he said. adding that the owner was arrested as well.
The provincial government had suspended SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro and announced strict action against all those responsible for the incident on Monday. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a fact-finding committee had been formed to present a report on the incident, adding that the Sindh chief minister ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR.
The FIR was registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on the complaint of Hamadullah, a section officer of the Sindh Local Government and Housing Town Planning Department, under Sections 34 (common intention), 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337-Ai (whoever, by doing any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person causes shajjah-i-khafifah) and 427 (mischief causing damage amounting to Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the building, spread over 527.3 square yards, was constructed in 1986. Its owner constructed the five-storey plus ground floor building in two portions, and for a considerable period, both portions (buildings) were in dilapidated condition and were unlivable. It added that one building with 20 apartments collapsed on July 4 due to the “criminal negligence” of the SBCA officials and the owner.
The FIR said the SBCA officials were aware of the dilapidated condition of the building over the years till the collapse.  It added that the officials “completely failed” to perform their official duty and “committed negligence and carelessness”.
The FIR further said that the officials “deliberately” did not mention in the official record that the building was dilapidated. It also added that the present owner of the building and other unknown owners also knew that it was not livable for humans. Despite this, the owners gave several flats on rent to members of the Hindu community and committed negligence.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the SBCA officials and owners of the building.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102042139a609e9.jpg?r=205240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923332/us-federal-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-despite-supreme-court-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>US federal judge blocks Trump’s birthright citizenship order despite Supreme Court ruling</strong></a><br><p>A federal judge on Thursday again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from enforcing his executive order limiting birthright citizenship nationwide after the United States Supreme Court restricted the ability of judges to block his policies using nationwide injunctions.
US District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, made the ruling after immigrant rights advocates implored him to grant class action status to a lawsuit they filed seeking to represent any babies whose citizenship status would be threatened by the implementation of Trump’s directive.
Laplante agreed the plaintiffs could proceed as a class, allowing him to issue a fresh judicial order blocking implementation of the Republican president’s policy nationally.
The question of whether to issue an injunction was “not a close call”, he said, noting children could be deprived of US citizenship if Trump’s order took effect.
“That’s irreparable harm, citizenship alone,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”
The judge said he would stay his ruling for a few days to allow the Trump administration to appeal and would issue a written decision by the end of the day.
The ACLU and others filed the suit just hours after the Supreme Court on June 27 issued a 6-3 ruling, powered by its conservative majority, that narrowed three nationwide injunctions issued by judges in separate challenges to Trump’s directive.
The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the country whose babies might be affected. Under the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s executive order would take effect on July 27.
Looking to seize upon an exception in the Supreme Court’s ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits.
The three judges who issued nationwide injunctions found that Trump’s directive likely violates the citizenship language in the US constitution’s 14th amendment.
The amendment states that all “persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside”.
The Justice Department has argued that Trump’s order conforms with the constitution and has asked Laplante to find that the plaintiffs cannot sue as a class.
The Supreme Court’s ruling did not address the legal merits of Trump’s order, which the Republican president issued as part of his hardline immigration agenda on his first day back in office in January.
Trump’s order directs federal agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of US-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident, also known as a “green card” holder.
More than 150,000 newborns would be denied citizenship annually if it takes effect nationally, according to Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates who have challenged it.</p><small>2025-07-10 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613386-anp-leader-leader-among-two-killed-in-bajaur-firing' target='_blank'><strong>ANP leader among two killed in Bajaur firing</strong></a><br><p>

In southern Afghanistan’s Kandahar city, where temperatures easily exceed 40 degrees Celsius, blue taxis can be spotted with an air conditioning (AC) unit strapped to the roof with an exhaust hose delivering the cool air through the passenger window.
“It started getting extremely hot three or four years ago. These cars’ AC systems didn’t work and repairs were too expensive. So I went to a technician, [and] had a custom cooler made,” said driver Gul Mohammad.
The 32-year-old spent 3,000 Afghanis ($43) for the system, which he connects to his taxi’s battery and regularly refills with water.
“This works better than [built-in] AC. ACs only cool the front — this cooler spreads air throughout,” said fellow driver Abdul Bari.
Other devices are connected to solar panels, also mounted on the taxi’s roof.

Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, is also one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is particularly affected by heat waves and is suffering from increased drought.
Murtaza, a 21-year-old technician, said that demand from taxi drivers has been growing over the past two or three years.
“Many cars weren’t equipped with air conditioning anyway, which is why we’re installing these,” he told AFP in his small shop in central Kandahar.
Afghan cities are often saturated with ageing vehicles, which are enjoying a last-ditch life after being transferred from neighbouring countries.
“When there’s no cooler, it becomes very difficult,” said Norullah, a 19-year-old passenger who did not provide a last name, his face inches from the blast of cold air. “These drivers are helping solve the problem, and that’s great.”</p><small>2025-07-10 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10184446ffc125f.jpg?r=185125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923322/turkish-ice-cream-seller-arrested-shop-sealed-for-sexually-harassing-tourist-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Turkish ice cream seller arrested, shop sealed for ‘sexually harassing’ tourist: local media</strong></a><br><p>An ice-cream seller in Turkiye was arrested and his shop was sealed earlier this week for allegedly sexually harassing a woman tourist, Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported.

“An ice cream vendor in Beyoglu started playing a cone trick on a female tourist and allegedly harassed the woman as she tried to take the cone,” Hurriyet reported.
“After the images surfaced on social media, the ice cream shop drew widespread criticism. Beyoglu Municipality teams subsequently sealed the business.”

In a statement released on Wednesday, police said that school staff informed the teachers and principal of bloodstains in the toilets. To find who was responsible, girls of classes 5-10 were called into the convention hall, where they were shown photos of bloodstains in the toilet and on the tiles.
The students were then asked to reveal who was on their periods. The teachers took down details, including thumb impressions, of the girls who raised their hands, and took the rest of the girls to washrooms where they were stripped and checked by attendants, the statement added.
According to Thane rural police personnel, the accused principal asked the daughter of one of the complainant parents why she was using a sanitary pad when she was not menstruating, accusing the girl of lying and forcefully taking her thumb impression.
 
 

The police said that action was taken against the school management and administration after several parents protested at the school on Wednesday, seeking “stringent action” against the management and teachers after the girls came home crying and told them about the experience.
“The act by the accused amounts to mental harassment to the girls,” one of the mothers was quoted as saying in her complaint.
According to Indian Express, the police said that one of the parents registered a case against the school principal, four teachers, the attendant and two trustees.
All the accused were booked under sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 76 (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of India’s criminal code, as well as relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has issued directives for strict action against those responsible, Water Minister Girish Mahajan told the state’s legislative assembly, according to Hindustan Times.
A senior police officer said that the arrested — both women — will be produced before the court on Thursday, the report added.

India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.
Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: “Following its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
A statement from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by “Indian-sponsored proxies”.
“Taking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.”
 






The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military’s “baseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat”, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict.
“Invoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India’s self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,” the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.
 
 

The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the “growing propensity for ‘use of force’ as a preferred policy tool”, saying it warranted “persistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve”.
The forum’s members were further briefed on the military’s ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the “evolving threat spectrum and changing character of war”. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for “further strengthening tri-services synergy”.
Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country’s “proactive and successful” diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

“Forum was also briefed on the historic and unique visit of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan’s objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.”
The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed “full confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum”.</p><small>2025-07-10 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1016423617e36ca.jpg?r=164242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N leaders issue conflicting statements on allowing Imran’s sons to enter Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>PML-N leaders have issued differing statements on whether PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons would be allowed entry into Pakistan to run a political movement for their father’s release, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they “can stage protests but within legal limitations”.
Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Kasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this week, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said the two brothers would come to Pakistan as part of an upcoming PTI protest movement.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and and faces pending trials related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ today, Irfan Siddiqui said: “In my personal opinion — as the government has so far not taken any official stance — they should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”
He noted that the sons have spent their entire lives abroad, so they would be “well-aware of what a protest is, how it is staged, and what the boundaries are that we cannot cross”.
“In my opinion, they should not be deprived of this right. If they want to run a movement for their father, then they should,” Siddiqui reiterated.
However, he also hinted at their potential arrests: “If they come here and cross the limitations of laws […] They will also come prepared for that, knowing that ‘if we are fighting the laws, then the law will take its course’.”
 


While Kasim recently posted on X about his father being “fully cut off” from the sons, he has not addressed the matter of joining Pakistan’s politics.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik told Dawn.com that Article 16 was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Article 16 of the Constitution says that “every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.”
“Every country has visa conditions, including visit visas. If the visa conditions are violated, the visa can be cancelled,” he said.
To a question on whether they would be allowed to come to Pakistan, he said the interior ministry would have to look at whether the two had applied for a visa or not or possessed a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis.
He added that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
Last night, he said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals.
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the sons could face arrest if they led a violent movement, while Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said they “should come” to Pakistan.
Siddiqui downplayed the matter altogether, saying that the government was not considering it a “serious issue”. “This will not cause any political upheaval […] there will be no storm if his children come to Pakistan,” he said.
“Why these kids now?” he asked, giving an allegory of taking out two cards that were lying in a pocket deep inside.
He listed that neither Ali Amin Gandapur — the PTI’s only chief minister currently — could do anything for the PTI, nor their protests, or “revolt”, or the call to overseas Pakistanis to halt remittances.
“This card that they are playing will not succeed either. It will aggravate their difficulties because, in the end, politics is to be discussed at the table,” the PML-N senator asserted, referring to the PTI’s demand for Imran’s release.
Regarding talks, the PML-N leader said the only obstacle was Imran himself.
Siddiqui also highlighted various skill challenges that Imran’s sons would face in Pakistan’s political arena.
“Those children have not grown up in Pakistan’s environment at all. They might even melt if you leave them in Karachi’s heat on I.I. Chundrigar Road; those poor kids’ nature is such,” he quipped.
The lawmaker added: “They are maybe not able to speak in Urdu either, so they do not have a language to address this nation.”
However, he acknowledged that their faces were recognisable as they were Imran’s sons. “They are sensible, educated and must be politically well-aware as well.”
Siddiqui termed the potential entry of Imran’s sons into politics as a move to employ emotional appeal.
“They (the sons) are being called because [PTI’s] options within the land of Pakistan have been exhausted,” the lawmaker said, recalling the 2022 mass resignations and the May 9, 2023 riots.
He also pointed out that such a move would go against Imran’s “philosophy that has been against family politics very clearly”.
 
 

Asked by the show hosts whether he was underestimating the sons, given that the PPP’s Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and his sisters entered politics despite having stayed abroad, Siddiqui replied that the latter had still not “gotten a chance to run a movement as the scenario had changed entirely” compared to the dictatorships in the 1900s.
The PML-N leader noted that ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s wife Nusrat and daughter Benazir used to speak in Urdu and participated in a movement.
Jemima slams govt’s ‘plan’ to arrest sons
Meanwhile, Imran’s former spouse, Jemima Goldsmith, assailed the government for potential plans to arrest her sons if they visited Pakistan.
“My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly two years,” she wrote on X.
“Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she noted.
“This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta,” Goldsmith lamented.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least nine people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.
“Over the last 24 hours, four people died and 40 were injured due to rain and winds across the province,” Rescue 1122 Punjab Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement.
Those who sustained serious injuries were immediately transported to a hospital, the spokesperson said.
 


In Sheikhpura’s Mirza Virkaan village, a two-year-old and a five-year-old were killed and two others were injured when a roof collapsed, per the statement.
In Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, a 50-year-old man was killed when a roof collapsed, while two others were injured. A similar incident at a railway station in the city left a two-year-old child dead and hurt two others.
A child was also injured in the Sheikhpura district when a wall collapsed on Jandiala Road. Two people were wounded when a bamboo roof crumbled down in Jhamke village, while one person was hurt in a similar incident in Narang Mandi.
Four people were injured when walls and roofs collapsed in Vehari, while one person was injured in the district’s Chak No. 59WB when solar panels fell on them.
Three people were injured when a roof collapsed in Dera Ghazi Khan, while one person was wounded when a wall caved in in Mankera, a town in Sargodha’s Bhakkar District.
In Attock, a family of six was trapped in their house due to heavy rainfall and urban flooding, and was subsequently injured. Rescue personnel reached the site of the incident and moved everyone to a safe place after providing medical assistance, according to the statement.
Two people were injured in separate incidents when their motorcycle slipped in different localities of Lahore. In the city’s Ashiana Road, one person was killed when a TR girder fell, while two people were wounded in Ichhra’s Ganj Bakhsh when a roof collapsed.
Three people sustained injuries in roof-collapse incidents in Chak 5/4L’s Muzaffar Colony and Chak 6/4L in Okara. One person each was injured in Sahiwal’s Aurangabad and Al-Aman Garden neighbourhoods.
One individual was wounded when a roof collapsed in Sialkot’s Chak Gul Daska, while another was injured in Rajanpur district’s Kotla Malam.
Lahore experiences 7 hours of continuous rainfall: PDMA
Separately, in its daily report, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said Lahore experienced seven hours of continuous downpour on Thursday morning, recording the highest provincial tally with 140mm of rainfall.
Heavy monsoon rainfall is expected in most parts of Punjab over the next 24 hours, the daily report quoted PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia as saying.
The second spell of monsoon rainfall is likely to continue till July 13, it added.
Sialkot recorded 77mm of rainfall, Gujranwala 67mm, Chakwal 65mm, Jhelum 64mm, Hafizabad 60mm, Gujrat 52mm, Mandi Bahauddin 47mm, and Attock 45mm of rainfall.
Faisalabad recorded 51mm of rainfall, Narowal 44mm, Okara 33mm, while Toba Tek Singh and Sheikhupura recorded 25mm each. Rawalpindi and Kasur each recorded 23mm of rainfall, Mangla 19mm, Sargodha 18mm, DG Khan 16mm, Jhang 11mm, Mianwali 10mm, Sahiwal 8mm and Murree 1mm of rainfall.
Heavy rainfall is predicted in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Dera Ghazi Khan, Sahiwal and Mianwali divisions, the report said.

On June 3, Russian Foreign Min­ister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan.
Moscow’s growing engagement with Islamabad — including defe­nce deals, energy cooperation and regular joint military exercises — reflects a strategic shift to diversify partnerships across the region.
In a high-level meeting with Ambassador Fatemi and the prime minister’s aide on Industries and Production, Haroon Akhtar Khan, in Moscow, the Russian DPM reaffirmed his country’s commitment towards deepening bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.
“Characterising Pakistan and Russia as natural allies, [Overchuck] stressed that President Putin considered Pakistan as an important partner in the growth and development of the economy and energy in the region,” the statement said.
“He also highlighted the significance of important connectivity projects between two countries, such as the railway connectivity between Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia, and the launching of a pilot cargo train between Pakistan and Russia in August 2025.”
During the meeting, Fatemi reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening relations with Russia, stressing that strong links with the country were a top priority.
“Pakistan views Russia as a stabilising factor in the international arena,” he added, according to the statement.
Speaking about the New Steel Mills project in Karachi, SAPM Haroon Akhtar — focal point for the project — said the project carries the legacy of Pakistan’s relations with Russia, hailing it as a “leap forward” for future cooperation and partnership.
On May 13, Pakistan and Russia signed an agreement to establish a new steel plant in Karachi, according to a press release from the Press Information Department (PID).
The two sides reviewed engagement across all areas of mutual interest, including political, trade and economic cooperation, as well as energy, connectivity, industrial and agricultural cooperation.
They also discussed recent geopolitical and regional issues such as the situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, and the Middle East. During the recent Indian aggression against Pakistan in May, Russia had offered to mediate between the two countries.
DPM Overchuk shared that President Putin was in favour of strengthening cooperation with Pakistan across all relevant sectors.
He added that President Putin was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in August in the upcoming SCO-Council of Heads of State in Tainjin, China.
In September 2024, Overchuk visited Pakistan, where he met with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar. The two signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) formalising Pakistan and Russia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613354-torrential-rain-floods-lahore-kills-five-across-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Torrential rain floods Lahore, kills five across Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
As part of its $7bn IMF-backed privatisation push, the government approved a “transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel” on Tuesday, saying it won’t do an outright sale but has decided to adopt a joint venture model to maximise long-term value. It gave no further details.
The senior official said the government will retain ownership in the project through an equity partnership, but declined to disclose the size of the stake being offered to any potential JV partner.
The official declined to be named since the process is confidential. JLL, or Jones Lang LaSalle, will run the process and the government is eyeing a valuation of over $1bn for the 42,000 square feet property it hopes could be redeveloped for residential-cum-office use, the official said.
“It is among the best pieces of land in NY real estate … The process begins immediately and is expected to be completed in the next six to nine months,” said the official.
The Privatisation Ministry and state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which owns the hotel through its investment arm, did not respond to requests for comments, and neither did JLL.
Pakistan this week also approved four parties to bid for a stake in debt-ridden PIA.
 
 

The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.
The government is estimating the redevelopment will take 4–5 years, the official said, adding the “interest level is extremely high”.
In June, the government said it expects $100 million in the initial payment from the joint-venture partnership by June 2026.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101310024ebd2da.gif?r=131141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.
“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi wrote on X.
“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.
 






“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.
He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.
Earlier today, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme “Geo Pakistan”, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”
He further said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.
The PML-N leader said his party had “no trouble” working with the president, who leads the PPP, and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.
“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.
Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.
The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
 
 

The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.
In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their concern over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p><small>2025-07-10 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613343-jemima-slams-govt-over-threat-to-arrest-imran-khans-sons' target='_blank'><strong>'Personal vendetta': Jemima slams Shehbaz-led govt over threat to arrest Imran Khan's sons</strong></a><br><p>
