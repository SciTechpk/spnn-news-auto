In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “The newly commissioned, state-of-the-art Pakistan Navy ship Khaibar,  during its maiden voyage from Turkiye to Pakistan, visited Aksaz Naval Base, Turkiye, and participated in exercise Turgutreis-XIII and joint patrols with ships of the Turkish Navy.”
The statement said that during the stay at the naval base, the commanding officer of PNS Khaibar called on the Turkish Southern Sea Area commander.
“During the meeting, discussions focused on enhancing bilateral naval cooperation and fostering regional stability through collaborative efforts,” the statement said.
It added that later, the Southern Sea Area commander and the commander of the Aksaz Naval Base, along with other Turkish naval forces officers, visited PNS Khaibar.
After the port visit, the Pakistan Navy ship participated in the bilateral exercise Turgutreis-XIII with Turkish naval forces ship TCG Heybeliada and a SH-70 helicopter.
“The exercise featured a variety of sea evolutions to rehearse joint maritime operations and enhance interoperability. Upon culmination of the exercise, PNS Khaibar and TCG Heybeliada conducted a coordinated patrol in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea,” he said.
The statement said that the successful conduct of the bilateral exercise Turgutreis-XIII and the coordinated patrol stood as a “testament to the enduring strategic partnership and brotherly ties shared between Pakistan and Turkiye”.</p><small>2026-02-13 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1317504766d5114.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972913/ttap-stages-sit-in-outside-parliament-house-amid-govt-reassurances-over-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP stages sit-in outside Parliament House amid govt reassurances over Imran’s health</strong></a><br><p>A day after revelations emerged about the vision loss of PTI founder Imran Khan, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) reached Parliament House on Friday to stage a sit-in.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Subsequently, the TTAP announced the sit-in outside the Parliament House on Friday (today).
In a post on X, the opposition alliance said that “a sit-in has started outside the parliament house,” vowing that it will “continue until Imran is admitted to Al-Shifa Hospital“.
“No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health,” the TTAP said, adding that all PTI parliamentarians were set to join the sit-in.







Meanwhile, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that PTI lawmakers reached the parliament “after overcoming all the obstacles in their way” ahead of the sit-in.
Qaiser said that he, along with the leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shahram Khan Tarakai, and Shandana Gulzar, reached the assembly.
He added that the “group discussed the present situation and deliberated on the future course of action”.







TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, had earlier claimed that the government “has cordoned off all roads leading to Parliament” ahead of the sit-in.
Khokhar had also claimed that “gates of parliamentary lodges have been shut, trapping MNAs and Senators inside.”
He stressed that the measures were being taken to “stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan.”
“This doesn’t reflect strength, rather weakness,” he added.







Earlier in the day, TTAP chief Achakzai vowed to continue a sit-in outside the parliament— announced in the wake of claims regarding Imran’s vision a day earlier — “until all demands are met”.
He made the demand in a video message posted on TTAP’s X account.







Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry spoke to the media earlier. Asked about the blockade during the media talk, he maintained that the opposition had a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.”
He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”.
“There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added.
Chaudhry, during his media talk, gave assurance that the PTI founder would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”.
Addressing the media outside Parliament, Chaudhry said: “Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.”
“If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added.
He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.”
He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”.
Addressing the claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.”
“The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said.
He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”.
He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC.
He added that a new medical report will be issued soon.
The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”.
PTI asks SC to issue written orders
Separately, PTI, in a post on X, addressed the CJP, demanding “formal written directions” for the PTI founder’s health examination.
“CJP, we require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” the party said.
It called on the CJP to “issue and release the written orders,” stressing that Imran needed “urgent eye treatment.”
“This is not politics, this is not about power. This is about Imran Khan’s life,” PTI added.







Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, in a post on X, also said that the family had not yet received a written order from the SC regarding the PTI founder’s eye inspection.
“It is 1pm on Friday the 13th, and we still have not received the written order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. We require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” Aleema said.
She said that despite the court’s deadline of February 16, the “directive cannot be implemented without a written order from the court.”
“Given the urgency and the risk to his eyesight, why has the CJP delayed issuing the written orders?” she added.







Awaam Pakistan to join TTAP’s sit-in
Separately, the leadership of Awaam Pakistan — Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail — announced that it will participate in TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament House.
“The peaceful protest is being staged in response to the alleged deprivation of vision in Imran Khan’s one eye, and the government’s refusal to allow access to his personal doctors and family.”







The TTAP further said the decision was made last night in a meeting also attended by Awaam Pakistan’s leadership.
“Denying any prisoner timely and appropriate medical care is immoral, inhumane and illegal,” the opposition alliance said, adding that Imran Khan was Pakistan’s former prime minister and the leader of the “country’s largest political party”.
“The Awaam Pakistan party will join TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament immediately after Friday prayers today.”
“We firmly believe in the rule of law, the people’s constitutional rights, free and fair elections, and true democracy, and we will always stand with the people in their struggle for these principles,” the post said.
Dr Zafar Mirza, central spokesperson of Awaam Pakistan party, in a social media post on X, said, “Imran Khan’s eyesight is at risk without urgent medical treatment! Awaam Pakistan is part of the peaceful protest of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and will stay until he receives the medical care he legally deserves.”

Lawmakers from the opposition gathered in front of the chairman’s podium and chanted slogans against the government for what they called the inhumane treatment of a high-profile prisoner.
The protest came a day after Barrister Salman Safdar’s report claimed that Imran Khan’s right eye had left with only 15pc vision due to a delay in imparting treatment.
During the Senate session, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed that the PTI founding chairman complained for the first time about an eye issue in the first week of January, contrary to the claim of PTI that their founder had been complaining about this for the past four months.
He emphasised that medical treatment was provided promptly, without any delay. He further noted that the treatment administered was properly documented. Sanaullah advised PTI not to do politics on the health of its founding chairman.
“Jail doctors examine the PTI founding chairman every second day as part of routine medical care,” he asserted. He said separate medical boards had reviewed his health condition twenty-five times.
Sanaullah said there was no reference to his eye ailment in the medical board held on December 9, 2025.
He further said that the counsels met the PTI founding chairman on December 20 on the occasion of the Toshakhana-II Case verdict and at that time, he did not refer to the eye ailment. He pointed out that PTI lawyer Safdar was also present on the occasion.
“If the PTI has any suggestions regarding the medical care of its founding chairman, it should approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” the PML-N leader said, assuring that any directions issued by the apex court would be fully implemented.
Sanaullah said the report submitted to the Supreme Court clearly established that the PTI founding chairman himself was satisfied with the living conditions in the prison.
Senate opposition leader, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, noted that the PTI founder’s health issue should be viewed on humanitarian grounds.
“Let’s go together and meet him. We will go see him and report back to the Senate. Let people meet him, things will normalise,” he remarked.
Abbas called for burying dirty politics and said new traditions should be set. He insisted that criminal negligence had been committed while treating Imran.
He asserted that the doctor who examined the PTI founder was not a retina specialist.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl parliamentary leader Senator Kamran Murtaza said that the former prime minister’s eyesight was under threat. He endorsed the proposal that representatives from the opposition and government meet him.
Murtaza said that while injustices may have been committed in the past, they should not be committed now.
He said the options available for Imran included parole, bail, moving him to a hospital or declaring his house as a sub-jail.
“Take the path that earns us respect in global democracies,” he said.
He said medical treatment was the constitutional right of every citizen, including the former prime minister, under Article 9.</p><small>2026-02-13 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650655-islamabad-red-zone-sealed-as-opposition-stages-sit-in-outside-parliament-over-imrans-health-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad Red Zone sealed as opposition stages sit-in outside parliament over Imran's health concerns</strong></a><br><p>

The Pakistan National Report 2025 was released by the GMMP’s Pakistan partner, Uks Research Centre. It was based on the monitoring of the news landscape on May 6 last year — a day “marked by severe military and political tensions along the Line of Control with India” — which shaped the news content and the visibility of women across different platforms.
“The data captures not just a single day’s news, but the outcome of decades of institutional and societal factors that shape women’s visibility in Pakistani media,” the report said, adding, “On a day that was dominated by overwhelming national security coverage, these findings show broader systemic trends.”
According to the report, the monitoring was based on nine print newspapers, six television channels, the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation radio channel, and four news-based websites. Thirteen volunteers participated in the monitoring, including Uks staff and students from various universities.
It found that women constituted only 11 per cent of news subjects across traditional media (print, television and radio), reflecting “their marginalisation in the coverage of politics, economy, crime, and sports”.
Across these platforms, they appeared most frequently in arts, culture, and celebrity reporting (60pc) and science and health (28pc), but were nearly absent in the hard-news areas highlighted above, ranging from 0-10pc in each area as well as in Gender-Based Violence (GBV) coverage.
However, digital media platforms highlighted greater inclusivity, as women made up 26pc of subjects in internet news. They were also visible in politics (23pc), science and health (33pc), social and legal issues (33pc), and were “central” to all monitored GBV stories (100pc).
“These findings illustrate a consistent platform-based gap, with online news offering women a higher likelihood of visibility,” the report stated.
It further said that the role of women in news production remained “extremely limited”, with men dominating reporting roles across all media.
Notably, in print, bylines by women comprised 5pc of the total, while radio showed 100pc female reporting on the monitoring day — although the report warned against generalisation due to a small sample size.
The report added that of the 29pc of news reported or presented by women, 96pc of them served as anchors or presenters and only 4pc were field reporters.
“Women reporters were largely absent from producing stories about men as subjects. On the other hand, men reported almost all the stories that featured women subjects,” it added.
GBV coverage on the monitoring day was limited, with only a single story recorded in traditional media. Online outlets, however, addressed sexual harassment and technology-facilitated violence and often also talked about broader gender inequality and rights-based perspectives, it said.
Meanwhile, women’s visibility as central subjects was limited, with only 15pc of news stories featuring women as the main focus, according to the report. Women’s news subjects primarily represented government officials or politicians and were rarely in roles providing personal experience or as experts.
In addition, the report highlighted that women were identified by their family roles or status in 15pc of cases compared to only 2pc for men.
A greater percentage of men were reported as victims, while photographs “disproportionately showed men” over women, and direct quotes were overwhelmingly given by men, with only 10.5pc of quotes attributed to women.
“Overall, only 1pc of the news content challenged gender stereotypes, and only 1pc of stories highlighted issues of gender equality or inequality between women and men,” it said.
According to the report’s executive summary, the findings “confirm patterns that have continued to endure in Pakistani news”.
However, they also highlighted the potential of digital media platforms to “create professional opportunities for women in journalism and to frame issues through a gendered and rights-based lens”, which in turn would improve their visibility and representation in media.</p><small>2026-02-13 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13155251c1fa053.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972920/zimbabwe-pull-off-shock-win-over-australia-at-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Zimbabwe pull off shock win over Australia at T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Zimbabwe beat a depleted Australia by 23 runs on Friday in Colombo to pull off the biggest shock of the T20 World Cup so far.
After posting 169-2 in their 20 overs, thanks mainly to Brian Bennett’s classy 64 not out, Zimbabwe had Australia 29-4 before dismissing them for 146 in 19.3 overs.
The Zimbabweans, ranked 11th were always in control against their second-ranked opponents in the Group B game at R. Premadasa Stadium after opening bowlers Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans ripped out Australia’s top order.
There were sensational scenes at the venue as a group of Zimbabwe fans dressed in their team jerseys celebrated the win with a traditional dance.







“It is a huge win for us,” said Bennett.
“There are fans who have come all the way from Zimbabwe and they have enjoyed the game and it is a special feeling today to get a win here.”
Muzarabani was the pick of the bowlers finishing with 4-17.
“I was really happy that today really came off,” said Muzarabani, who was named player of the match.
“I also believe that everyone really bowled well. We missed Richi (Ngarava), but Brad (Evans) really bowled well.
The next step
“It’s really good to beat Australia, but it will also be nice to qualify for the Super Eights. So we’ll be thinking about the next step.”
Australia retained hope of a rearguard victory when Glenn Maxwell and Matt Renshaw put on 77 for the fifth wicket.
But once part-time leg-spinner Ryan Burl induced one of the short game’s great players, Maxwell, to drag on to his stumps for 31, they were never in the hunt and tumbled from 106-4 to 146 all out.
Opening batsman Bennett’s unbeaten 64 off 56 balls was an exercise in controlled aggression as he rarely went the aerial route and found the boundary seven times.
It was the 22-year-old’s 10th half-century in T20 internationals.
“It was the type of wicket you have to do the hard yards,” said Bennett.
Zimbabwe thrashed Oman in their opener and their last two group games will be against Ireland and Sri Lanka.
Co-hosts Sri Lanka have also won both their matches so far.
“We are in a good position to go to the next round having won two out of two,” said Bennett.
Ryan Burl and Bennett put on 70 for the second wicket, a record stand for Zimbabwe in T20 World Cups after an opening partnership of 61 with Tadiwanashe Marumani.
Australia beat Ireland on Wednesday, but with matches to come against Sri Lanka and Oman, another defeat could see them on the plane home after the group stage.
Without their captain Mitchell Marsh for the second match, and the previously ruled out pace spearheads Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, Australia’s campaign in the 20-nation tournament is in danger of falling apart at the first hurdle.
The former champions were left with more to worry as Marcus Stoinis was struck on his left palm attempting a return catch halfway through his third over.
The all-rounder was accompanied off the field in pain. He did come out to bat but scored only six.
“Stoinis was going to bat higher and him not being able to bat higher was a blow,” said Renshaw, who top scored with 65.
“Medical staff will examine how bad is his injury. We weren’t good enough today. There is time for flair in T20 cricket.
“We had to rebuild,” he added.
“But we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. It wasn’t our day and we are bitterly disappointed.”
The only bright spot was power batter Tim David being named in the team after missing the Ireland win.
But he made a two-ball duck in his first game since suffering a hamstring injury in the Big Bash League on December 26.</p><small>2026-02-13 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13150604a50758d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917/first-day-of-ramazan-likely-to-fall-on-february-19-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>First day of Ramazan likely to fall on February 19: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said on Friday that the first day of Ramazan is “likely to fall” on February 19, 2026.
The new moon is expected to be born on Feb 17, 2026, at 5:01pm, according to the statement by the space agency.
“At the time of sunset on Feb 18, 2026, the age of the new moon will be approximately 25 hours and 48 minutes. The time duration between sunset and moonset is expected to be 59 minutes along the coastal areas of the country,” added the Suparco statement.
“Consequently, the 1st of Ramazan may likely to fall on 19 Feb 2026.”
However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.
Earlier this week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) stated that there is a “fair chance” of sighting the new moon of Ramazan on the evening of February 18.
“According to astronomical parameters, there is a ‘fair chance’ of sighting the new moon of Ramazan 1447 AH on the evening of February 18, 2026,” it said.
Furthermore, the weather is expected to be partly cloudy or fair in most parts of the country on Feb 18, it added.</p><small>2026-02-13 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650617-any-lapse-in-imran-khans-treatment-would-amount-to-criminal-negligence-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Any lapse in Imran Khan's treatment will amount to criminal negligence: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

But final official results are yet to come and BNP’s main rival Jamaat-i-Islami — leading a wider coalition — said it had “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.
The Jamuna television channel projected that the BNP had secured 212 seats.
It said Jamaat had won 74, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for. Somoy TV broadcast similar figures.

According to PMD’s National Seismic Monitoring Centre, the earthquake struck at 6:30am at a depth of 13 km, 86km northeast of Khuzdar.
It was preceded by another earthquake — magnitude 3.8 — that struck 75km southeast of Khuzdar at 5:52am at a depth of 33km.
Tremors were felt in several districts of Sindh as well, APP reported, including Sukkur, Qambar, Shahdadkot, and Dadu, while Jhal Magsi, Jaffarabad and Nasirabad in Balochistan reported tremors as well.
Last month, an earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
A 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country in January. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.

Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said.

The opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.
The Election Commission put the BNP at 181 seats, the Jamaat-i-Islami at 61 and others at 7, with full official results not expected before noon (11am PKT) on Friday.
The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.
“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.
A clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.
“A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,” Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told Reuters.
BNP leader Tarique Rahman is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party’s founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, he returned in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.



In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.
“If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, thats what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,” Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told Reuters after the results.

BNP supporters celebrate overnight
The Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was “not satisfied” with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.
Now in exile in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
The BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina’s Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.
But elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.
Overnight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party’s landslide became clear.
Turnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with media nearly 60pc of registered voters participated in the election on Thursday.

More than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Broadcaster Jamuna TV said more than 2 million voters chose “Yes”, while more than 850,000 said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.
The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.
President, PM felicitate BNP on election win
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Tarique Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.
According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.







Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.
President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.
He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.
The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”







The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.
“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.







India’s Modi congratulates Bangladesh’s BNP
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the BNP led by Tarique Rahman on Friday on its “decisive victory” in elections.
“This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” Modi said in a statement posted on social media, referring to Rahman.







“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh.”

The party, led by Tarique Rahman, will return to power after 20 years. Rahman, the son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister.
Here are some of the key promises made by the BNP in its election manifesto, which has the motto ‘Bangladesh before all’:
Reforms
The party aims to implement all points of the July Charter, which sought to create new constitutional bodies, introduce a bicameral parliament, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.

Trade
One of the key promises made includes undertaking initiatives to restart closed industries and diversify the export sector. The party has also vowed to undertake measures so that legally operating foreign businesses can repatriate their stipulated profits to their home countries within 30 days.
Employment
On employment, the BNP has promised to create nearly 1 million new jobs in the information and communication technology sector. They have also promised to ensure fair, price-index-based wages in line with inflation and a review system to be launched every two years.
The party has said that it will develop technical and language skills among the youth and ensure merit-based government recruitment.

Economy
BNP has promised to introduce international payment systems, establish regional e-commerce hubs and boost ‘Make in Bangladesh’. Another key priority includes the launch of a ‘Family Card’ for low-income families with monthly provisions to buy essential commodities.
Health
On health, the party said it will increase public spending on health to 5 per cent of GDP gradually and promised to recruit 100,000 health workers across the country and expand preventive healthcare programmes.
Social
BNP has promised to launch a mid-day meal program for students and a new skills and values-based education policy for schools. The party also pledged to build better sports infrastructure and training facilities.
Additionally, it plans to set up training-based welfare programs for religious leaders of all faiths at places of worship.</p><small>2026-02-13 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650596-pakistani-artists-hand-painted-animation-lights-up-times-square' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani artist's hand-painted animation lights up Times Square</strong></a><br><p>

Authors of the draft legislation from the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) say it is needed to protect children from cyberbullying, harmful content and predatory individuals.
A public system known as Digital Mobile Key (DMK) will be used by parents to give consent, also helping to enforce the existing ban for children under the age of 13 to access digital social media, video- and image-sharing platforms, or online betting sites.

 

Tech providers are also required to implement an age verification system compatible with the DMK.
The bill, approved by 148–69 votes with 13 abstentions, can still be modified before the final vote.
France’s lower house last month backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks.
Australia’s world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube came into force in December.
The Portuguese bill says it will fill a regulatory gap that has allowed “multinational digital platforms to set rules unilaterally”, affecting children’s cognitive and emotional development, particularly with early or excessive exposure.
It says that over the past two decades, social media have assumed roles long held by families and schools without regulation.
“We have to protect our children…we don’t intend to prohibit for the sake of prohibiting, we intend to create a norm to give more power to parents and families, to accompany and control,” PSD lawmaker Paulo Marcelo said before the vote.
He said that tech companies ignoring the restrictions could face fines of up to 2 per cent of their global revenue.</p><small>2026-02-13 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/131048340edf126.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972900/policeman-kidnapped-in-bannu-house-set-on-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman kidnapped in Bannu, house set on fire</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Militants allegedly kidnapped a CPEC policeman and set his house on fire in the Dogar Umarzai area in Bannu district, destroying three rooms and household belongings.
Local sources reported that around 40 to 50 armed militants entered the house, abducted the constable, and later set the house ablaze.
According to police sources, the kidnapped constable has been identified as Qadeer who was serving in the CPEC Police.
The incident caused panic and fear among the family members and residents of the area.
Authorities stated that investigations are underway from multiple angles.
Firing incident at journalist’s residence
In a separate incident, unidentified motorcyclists opened fire at the residence of the former president of Bannu Press Club and ARY News correspondent Ihsan Khattak late on Thursday night.
Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
Khattak stated that suspicious motorcyclists had previously been seen around his residence, after which he had submitted an application against unidentified individuals at Saddar Police Station.
He clarified that he has no personal enmity or dispute with anyone.
The journalist further revealed that in the past, he had received threatening phone calls from Afghan numbers in connection with his reporting duties.
Journalistic circles strongly condemned the incident and demanded an immediate and transparent investigation from the police to bring those involved to justice and ensure the safety of journalists.</p><small>2026-02-13 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650575-ex-army-chief-bajwa-stable-after-treatment-for-heart-block-related-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Bajwa stable after treatment for heart block-related fall: source</strong></a><br><p>

All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation.
Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone.







“Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations.
“It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said.
The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said.
“Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.”
The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP.







The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups.
While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.”
Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions.
On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region.
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat.
Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban.
TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat.
The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region.
ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions.
Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources.
The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime.
Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.</p><small>2026-02-13 05:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/130911042137a88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972786/railways-nlc-to-upgrade-ml-2-as-dedicated-freight-corridor' target='_blank'><strong>Railways, NLC to upgrade ML-2  as dedicated freight corridor</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Pakistan Railways (PR) and the National Logistics Corporation (NLC) have joined hands to upgrade the Main Line-2 (ML-2) as dedicated freight corridor, enabling the authorities to transport goods to several cities in the country within short time.
The dedicated freight corridor project will cost around $2 billion, according to Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi.
“We had an important meeting with the NLC authorities on Thursday wherein we both agreed to start working for developing a dedicated freight corridor at the ML-2 starting from Kotri and ending at Attock. For this, we agreed to appoint an international consultant to carry out feasibility and other preparatory works ahead of executing this vital project,” Mr Abbasi explained while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“The project will cost around $2bn that will be arranged by NLC on its own by getting financed through banks or funding agencies,” he revealed.
It merits mentioning that the ML-2 is an important route measuring nearly 1,250 kilometers. There are over 90 operational railway stations from Kotri to Attock, including many in interior Sindh. The important stations situated on the route include Kotri, Sehwan Sharif, Dadu, Mohenjodaro, Larkana, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, Habibkot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kandkot, Kot Mithan, Rajanpur, Jampur, DG Khan, Shadan Lund, Bhakkar, Piplan, Mianwali, Jand and Attock City.

NLC to arrange $2bn through banks or funding agencies

The minister said the ML-2 [upgrade] project would have a new and a dedicated track for the goods/freight trains with various other modern facilities.
Talking about the launch of the phase-1 (Karachi-Rohri) of the ML-1 project, he said the PR is trying hard for the ground breaking of this mega scheme in July this year. “The phase-1 of ML-1 projects consists of 480km. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already agreed to finance the ML-1’s phase-1. The financing arrangements for rest of the phases of ML-1 scheme are also being done in collaboration with other international funding institutions,” he maintained.
Mr Abbasi said the work on the rehabilitation/upgrade of the ML-3 project (Rohri-Taftan via Sibbi and Quetta) is expected to begin in April, this year. This route measuring over 1,000km is very important especially in terms of international freight operations (Pakistan to Turkiye via Iran).
Meanwhile, PR’s Chief Executive Officer Mr Amir Ali Baloch confirmed that various teams of the ADB had visited the ML-1’s phase-1 project sites (Karachi-Rohri) three times, advancing the pace of funding-related works. “The detailed discussions have already been held with the bank authorities. And now we are very hopeful of starting work in July this year,” he told Dawn when contacted.
He said the $6.7 billion ML-1 project would be executed in phases, starting from Karachi-Rohri section first.

The remains of the 16th century historical building were situated roughly 200 meters from the British-era obelisk, at an archaeological site in Rehara village.
A few days ago, the World War I memorial that stood here was razed by developers to make way for a private housing society.
According to the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM), the structure was possibly built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, and was the oldest historical ruin in this region.
A DOAM official told Dawn the building’s above-ground arch (façade) and the remaining structure (the 8x4.5 meters main chamber and its 1.5 meters thick walls), constructed with limestone and sandstone blocks, which required careful excavation, had been demolished.

Demolition comes days after British-era World War I monument was felled by developers in the same area

A departmental team that later visited the site found that the remnants of the historical structure, which are clearly visible in photographs taken earlier, had been entirely wiped out.
According to documents seen by Dawn, DOAM had written to the Capital Development Authority (CDA), which is the developing partner of the housing scheme, to provide records that would enable the department to protect the historical sites.
DOAM claimed it had been writing to CDA’s revenue department since 2020, seeking a record of the war memorial and a few other historical sites, including the Mughal-era Rehara structure.
“The CDA has not once responded to the numerous letters DOAM has written in the last six years,” an official from the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture told Dawn.
Dawn reached out to CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiyani. After initially seeking time to prepare a response, the spokesperson did not answer further queries or provide a comment.
Interestingly, a number of DOAM officials when approached for their comments remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official, however, requesting anonymity, said that a report of the destruction of the monuments had been sent to the Prime Minister’s Office a couple of days ago.
It is worth noting that DOAM has also taken a U-turn on the felling of the World War I monument, saying that it was not protected under the Antiquities Act 1975 and, therefore, a no-objection certificate (NOC) was not required for tearing it down.
Earlier, DOAM had claimed that it did not permit CDA to demolish the monuments.
The department said that although the monument was located within Islamabad Capital Territory, efforts were being made to bring it under formal protection. However, due to the non-availability of required finances and other legal prerequisites, the memorial could not be notified as a protected site.
“Nevertheless, the monument possesses cultural and historical significance. In line with internationally recognised best practices for commemorative and historical structures, DOAM was consulted and provided advisory guidance to let first protect the monument under the Antiquities Act 1975, but it was not done.
The department emphasised that any handling of the memorial should be undertaken with due care, dignity, and conservation sensitivity to preserve and safeguard its historical value,” DOAM had said in its statement earlier, adding, “It is better to re-erect the monument at the same place with grace and dignity as it was erected for the same village of Rehara”.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the United States and Iran to move towards direct negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
“Whilst we stand ready to participate in any format of dialogue and diplomacy on Iran, we encourage the relevant parties to have as direct a negotiation framework as possible,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
The indirect Iran-US talks took place in Muscat on Feb 6 amid heightened regional tensions, including an expanded US military presence and warnings from President Donald Trump of severe consequences if no deal is reached.
The session was mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who shuttled between the two sides. Both sides described the discussions as a “good start”.
A follow-up visit by Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, took place in Muscat around Feb 9-10 to discuss next steps.
No date or venue has been for­mally announced for the next rou­nd of talks, though both sides have signalled their intention to continue discussions pending consultations in their respective capitals.
On Thursday, Mr Andrabi said Islamabad hoped the momentum generated in Muscat would continue. “We hope the positivity (in Oman talks) would be carried forward by the parties in the conduct of these talks,” he noted.
Diplomatic efforts
“Pakistan welcomes the talks in Oman between relevant parties. We support all initiatives of dialogue and diplomacy to settle
outstanding issues, including this question of nuclear talks,” Mr Andrabi said. He called the development “a positive progression towards a negotiated solution”. During the briefing, Mr Andrabi was asked specifically about Pakistan’s role in the Muscat process, but he did not directly address whether Islamabad had facilitated contacts or participated behind the scenes. However, he reiterated that Pakistan supports dialogue and would be ready to participate “in any format”, if requested.
Before Oman, talks between the US and Iran were originally slated to be held in Istanbul, where a host of regional players were also expected to take part. When Tehran asked for a change of venue and sought to limit the agenda of the talks, it also limited the scope for engagement by regional players, such as Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Diplomatic sources said that a top Pakistani official had visited Oman, and met with US envoy Steve Witkoff on the sidelines of the dialogue process, but there was no official confirmation in this regard.
Since June last year, Pakistan has acknowledged acting as a messenger between Tehran and Washington, something which was also confirmed by the Foreign Office.
Immediately after the Muscat talks, Iran’s ambassador in Islamabad had called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to brief him on Tehran’s position. Days later, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Mr Dar spoke by phone.
According to Iranian accounts of the call, Mr Araghchi explained Tehran’s positions regarding what it described as a fair and just agreement and elaborated on the process of indirect negotiations in Muscat. Mr Dar wished success for the negotiations and emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to support diplomacy.
The spokesman also pointed to recent high-level contacts between Islamabad and Tehran. “Our deputy prime minister and foreign minister spoke twice with his Iranian counterpart. We are maintaining close contact at the leadership level,” he said, adding that the prime minister had a conversation with the Iranian president in the recent past. “Our support for dialogue and diplomacy continues,” he added.
‘Board of Peace’ meeting
Mr Andrabi also confirmed that PM Shehbaz Sharif will attend the inaugural meeting of President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ next week, saying Pakistan would use the platform to push for a just and lasting solution to the Palestine issue.
The leaders-level meeting of the Board of Peace is scheduled for Feb 19 in Washington. It will mark the first formal gathering of the multinational body since its charter was signed during a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan 22.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister,” Mr Andrabi told the weekly media briefing.
“As regards the other members of the delegation and on engagements of the delegation in the US, we will inform you in due course of time,” he said when asked to comment on reports that Field Marshal Munir would also join the prime minister at the session.
US officials and media reports suggest the Feb 19 summit will focus on fundraising for Gaza’s reconstruction, implementation of ceasefire phases including transitional governance and security arrangements, and clarification of the board’s broader mandate and structure.
“We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith. We are in it, not in isolation, not as one voice, but as a collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries,” Mr Andrabi said, referring to two statements that were issued by these countries, not just on Gaza, but also on the West Bank.
“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.”
“So, our engagement is for short-, medium- and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he maintained.

ISLAMABAD: The PTI raised alarm over the treatment meted out to former prime minister Imran Khan in jail in light of a health report submitted to the Supreme Court, with its leaders calling out the “medical neglect” that worsened the situation.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar used the report to point out that the PTI chief had been enjoying all facilities in jail, as evident from his diet plan outlined in the document submitted to the apex court.
PTI lawyer Salman Safdar had submitted the report, which claimed that Mr Khan had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye, after meeting Mr Khan in jail on the directions of the SC.
Amid these reports about their leader’s health, PTI leaders, including Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, held a press conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, terming the situation alarming.
The CM said Imran Khan had informed au­­thorities a number of times about the problem with his vision, but no one bothered ab­­out it. “When his eyesight was lost, he was ta­­ken to the hospital. It was nothing but a criminal act because, had they allowed the meeting with the family and lawyers, the hea­lth issue would have been highlighted,” he said.
The CM said Mr Khan had never demanded relief on the basis of health, but “now we are saying this because there is a possibility of irreversible loss”.
He said that when the health of Nawaz Sharif was discussed during his imprisonment, the judiciary and media had raised their voices for him.
“At that time, Imran Khan had allowed him [Nawaz Sharif] to go for treatment. At this time, we are unable to hear similar voices from the judiciary and the media. One media outlet had raised the health issue (of Mr Khan), due to which a federal minister had to confirm it,” he said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that he had never seen such a thing in the history of Pakistan.
“…When eyesight was lost, the administrator of the jail was changed, and the new administrator also took 10 days to send him [Imran Khan] to the hospital.” He demanded that Mr Khan be allowed to be examined by his personal physician, saying that they did not trust the government with his treatment.
PTI leader Junaid Akbar Khan warned that while the party leadership had asked its supporters to exercise restraint, it could not control them indefinitely. “The day our workers come out without our call, you will not be able to run,” he warned, cautioning that frustration among PTI’s youth base was fast approaching a tipping point.
Mr Akbar said Imran Khan had never publicly complained about his health, but the party now considered his medical condition a matter of utmost urgency.
Moreover, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram demanded that cases be registered against the officers concerned, including the former Adiala superintendent and senior prison officials, for medical neglect so that they could be held accountable. “Negligence in Imran Khan’s treatment is unacceptable. Public anger is rising and the situation could soon get out of control,” he said in a statement.
‘Direct consequence’
Meanwhile, Imran’s son Kasim Khan, in a post on X, termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”. He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added.
He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.
Separately, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, along with opposition leaders, said that the report presented before the Supreme Court was deeply alarming. He demanded that meetings be allowed with the family, party leaders and doctors and that medical treatment be ensured.
‘Fallen flat’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaul­lah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family had “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of Imran Khan’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face. “The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.

In an income tax reference, titled Commissioner Inland Revenue versus Sajid Hussain Gondal and others, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Jawad Hassan laid down guidance on the scope and limits of amendment powers under Section 122, bringing long-awaited doctrinal clarity to a provision frequently invoked by tax authorities.
The reference application, filed under Section 133 of the ordinance, challenged an order of the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR), which had set aside an amendment made to a taxpayer’s deemed assessment for tax year 2019. The tribunal had earlier ruled that the FBR’s use of Section 122(5A) in the case was unlawful.

 

The taxpayer, Sajid Hussain Gondal, had filed an income tax return for 2019, which became a deemed assessment under Section 120 of the ordinance. Subsequently, the Additional Commissioner of Inland Revenue issued a show-cause notice under Sections 122(9), 111(1), and 122(5A), alleging discrepancies in declared gross revenue, purchases under Section 236A, deductions under Section 153, profit and loss expenses, and capital declarations.
The tax department claimed that these discrepancies rendered the deemed assessment erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue, justifying an amendment under Section 122(5A). Despite the taxpayer’s explanation, the assessment was amended in June 2022, an action later upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) but ultimately struck down by the ATIR in November 2023.
In a detailed ruling, the LHC reaffirmed that a deemed assessment under Section 120 cannot be unsettled lightly and drew a clear legal boundary between Section 122(5) and Section 122(5A).
It said Section 122(5) applies where an amendment is based on audit findings or definite information indicating escaped income, under-assessment, misclassification or excessive relief. By contrast, Section 122(5A) is revisional in nature and can be invoked only when the assessment order is both erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue.
The bench stressed that both conditions must coexist, and that mere suspicion, arithmetic mismatch or perceived revenue loss does not meet the statutory threshold.
Justice Rauf observed that Section 122(5A) does not grant open-ended authority to revisit assessments. Rather, it is meant to correct glaring and apparent errors committed by the assessing officer where such errors are demonstrably harmful to revenue.
“The revisional jurisdiction under Section 122(5A) is not a licence for roving or fishing inquiries,” the high court held, adding that the alleged error must be evident from the record, and the claimed prejudice must be legally demonstrable, not conjectural.

ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a meeting at the Presidency on Thursday to take stock of the political and security situation amid purported plans for convening a joint session of parliament in which some important pieces of legislation are expected to be tabled, besides discussions on rising incidents of terrorism.
A source told Dawn that the premier met the president because the government wanted to call a joint session of parliament. However, it was not clear what would be on the agenda of this sitting.
During the session, a debate on terrorism is also expected. It is likely that some top military officials could brief the house on terrorism, and the session might turn into an in-camera sitting.
The source also said the president and his team conveyed their displeasure to the prime minister over new net-metering regulations introduced by the Natio­nal Electric Power Regulatory Authority.
The PM was accompanied by a group of federal ministers, while the president was accompanied by legislators and senior party leaders.
According to a statement by the Presidency, the two sides reviewed the political, economic and security situation as well as the prevailing regional and global environment.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister for Economic Affairs Division Senator Ahad Cheema, PM’s adviser Touqeer Shah, PM’s aide on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, Senator Sherry Rehman and Raja Pervez Ashraf.
Allowance for attorneys
Meanwhile, President Zardari appro­ved an amendment introducing a special allowance for long-serving additional attorneys general. The president signed the summary on the advice of the PM, approving an amendment to the terms and conditions of service of additional, deputy and assistant attorneys general.
The amendment introduces a special allowance for additional attorneys general who have served for more than 10 years in the capacity of assistant attorney general.
The measure is intended to recognise sustained service within the law officers’ cadre and to provide structured financial consideration for those who have completed over a decade in the role of assistant attorney general before elevation. The amendment will take effect in accordance with the approved summary.
In a separate meeting with a four-member delegation of Turkiye’s Agricultural Technologies Cluster (TUME), led by its Board Chairman Abdulkadir Karagoz, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan desired to strengthen its relations with Turkiye and enhance bilateral economic partnership, particularly in the agriculture and livestock sectors.

The minister acknowledged that the high electricity tariffs had been pushing the consumers away from the grid and solar penetration had created a serious challenge to the grid. Therefore, the government was considering restructuring of the power sector debt, besides taking measures for curtailing peak demand.
Over the past few months, the government has taken up the restructuring of power sector debt with multilateral lenders, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, including a $30bn Chinese debt for longer duration. A circular debt of Rs1.6 trillion and a Rs1.225tr recent financing with local commercial banks are also on the agenda.
Pakistan’s repeated direct requests to Chinese institutions for extension in debt repayment period have remained fruitless for well over five years. The authorities have therefore been looking at refinancing of even the Chinese debt and domestic commercial debts with the banking sector to longer terms — 15-20 year concessional multilateral debt.

Power minister says rapid switchover to solar power has created ‘serious challenge’ for national grid

They estimated such a large-scale refinancing of power sector debt could bring down overall tariffs, particularly for industry, to 8-9 cents per unit from 11.5 cents per unit at present.
Mr Leghari said clean energy contribution to the national generation basket had reached 55pc in FY2025 and was estimated to cross 90pc by 2035. He said solar penetration had created a challenge for the national grid where daytime demand dipped to around 8,000MW, but went beyond 26,000MW during peak hours as the government policy encouraged households to invest their incomes and belongings in rooftop solar systems.
In such a situation, power plants are required to be kept on standby to meet peak demand. He said this “people-led solar revolution” had earned global accolades for Pakistan in leading a clean energy transition. He, however, noted that unfair pricing transfer was converting solarisation into a burden for other consumers and this “needs to be rationalised”.
The power minister said electricity prices had come down by 20pc over the last 18-20 months and despite imposition of fixed charges on households, residential tariff was still 35-40pc subsidised. In addition, the industrial power tariff had been cut by 35pc and brought down to around 11.5 cents per unit, which required to be brought down further to be internationally competitive.
The managing director of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority said the government had given a target for launching the fan replacement scheme within 90 days and his agency had been able to complete all preparation for formal operationalisation in 81 days.
The project involves the State Bank and commercial banks through a tripartite agreement for the launch of the Prime Minister’s Fan Replacement Programme with a government rolling guarantee of Rs2bn to insure first installment default.
Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik said the scheme would help reduce carbon footprint, reduce energy costs to consumers and reduce peak summer demand and contribute to climate resilience. He said replacement of an old fan with new efficient plant could help reduce energy bill by Rs12,000 per year.

Delegations from at least 20 countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting in Washington, DC, which Trump will chair on February 19, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Trump signed documents in Davos, Switzerland, on January 23 establishing the Board of Peace. The board’s creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump’s Gaza plan.

 

While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Pakistan and Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.

Feb 19 huddle will seek monetary contributions for Gaza reconstruction

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, during his visit to Washington, that Israel has joined the board.
Trump has stirred concerns that the Board of Peace might try to resolve other conflicts around the world and compete with the United Nations. The US officials said the meeting next week will focus solely on Gaza.
They said a central part of the meeting will be Trump’s announcement of a multi-billion-dollar fund for Gaza, which will include monetary contributions from participating board members.
One official called the offers “generous” and said that the United States had not made any explicit requests for donations. “People have come to us offering,” the official said. “The president will make announcements vis a vis the money raised.”
Stabilisation force
The deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) is a key part of the next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan, announced in September. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year-old war began on October 10. According to the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over all prisoners and bodies, while Israel has also freed detained Palestinians.
At the board meeting, Trump is likely to announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead, the officials said.
A primary concern for now is disarming Hamas, which has opposed plans to disarm until the Israeli occupation ends.
Under Trump’s plan, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries, under the plan.
The Board of Peace meetings will also include detailed reports on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which was established to take over the day-to-day civil administration of Gaza Strip from Hamas. The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.
Other updates will cover humanitarian aid for Gaza as well as the Gaza police, the officials said.

The development came hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the PTI.
The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Videos shared by the TTAP on the social media platform X on Thursday night showed Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speaking to the media alongside the PTI leadership.
“After Friday prayers, we will stage a sit-in outside Parliament,” he said.







“We demand that Khan sahib be given full access to doctors whom he trusts,” he said.
“I am told that Imran’s personal physician, Dr Asim Yusuf, is at Shifa Hospital, as are Dr Amir Awan and Dr Mazhar Ishaq; these are the two top specialists in Rawalpindi,” Abbas said.
“We can trust them, so we demand that he (Imran) be shifted immediately and provided the right treatment,” he added.
“He (Imran) was in the custody of the government, and his medical care and access to doctors were their responsibility,” he asserted.
TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that the opposition would present their demands at tomorrow’s sit-in.
“Our demand is just, and nobody will use abusive language or say hurtful things,” he vowed. “Only courteous and respectful language will be allowed.”
“Only God knows how long we will sit there, and we promise not to stand up,” Achakzai stated, inviting those who opposed injustice to join them.
In a post on X, he reiterated the same, saying, “A peaceful protest sit-in will begin outside the Parliament house from tomorrow.
“We will present our demands during tomorrow’s sit-in, and the sit-in will continue until the demands are accepted. If, God forbid, something goes wrong in accepting the demands, the government will be responsible,” he said.







‘State has committed a crime against Imran’
Earlier in the day, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC.
“A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended.
The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”.
Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court on Thursday that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig.







The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report.
Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”.
“Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged.
Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.”
The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment, including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad.
“The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.”
“This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision.
He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public.
“The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted.



Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran.
“So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.”
Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing.
Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”.
Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing.
He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”.
“He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said.
Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart.
“We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him.
“Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted.
Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them.
He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options.
The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health.
But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.”
“God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps.







Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”.
“It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated.
“When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment.
“This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed.
“We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said.
Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board
Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”.
In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”.
Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”.
“If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said.
Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society.
“Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended.
“This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted.
“If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned.
“The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted.







TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention.
“This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar.
He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “Nelson Mandela Rules” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture.
Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran.







‘Not a matter to be trivialised’
Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health.
“We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X.
“The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted.
The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”.
“This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated.
It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights.
The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement.
“Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.”







“When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded.
“Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”.
While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”.
The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”.
Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.”
The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran.

 

“A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged.
It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”.
In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder.
“These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended.
It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.”
The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated.
“You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.”
‘Inhumane treatment’
PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”.
“This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X.







PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them.
“PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X.
He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.”
Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”.
“The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said.







Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”.
“Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded.
“Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted.







Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”.
“The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.
