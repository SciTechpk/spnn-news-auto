The video’s thumbnail stated that an “Islamic army” was to take control of Gaza.
Indeed, one of the suggestions made by various countries to US President Donald Trump is to convince Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza and allow an international peacekeeping force to be stationed there. In fact, this suggestion is already part of the ‘peace plan’ that Trump is offering to Israel, the Palestinians and their respective allies. 
If all goes to plan and the hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, actually agrees, there is every likelihood that a peacekeeping force will replace the Israeli forces that have flattened Gaza and killed tens of thousands of men, women and children there — both Palestinian Muslims, as well as non-Muslims.
The peacekeeping force will most likely be made up of military personnel belonging to Muslim-majority countries. Therefore, it will be a Muslim force. Calling it an “Islamic army” is not only problematic but largely incorrect as well. Let me explain.

The constant interchangeable usage of the terms ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in public discourse has resulted in an inability amongst most to understand the important difference between the two

In Pakistan, the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in most cases are used interchangeably, or as if one were the synonym of the other. At least from the early 20th century, on political and social levels, the word ‘Islamic’ often carries clear ideological connotations, whereas the word ‘Muslim’ is almost entirely about cultural identity. 
So, in this context, not all Muslims are ‘Islamic’ as such. There are numerous men and women who identify with Islam due to their family background, heritage or the social environment in which they were raised. But they don’t adhere to or agree with the politics and practices associated with what is usually perceived as ‘Islamic’. 
They remain Muslim, though. However, they often view the word ‘Islamic’ as an outcome of mixing religion with politics. Some may be entirely secular and even dismissive of contemporary laws shaped by particular interpretations of the faith’s scriptures by certain governments, yet they identify themselves as Muslim and follow the basic doctrinal tenets and cultural practices of Islam.
So what is ‘Islamic’? Transmitting the Quran through art (calligraphy) is correctly understood as Islamic art. Architecture and design that are presented as visual representations of God’s infinite nature are also Islamic. A conference in which Muslim theologians discuss the dynamics of Islam’s scriptures can be termed as an ‘Islamic conference’ as well. But a conference that is framed to generate discussions about the political and economic standing of Muslim-majority countries is certainly not an ‘Islamic conference.’ It is a meeting of political representatives of Muslim-majority countries.
The confusion in this regard only deepened when political gatherings of Muslim leaders began to be labelled as ‘Islamic summits’ or when sports events involving athletes from Muslim-majority countries are labelled as ‘Islamic games.’ There is nothing ‘Islamic’ about them, unless the summits were discussing the complexities of Islamic theology or, in the latter’s case, sporting events were reshaped by putting them in the context of the sharia [Islamic teachings]. 
Returning to the case of Pakistan, the bulk of literature produced during the height of the Pakistan Movement in British India speaks about Muslim nationalism. For example, the All India Muslim League (AIML), which became India’s largest Muslim-interest party, treated the Muslims of the region as culturally distinct from India’s Hindu majority. 
Muslim nationalism even presented India’s Muslims as an overarching ethnic community within which lay different Muslim ethnic and sectarian/ sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the Hindu majority began to be viewed by AIML as an ethnic, cultural and political ‘other’.
Muslim nationalism encapsulated the ethnically diverse Muslims of India as a cultural whole but one with different ethnic, sectarian and sub-sectarian groups. Therefore, the AIML’s purpose was to create a Muslim-majority country with Muslim nationalism at its core. Had the AIML been leading an ‘Islamic’ movement, it would have struggled to address and regulate multiple interpretations of Islamic theology held by different sets of Islamic sects and sub-sects. In fact, according to the political scientist Muhammad Waseem, the concept of Islam in different ethnic groups among India’s Muslims too differed from each other on various theological points.  
This is when ‘Islamic nationalism’ entered the picture. Though slightly older than Muslim nationalism, Islamic nationalism’s purpose was to regenerate colonised Muslim societies through a revival of a global caliphate and universalised sharia laws, but it struggled to compete with the more regional, specific and ‘modernist’ Muslim nationalism. 
However, whereas Muslim nationalism succeeded in producing a separate Muslim-majority country in South Asia, it could not come to terms with the ethnic and sectarian fissures that intensified once the country was created, and the Hindu ‘other’ became a minuscule minority in the new country. 
So, starting from 1956, but more intently from 1973 onwards, an Islamic nationalism was introduced. This allowed the entry into the Constitution of various laws and rhetoric derived from a majoritarian interpretation of Islamic theology. From then onwards, everything began being termed as ‘Islamic’ — even though the Constitution still contained a large chunk of secular laws. 
 


According to the political scientist Ahmet T. Kuru, Islamic nationalism is a complex and often contradictory idea. It combines religious identity with nationalist aspirations. It is distinct from secular nationalism, which separates national identity from religion. Muslim nationalism lies somewhere between the two. It also combines religious identity with nationalist identity but keeps theology in the private sphere, to avoid theological complications between sects and sub-sects, and to mitigate any possibility of these complications mutating to give birth to a theocracy. 
But after 1973, the Pakistani state saw Islamic nationalism as a more robust tool to manage sectarian/ sub-sectarian and ethnic complexities. The term Muslim nationalism transcended to mean Islamic nationalism and then simply vanished. The question is: did Islamic nationalism resolve the complexities? No. It made them even more complex and, indeed, it did begin to mutate and give birth to a theocracy.
So far, this tendency has been mitigated by the state to settle for a volatile variant of ‘theo-democracy’ with an ‘Islamic constitution’ or, for that matter, ‘Islamic’ everything, even when much of this is anything but. 
So, to the journalist anticipating a peacekeeping force in Gaza made up of soldiers from various Muslim countries, it is an “Islamic army.” But the truth is, it will be just a Muslim army — unless its core purpose will be evangelical in nature and jihadist in intent, which will never be the case. 
One has to be extremely careful in how one uses the words ‘Islamic’ and ‘Muslim’ in the highly divisive and dangerously polarised world that we live in today.

The Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is emblematic of changing geostrategic dynamics and shifting alignments that are reshaping the regional landscape, and can contribute to the emergence of a new security architecture in the Middle East.
It has been forged in the backdrop of unprecedented volatility and violence in the region, with Israel’s two-year genocidal war having claimed over 65,000 Palestinian lives and wrought massive devastation and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
 
 

Israel’s attack on Qatar [on September 9] shook the entire region. It was the sixth country to face Israeli military aggression but the first Gulf state, and also a non-Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) ally of the US. This intensified growing doubts about the value and reliability of the American defence umbrella with the US unable or unwilling to restrain an unbound Israel.
 
 

The SMDA is a consequence of the eroding trust of regional states in an unpredictable US, whose blind support for Israel has heightened the security threat they face. Negotiations for the security agreement took place months before the strike on Qatar.
But the timing of its signing suggests the attack on Qatar and Israel’s unchecked aggression hastened its finalisation, with Riyadh seeking to diversify its security partnerships and Pakistan expanding its options. Under the deal, both countries would consider an attack on one as “an aggression against both.”
 
 

Details of the pact are not yet public, but it could shift the regional balance of power. It reflects a hedging strategy by Riyadh in turning to Pakistan for “joint deterrence against any aggression.” There has been much discussion about whether this has a nuclear dimension and involves extended deterrence. Pakistan has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity, to give itself flexibility. Saudi officials, however, are cited as saying, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”

Eos asked six foreign policy experts for their initial assessments of the recent Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) and Pakistan’s potential role in US President Donald Trump’s proposed plan for Gaza. Their analyses of these developments are presented below…

While the deal may bring Pakistan much-needed financial assistance to help its fragile economy, there are also real risks for Islamabad. The pact injects Pakistan into a volatile region and may involve commitments that may be difficult to fulfil if it is expected to become a net security provider to the region. These risks have to be mitigated if Pakistan is to avoid overextending itself, given its own internal and external security challenges.
Other risks and challenges may also emerge if Pakistan is asked by Washington to be part of a mostly Muslim multinational security force envisaged for Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan.’ Trump shared his Gaza proposals with Pakistan and seven other Muslim countries in a meeting in New York, but what was announced was different from what was agreed between them. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had intervened to change many elements of the plan.
The announced plan is vague and has no timeline on withdrawal. It has no guarantee of a complete Israel pullout from Gaza. It also doesn’t guarantee a permanent ceasefire. It says nothing about a Palestinian state or two-state solution and only talks vaguely about a pathway to statehood after the Palestinian Authority has carried out major reforms. It seeks to install a transitional authority headed by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. This has already provoked controversy and been likened to Iraqi-style direct occupation.
Without a deal between Israel and Hamas, the plan can’t take off. The plan has also been framed without consulting the Palestinians. It advantages Israel, which is why many Palestinians see it as a document of surrender. And it is why Netanyahu said at the joint press conference that Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established.
 
 

Despite the cautious welcome the plan has received from across the world, doubts are intensifying whether it will lead to an agreement, be implementable and usher in lasting peace. In view of these uncertainties and the plan’s fundamental flaws, Pakistan must exercise caution and not rush in to offer troops for the stabilisation force without being sure it doesn’t get dragged into Middle East turmoil, or become an unwitting accessory to Israeli occupation of Palestine.

The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland.

The timing of the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) is important, as it was signed in the context of escalating Israeli aggression, with the most recent attack on Qatar, the sixth Muslim-majority nation to fall victim to Israel’s targeted strikes. The US has failed to protect its Muslim allies in the Gulf, although it has military bases in the area — as also evidenced by the 2019 Saudi oil facility attack.
Pakistan’s ability to successfully defend itself and defeat Indian aggression in May 2025 has enhanced its regional image and military credibility. The agreement is a continuation of Pakistan’s history of providing security assistance, including the combat missions of Pakistan Air Force in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the security services provided during the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. 
The SMDA is of much significance as it is the first defence pact between two brotherly Muslim countries. Therefore, it is a “plus” for Pakistan’s key role in Middle East security. It sees Pakistan return to the Middle East as a net security provider after almost five decades. The formalisation of the SMDA can be attributed to primarily two decision-makers: Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This historic defence agreement recalls the close camaraderie between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia since the Lahore Islamic Summit of 1974, which Saudi Arabia and Pakistan jointly hosted. 
The agreement has been welcomed all over the Muslim world, Egypt and Iran included, as a demonstration of Islamic solidarity, with the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian crediting it as a “step towards a comprehensive regional security system with the cooperation of Muslim states.” The SMDA enhances inter-Muslim military collaboration and weakens the Indo-Israeli military axis. It demolishes the Biden-Modi strategy of the India-Israel-Middle East Corridor (IMEC), which Biden and Modi announced during the G20 summit in Delhi in September 2023, thus burying the IMEC under the debris of the Gaza genocide and, now, the sands of Arabia.
This agreement creates a new template of regional security, which combines the military power of Pakistan and the economic power of Saudi Arabia. It makes Pakistan a major Muslim middle power and its military capabilities and influence in diplomacy are now evident in the world’s most strategic region.
This agreement is a recognition of the respect and credibility of the Pakistan military’s professionalism and prowess, and capability to deliver, both for the homeland, as well as regional friends. It shows that, in the changing geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, with declining Western credibility in the aftermath of Israel’s Gaza genocide, regional countries are now looking at new strategic security options within the Muslim world. 
Pakistan is also a frontline candidate for any serious initiative for sending peacekeeping forces into Gaza, after a potential ceasefire, as a major Muslim country that is also a member of the UN Security Council and a key, longstanding contributor to UN peacekeeping missions through the past several decades.
But any country seeking a peacekeeping role in Gaza must meet the following criteria: 1) It should preferably be a non-Arab Muslim country; 2) It must enjoy credibility among Palestinians; and 3) It should have the confidence of the international community.

The signing of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) on September 17, 2025 is an unprecedented upgrade in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have always maintained cordial relations, including substantial defence and security cooperation dating back to the 1970s. Pursuant to a 1982 protocol, Pakistan’s forces have also engaged with the Saudis in training and advisory roles.
What distinguishes the SMDA from all previous cooperative endeavours is the provision that foreign aggression against one will be treated as aggression against both. This provides formidable strategic depth to Pakistan against possible aggression from India, and to Saudi Arabia against potential aggression from Israel. The agreement, thus, is a win-win for both countries and for the region.
Much of the details of the agreement are yet to be worked out. However, it appears that the agreement would be mainly operationalised in peace-time through sharing of intelligence and information, trainings and joint exercises, the exchange of expertise, boosting each other’s conventional defence capabilities, access to each other’s technological base, and possible cooperation in defence procurements and manufacturing. This multifaceted engagement would enhance the deterrence regime of both countries. Seen in this context, the SMDA can provide the much-needed stabilising effect for a region that has lately witnessed incessant violence and wars.
The concern that the agreement might pitch Pakistan against Israel and Saudi Arabia against India is not valid, as the agreement is essentially defensive in nature. Likewise, any apprehensions about Pakistani nuclear weapons being transferred to Saudi Arabia are totally misplaced, as the primary motive for Pakistan’s nuclear capability is to deter India’s aggressive designs against Pakistan.
The chatter of this agreement becoming a forebearer of a Muslim military bloc is also not realistic, given the diversity of the Muslim world. It is noteworthy that neither the US nor China have expressed any reservations on this agreement thus far. Iran has also welcomed the development, as it is likely to help bring in peace and stability to the region.
On September 29, 2025, President Donald Trump announced his 20-point plan to secure an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the past two years. The leadership of Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the UAE, as well as Israel and the Palestinian Authority, have welcomed the plan as it would help end the war in Gaza.
If a ceasefire comes into force, doors will open for unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to flow in and the reconstruction of Gaza. Israel has also committed to a phased withdrawal from Gaza. The plan does not envisage any role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza, which will be the responsibility of a technocratic, apolitical committee made up of Palestinians and international experts to be overseen by a ‘Board of Peace’ led by Trump himself.
It appears that, under the circumstances, the Trump peace plan is the best available option to prevent further bloodshed in Gaza. It meets a key demand of the Arab countries that the Palestinians would not be displaced from their lands and the West Bank would not be annexed. Israel would also have to give up its controversial intent to create a ‘Greater Israel’, at least for now.
However, it is not yet clear whether the US and Israel would recognise the state of Palestine. Unless that happens, there might not be any forward movement towards expanding the Abraham Accords, a stated goal of the Trump administration. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rightly remarked on X that the implementation of the two-state solution is “essential” to ensure lasting peace in the region.

Historically, Islamabad’s major partnerships, with the US, China and Saudi Arabia, began with security ties before economic or diplomatic links followed. That history came full circle when Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA). For Pakistan, this is a strategic leap. It reclaims the country’s earlier high-profile role in Middle Eastern security.
Early signs are promising — Qatar, Egypt and Turkey are already exploring similar agreements with Islamabad. For Saudi Arabia, the benefits are equally clear. It diversifies security partnerships, no longer relying solely on the US. This time, Riyadh’s partner is a nuclear-armed Pakistan with proven strategic capabilities.
Pakistan‘s comprehensive re-entry into the Middle East security zone is significant within the context of the changing global and regional environment — especially in the aftermath of the Middle East ‘peace plan’ proposed by US President Donald Trump. While there are questions about Pakistan contributing its forces to the international peacekeeping force given in the plan for Gaza, Pakistan is now finding a highchair for itself within the diplomatic realm at many important regional and international forums.
While what policy Pakistan finally formulates on what is an already controversial ‘peace plan’ will be important for its credibility within the Muslim world, Pakistan has a place amongst the states engaged with Trump on the proposed plan. Hard power is central to global politics, and Pakistan has emerged as both militarily formidable and diplomatically credible.
But the SMDA also raises pressing questions. One: will Pakistan provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella? Given Islamabad’s doctrine of ‘offensive defence’ and Israel’s repeated aggression, the answer is a likely yes. But for now, given strategic sensitivities, it is one that won’t get a clear answer from either party. Two: does this replace US-Saudi defence ties? No. It supplements them, giving Riyadh more options while retaining American backing. Three: could this be the seed of a regional military alliance with Pakistan at the core? Quite possibly. The region’s threat environment makes it more than likely.
Four: did Washington approve? Both Riyadh and Islamabad seem to have kept Washington, Tehran and Beijing informed. Five: What will be China’s role? While not yet formalised, it will be hard to ignore. With deep ties to both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and China’s cutting-edge defence technology, Beijing is well-positioned to become a partner in this evolving security arrangement.
As for the Gaza plan on the other hand, Palestinians, ceaselessly guillotined by Israel, are promised humanitarian aid and a battered semblance of statehood under the Trump plan. Crucially, this ‘state’ would not emerge under binding UN resolutions but only as Trump and Netanyahu dictate. The plan hands Israel veto power over every future step toward Palestinian statehood — rewarding Netanyahu while absolving him of responsibility for genocide and starvation.
Despite Palestinian courage and self-belief, the absence of strong allies — hesitant Arab states, distant Muslim friends and China’s calculated reticence — enabled this outcome. Fear and pragmatism on one side, and Israel’s bullying on the other, underwritten by Washington, ensured that no alternative plan survived. All other ceasefire efforts were bullied out of the fray.
Trump now brands his proposal an “eternal peace plan”, though, in reality, it reads as an eternal victory plan for Israel: entrenching Zionist ambitions, rejecting UN resolutions, disarming Hamas, legitimising indefinite Israel Defence Force (IDF) presence and staying silent on illegal settlements. It borders on a surrender document. Gaza itself is to be placed in the hands of Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair — the Iraq war criminal. Significantly, during the meeting with Trump in New York, Arab-Muslim leaders, though critical, could offer no alternative to Blair.
The tragic truth is that the Trump plan reflects raw US power calculus. It seeks to bury the Palestinians’ rightful struggle for their stolen homeland. Yet, the Palestinians’ heroic resistance in the face of the genocidal onslaught in Gaza proves that the Palestinian spirit will endure — long after the games of statist politics fade and long after their enemies imagine they have silenced it.

The latest 20-point Gaza plan is nothing more than a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. The Israeli genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and has devastated the entire enclave. Given Israel’s bellicosity, the prospect of any ceasefire deal remains remote. The Israeli prime minister’s speech at the UN General Assembly session shows no flexibility in Tel Aviv’s hard-line position.
Although Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, appears highly optimistic of a ceasefire deal, there is still no convergence of views over the long-term solution to the crisis that threatens the entire region. America’s plan for Palestine, which is said to be broadly supported by regional leaders, is similar to that of the plan for a Palestine state set out in the New York declaration endorsed by the UN general assembly a week earlier. It calls for an immediate ceasefire by Israeli forces, release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territory. It has also presented a plan for a future administration in Gaza, minus Hamas.
The US plan was apparently presented during the meeting between President Trump and leaders of eight Muslim and Arab countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th session, which envisages a two-state solution of the Palestinian crisis. The US plan was tacitly approved by the Muslim leaders, but it seems highly improbable that it will be implemented, as Israel has rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state and leaving its control over Gaza.
The development of an International Stabilisation Force (for maintaining law and order, and for providing support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza) to be deployed in Gaza would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump.
Soon after Trump’s statement that he would not allow Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank, an Israeli ultra-right cabinet minister declared that the process of annexation will not be stopped. Israel’s military actions against other Arab countries have made peace extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, the mutual defence treaty signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last month reflects the changing security dynamics in the Middle East, caused by Israel’s military escalation that threatens regional security. Not only has the Zionist state continued its genocidal war in Gaza, but it has also launched military strikes in half-a-dozen Arab countries. The most recent air strike was in Qatar, which houses the largest US military base in the regional countries.
Most Gulf and Arab countries have been depending on US security guarantees — America has 19 military bases in the region — but the unqualified support for Israeli aggression by the Trump administration has compelled these countries to think about an alternative defence arrangement. America’s refusal to condemn Israel for its unprovoked attack on one of the strongest US allies in the region has reinforced the sense of insecurity among these countries.
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have a long history of defence cooperation that goes back to the 1960s. Pakistan has some 20,000 troops already based in the Kingdom, for internal and external security. Pakistan has also been providing training to Saudi military officers. The latest pact has formalised the security cooperation. The details of the agreement are not available, but the most significant clause is that an attack on any of the two countries would be considered aggression against both. The pact has cemented the existing defence cooperation between the two countries. However, it’s too early to say that other Gulf countries will join this treaty.

The Pak-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) has no text that can be flyspecked and analysed. Most commentary has flowed from the joint statement, focusing on the qualifier “strategic” and the unambiguous declaration that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both [emphasis added].”
The commentary has elicited two types of responses: hyperbole and scepticism. Hyperbole about how significant it is and how it changes the rules of the game in the region and beyond (a Bloomberg analysis called it “the first concrete indication of what a post-American world might look like”) and scepticism over what it means and how much it encompasses.
I believe that the text might not be available anytime soon or, if and when it is made available, would contain only some general clauses. This is because the two sides could either want to keep certain specific provisions under wraps (I’ll just come to that) or use this more for the purpose of signalling and manipulating perceptions than identifying specific areas of cooperation.
Some comments have likened it to Article 5 of the Nato charter. This is convenient but lazy. Article 5 is not wedded to automaticity. Also, the line about mutual defence is cloaked in greater certitude than Nato’s collective defence clause. Once again, we don’t have the fine print, but it would be safe to say that there’s more assuredness here in words than there’s likely to be in action.
The term “strategic” combined with “joint deterrence” in the statement has brought into the picture “extended deterrence”, which is a technical term for a nuclear umbrella. This flies in the face of Pakistan’s traditional nuclear policy and needs to be clarified.
The timing is important, coming as it did eight days after the illegal Zionist strike at a house in Doha and two days after the extraordinary joint session between the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The strike showed the hollowness of United States security guarantees to its Gulf partners, at least if such a strike were conducted by the Zionist entity, and the lacklustre response by the extraordinary session to the idea of a multilateral security arrangement. Saudi analysts say that Riyadh decided to expedite the formalisation of the agreement for these two reasons.
While Riyadh has long sought external security guarantees, including from the US, the region has become more volatile and, at the very least, it would want to hedge its bets. From the US perspective, if such an agreement leads to burden-sharing and is not inimical to US interests, it might even be welcome.
This brings us to another development, which increasingly seems to have some connection to the SMDA: US President Donald Trump’s so-called Gaza Plan. Among other provisions of the plan, which is largely unworkable, is a peacekeeping force drawn from Arab/Muslim countries. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stated on X that it is in line with Pakistan’s official policy. He is wrong. My suspicion is that meetings at the White House were about Pakistan’s acceptance of this plan, which again seeks to prescind the Palestinians. Interestingly, in 2020, Sharif had tweeted to say that Palestinians were right to tear up the then Trump plan.
Pakistan’s endorsement of a plan rejected by Gazans lands us in a treacherous terrain that hasn’t been mapped out. One can go line by line to identify the perfidy built into the plan, but that is outside the scope of this brief. Corollary: the government must begin a debate in parliament on both the SMDA and the Trump plan, to rid the policy of its opacity and avoid leading the country into a morass. Or worse, by doing so, make Pakistan complicit in the US-Zionist genocide.

Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”.
The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan.
Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag.
“It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated.
Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived.
Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists.
 
 

Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”.
 






Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days.
“I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X.
A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday.
“We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians.
‘Zip-tied for five hours’
According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications.
They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted ’Free Palestine’,” Adalah said.

Hamas may have accepted some of the terms set forth for a ceasefire but uncertainty remains regarding further developments. US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has called for an end to the Israeli bombing — just days ahead of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement.
Rewind to a few days earlier when Trump announced the Gaza peace plan and said he’d agreed with eight leaders of the Muslim world. When he made public the details, murmurs of discontent started among some of these states that had agreed to the draft. The deceit was laid bare.
Qatar and Pakistan said more or less publicly that this wasn’t really what was agreed to. And that they were unhappy with what was announced. However, it was also leaked to the media that Qatar would continue to insist in private to the US that some sections of the original draft be restored, while lauding it in public. (All eight governments endorsed the deal in a joint statement.)
 
 

It then emerged that the agreed draft was ‘edited’, in effect mutilated, by Israel’s psychopathic prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during the six hours he spent ‘negotiating’ with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — both seen as personal friends of Netanyahu and the apartheid state, and both of whom have often backtracked on their positions to harmonise it with Israel’s.

Of the nearly 500 activists that set sail to deliver essential supplies to Gaza, only 30pc were Muslims.

These changes were made with the twin purpose of enabling Netanyahu to claim victory at home in order to appease his far-right coalition partners, namely Ben Gvir and Smotrich — both evil incarnate like himself.
At the same time, it was aimed at making it very difficult for Hamas to accept it because it excluded key Israeli Occupation Forces timelines for withdrawal, and dramatically cut the number of Palestinian hostages to be swapped for Israelis in Hamas captivity. It also excluded Palestinians from a top role in governance.
Bizarrely, the great and the good of the Muslim world — those with trillions of dollars in their sovereign wealth funds invested in the US; a Nato member boasting immense military power; another with a military powerful enough to have retaken territory lost to the apartheid state; and a nuclear-armed ummah state — were so helpless that three of them — Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye — were said to have put pressure on Hamas to accept the plan. That may have been why Hamas conditionally accepted it — or perhaps it had reasons of its own.
When the discontent among his key Gulf, Nato and newfound South Asian allies became apparent, it was leaked to the media that Trump was so unhappy with Netanyahu, as the negotiations proceeded, that he told him: “Take the deal or leave it. And if you leave it, we’ll walk away from you.”
Now, in the AIPAC-bought controlled political space in the US and the AIPAC-steered decision-making, if anyone wants you or me to believe for a moment that a US president, who has received hundreds of millions of dollars from supporters of the apartheid state had the leeway to ‘walk away’ from Israel, then you’d believe and so would I that this columnist is wealthier than Elon Musk.
This was one window to the world of lies we live in, and another is the one which tells us that Canada, France, Australia and the UK have ‘recognised the State of Palestine’. Their key Middle East ally Israel says there will never be a Palestinian state, so what they recognise is immaterial.
These democratic Western powers have time and again called for an end to the Gaza genocide and have, of late, taken to calling it abhorrent and unconscionable, but will not impose sanctions to force Israel to alter its conduct. For, that would mean putting their money where their mouth is and hurting the apartheid state.
 
 

These are the Western nations whose governments are still paying lip service to the Palestinian cause but whose people have taken to the streets in their millions to say enough is enough; they are calling for a boycott and blockade, of the apartheid state.
From the UK to Spain, from Belgium to Italy to Germany where police brutality, reminiscent of the SS of an era long gone is trying hard but failing to suppress the protest — it seems that all, from the Greens to the conservatives, have decided that the Palestinians have to atone for the sins of Nazi Germany, Holocaust being the worst. Almost as if to say one genocide has to pay for another.
Despite the fact that many governments in the Muslim world take unkindly to street protest, thousands of young Moroccans are out in the streets, battling the police to question their pro-Israel monarch’s polices. Turkiye has seen demonstrations too.
But then there is the other view. The humanitarian flotilla, with nearly 500 activists from around the world trying to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and deliver baby food, milk, diapers and women’s sanitary supplies and more, was intercepted by the apartheid state’s forces. Many of the activists were kidnapped by the Israeli Occupation Forces from beyond occupied Palestine’s territorial waters. Of these activists, a mere 30 per cent belong to Muslim countries. The rest belong to countries and societies and cultures that many among us in Muslim states feel so superior to. Tens of thousands are still pouring into the streets in Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Mexico City, Bogotá … the list is endless.
Many of us in the Muslim world are like our governments — docile and scared and unwilling to annoy the US — while many people in the much-derided West have taken to the streets, challenging their governments to do more. Here is hoping their humanity triumphs, for there lies hope.

It remains to be seen when and if the promises are fulfilled. Had the government made good progress on earlier demands, the region might have been spared the recent tumult.
In fact, the pattern so far shows that the government, in other parts of the country too, engages in negotiations with protesters merely to pacify the immediate situation, rather than look for permanent solutions to honour its commitments. In some cases, voices of protest fall on deaf ears.
For instance, just days before the JAAC protest, the families of Baloch missing persons once again ended their sit-in and returned from the federal capital. The peaceful families of the missing persons were not fortunate enough to receive even minimal attention from state institutions.
One must move beyond dealing with such situations through force, temporary negotiations and eventual disregard for the demands once ‘normalcy’ is restored. This modus operandi is a relic of colonial times. Many Commonwealth states inherited this pattern, but Pakistan is among the few that appear to have stuck to the old line, without distinction or reform. Regrettably, this is the approach the government took when the JAAC launched its protest this time and earlier in Azad Kashmir.
There have been many protest movements in the country, including the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, the Sindhu Bachao Tehreek, and the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. Their demand has been simple: constitutional, economic and political rights, and most importantly, the right to live with dignity. What is common to all such rights movements is that they are essentially anti-elite and challenge entrenched political and economic privileges. The state, however, responds with force against dissent.

The issue of elite capture has come to dominate rights struggles.

Protest can also be seen from a global perspective and applied locally. What took place in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal were anti-elite protests that were confronted by state repression. We have seen similar disaffection with elite privileges here as well, its most recent iteration being in AJK.
Yet the authorities in Pakistan, like those in India, have an advantage: the country’s ethnic, racial and religious diversity ensures that movements in the peripheries seldom capture the attention of the mainstream public discourse. The state tends to exploits this by ensuring that such movements remain disconnected from one another and do not reach the heartlands or urban centres where public opinion truly matters.
The recent incident at the National Press Club in Islamabad, where police brutally beat Kashmiri protesters, stormed the premises, and tortured journalists, is part of this same tactic: keeping rights movements, especially peripheral ones, away from the mainstream. The government and state elements not only deploys strong-armed measures but also manipulates narratives on both mainstream and social media. News is censored, and smear campaigns are launched against these movements, which are termed as foreign-funded conspiracies.
Half-page advertisements in the national media and TV screenings by the information ministry have recently been ‘warning’ that a new war is being fought in our minds. They are, in fact, a reflection of the state’s own mindset regarding justifiable dissent, which it reframes by overplaying the theory of hybrid warfare.
Dissenters are tagged as foreign agents and include NGOs, freelancers and media persons who ask critical questions. The public is warned not to share secret information with anyone. It is not certain what kind of sensitive information an ordinary citizen in the country can possess. However, the authorities insist it is a part of narrative warfare and try to create a barrier between areas where the protests take place and the rest of the country.
The recent protests can be seen as a continuation of a rights struggle that began several years ago. The protests were directly linked to promises the state made to the protesters in 2023, pledges that have remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the wealthy elite continue to thrive, aligned with power centres in the mainland. Ordinary people believe that privilege and fortune come only through corruption and collusion with these elites, a conviction that fuels their grievances.
The recent deadlock in talks between the government and JAAC, before resumption, centred on the issue of elite capture. Forced by the stalemate, the JAAC proceeded with its protest plan. At the core of JAAC’s 38-point charter was the elimination of elite privileges, especially the 13 reserved seats for Kashmiri refugees. The JAAC views these seats as a source of corruption and political manoeuvring, and thus playing a decisive part in forming governments in AJK.
The comparison with the (former) Fata seats in Pakistan’s parliament is evoked aptly to voice concerns regarding horse-trading and government-making and unmaking at Islamabad’s whim. The government counters that abolishing these seats would weaken Pakistan’s Kashmir case, as India also reserves seats for AJK and GB. It argues that removing them would signal acceptance of India’s Aug 5, 2019, abrogation of Kashmir’s special status.
The JAAC dismisses this claim. It insists that reserved seats have nothing to do with UN resolutions and do not affect Pakistan’s legal stance. Both AJK and GB want constitutional rights as citizens. Instead, critics assert, the state imposes taxes and removes subsidies but does not give them the constitutional cover that would allow citizens to benefit fully, without undermining UN resolutions.
Most of the JAAC’s demands were essentially municipal-level issues, including health, education and sanitation. Yet Pakistan’s ruling elites, particularly in the provinces, have destroyed the local government system, retaining revenues for themselves and spending like monarchs.

After nearly two years of relentless bombardment, the prospect of a truce — following Hamas’s conditional acceptance of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan, which includes releasing all hostages and handing Gaza’s administration to a technocratic Palestinian body, and Israel’s readiness to implement its first phase — offers a sliver of hope.
For a population living amid mass displacement, collapsed infrastructure, and the loss of over 66,000 lives, even a pause in the violence carries meaning. Yet history teaches that such truces often collapse under Israel’s obstinacy. If this opening is to amount to more than a tactical lull, it must be anchored in lasting commitments.
The Netanyahu government has already signalled it will calibrate operations rather than halt them outright. Reports from Gaza confirm bombardment continuing despite Mr Trump’s demand for Israel to “immediately stop bombing.”
 
 

Mr Trump has also set Hamas a deadline, warning that if it fails to accept the deal by Sunday night, “all hell” will break out. Such ultimatums underscore both the fragility of the moment and the dangers of coercion in a process that should prioritise justice and peace. Israel is notorious for backtracking once international attention drifts. This time must be different.
The guarantors of the truce — Washington, Arab capitals, and the UN — must ensure commitments are not quietly abandoned, and that violations invite consequences. Without sustained pressure, Tel Aviv has little incentive to comply beyond exchanging hostages for prisoners.
 
 

Accountability cannot be sacrificed for expedience. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 — figures the UN considers credible. That most of the dead are women and children underscores the monstrous scale of Israel’s actions. International law obliges states to investigate such crimes.
If there is no accountability for the massacre of tens of thousands, peace will rest on sand, and impunity will pave the way for repetition. Equally central is Gaza’s future. The blockade that has strangled the Strip for nearly two decades must be permanently lifted. Aid convoys cannot replace the right of Palestinians to move freely, rebuild homes, and recover their economy. Without freedom of movement, Gaza remains an open-air prison.
 
 

In the end, no ‘technocratic committee’ or transitional board will address the root cause. Only a two-state solution, long sabotaged by Israeli settlement expansion, can provide dignity and security. Yet Israel’s leadership has already said it does not accept Palestinian statehood, pledging to retain “security control” while denying Palestinians sovereignty.
Unless Palestinians are granted the means to build a viable state, violence will recur. This fragile pause may offer a chance. But unless it is built on accountability, freedom, and self-determination, it will remain just that — a pause before the next round of devastation.

• MP Iqbal Mohamed defends such marriages as culturally significant, urges genetic screening over bans
LONDON: Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has found itself at the centre of a political and cultural row after a government-backed education programme published — and then quietly removed — online guidance describing the potential benefits of first-cousin marriage.
UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the advice “shocking” and demanded an apology, saying first-cousin marriages are “high-risk and unsafe.” MP Iqbal Mohamed, however, defended such unions as culturally significant for many families.
Speaking in the Commons, he acknowledged health risks but said many families see such unions as positive for building bonds and financial security, urging genetic screening instead of a ban.
 
 

The document, published by NHS England’s Genomics Education Programme last week, stated that consanguineous unions can bring “stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages” even as it acknowledged the increased risk of certain genetic conditions among children of related parents.
Tory MP Richard Holden, who has proposed legislation to ban cousin marriages, condemned the document, calling on the NHS to “stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” Holden also linked cousin marriage to immigration and women’s rights, saying the practice “should be ended for good.”
By Monday September 29, the guidance appeared to have been taken down from the NHS website.
New YouGov research shows that three quarters of Britons (77 per cent) say first cousin marriage should not be legal, with only 9pc thinking the law should remain as it is. Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.
The study
The Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.
The document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.
It noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”
The guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.
It further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.
In February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.
The Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.
Professor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.
He said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”
But the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.
Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.
Prof Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.
BBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.

• India may release over 150,000 cusecs of water into Punjab rivers within 48 hours
• PDMA warns of potential flooding in some regions
• Survey of flood damage in 69 tehsils likely to be complete by 27th
LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre for compensation of crop losses, with the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) warning of potential flooding in some regions amid rain forecast for many districts and expected release of over 150,000 cusecs from India into the Chenab, Sutlej and Ravi rivers within a day or two.
While chairing a meeting in Multan to review the condition of cotton, rice, sugarcane and other standing crops, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said about 2,000 teams were conducting surveys of flood-related damages, though Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had already approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre to compensate for crop losses.
He said a comprehensive action plan had also been prepared to achieve wheat sowing target, noting that measures aimed at boosting cotton production had yielded encouraging results. So far, he said, 2.65 million bales equivalent of seed cotton (phutti) were picked this year as compared to 1.846m bales obtained during the same period last year according to Crop Reporting Service statistics.
 
 

Earlier, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an alert for rains in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan over the next 12 to 24 hours, specifically in the upper catchment areas of Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
On the other hand, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told a presser that the country was bracing for a shift in the weather, with rains expected over the next few days which may worsen the flood situation in Punjab.
Light to heavy rains are expected in various districts of Punjab from Rawalpindi to Lahore over the weekend, followed by showers on Monday in south Punjab. In the upper regions of Punjab, up to 100mm of rainfall was expected, he added.
Rising level of river waters
At Head Marala, Mr Kathia said, the Chenab River is carrying 20,000 cusecs, with an additional 100,000 cusecs expected from India in the next 48 hours. Marala’s current outflow is 23,000 cusecs. Considering that 900,000 cusecs water passed through Head Marala on Aug 26, he said it was not as big a challenge.
Besides, the Sutlej River may receive 50,000 cusecs from India, and 35,000 cusecs of water are expected to enter the Ravi River from the Thein Dam, he said.
On the other hand, Mangla Dam reported high water levels, though Jhelum may not face a massive flood situation.
Survey in 27 districts
The PDMA DG said a survey for flood damage assessment was underway in 27 districts of Punjab, with as many as 11,000 people being engaged in the exercise. A joint survey team includes officers from the Pakistan Army, district administration, and various other departments, he said, adding that a total of 2,213 teams were in the field.
With real-time monitoring through an online dashboard, survey is being conducted by the joint teams in 27 districts, he said. The exercise would be completed in 69 tehsils by Oct 27, he added.
 
 

Mr Kathia said the Bank of Punjab would establish counters in each tehsil to ensure provision of maximum facilities to flood victims. He said that flood survivors could receive Rs50,000 immediately after receiving cards.
Complaint resolution
For complaints related to the survey, he said, the PDMA in collaboration with Punjab’s IT Board had formed a platform, which would resolve complaints within seven days.
The DG recalled that there were over 350,000 flood victims in 2010, 38,196 in 2012, 359,000 in 2014 while a total of Rs14 billion was distributed among them.
Again in 2022, he said, 56,000 people affected by floods were provided a sum of Rs10 billion compensation.
He said that over the past 15 years, Rs51 billion was distributed among flood victims but the damage from the current flood was bigger than all previous floods.
Weather advisory
Meanwhile, NEOC issued the weather alert, warning that rains have been forecast for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad, Punjab and southern part of Sindh, with the possibility of landslides in mountainous areas.
In Punjab, Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Hafizabad, Sargodha, and Khushab may receive showers, while in Sindh, rain is likely in Karachi, Jamshoro, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Tharparkar, and Umerkot.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, intermittent rains are expected in Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, and Mansehra. Thunderstorms with rain are also likely in Peshawar, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Swabi, Hazara, Abbottabad, Mohmand, Bannu, Buner, Waziristan, and adjoining areas.
The NDMA said the NEOC was actively coordinating with relevant departments to ensure timely updates and effective emergency response. It urged people to avoid unnecessary travel in mountainous areas due to landslide risks, stay informed via radio, TV, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert app, and follow instructions of local authorities.

The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil.
According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.
“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.
The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.
 
 

They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.
“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.
Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.
On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.
The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.
Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.
FIR registered
Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.
Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.
According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.
 
 

Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.
Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.
“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.
Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.
The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.
Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.

The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues.
“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues.

Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today

“Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.”
However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters.
The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue).
Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her.
However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues.
As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”.
PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab.
“The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked.
PM’s Malaysia visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added.
A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

Global equities in Sept­ember climbed 3.4pc. An index of developed market sovereign bonds rose around 0.7pc last month.
The JPMorgan note, which tracks hedge fund trading, said positioning in US stocks was only  “somewhat bullish”, indicating an expectation for equities to rise.
Crowding in the biggest “Magnificent Sev­en” tech stocks, which include Apple, Amazon and Nvidia, remained near historical highs, the note said.
In Europe, stock-pickers tended to bet that equities would rise. But multi-strategy funds — those that trade many strategies — and quantitative funds, which use algorithms, tended to wager that stock prices would decline.
In Asia, where stocks rose, hedge funds had more bets on a decline than a rise, the note said.

• Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group
CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict.
According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby.
The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours.
Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”.
“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
 
 

Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal, including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian.
In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’.
Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan.
Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict.
Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties.
‘Immediate implementation’
Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage.
Dozens held in London
Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago.
Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent.
Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws.
Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews.
“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.”
 






Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes.
Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers.
“I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”
The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester.

However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities.
Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection.
As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India.
Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards.

Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks

Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand.
India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation.
Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification.
South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status.
These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements.
Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment.
 
 

In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement.
In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers.
In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment.
In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection.
In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited.
During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of
policy shifts.
In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually.
The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market.
Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30.
This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market.

A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi issued the order while hearing a petition filed by Advocate Munir Ahmed Kakar on Saturday. Advocate Kakar contended in his petition that despite the passage of considerable time, the Bostan Special Economic Zone had yet to be completed and made fully operational.
During the hearing, Saadullah, Chief Finance Officer of the Industrial Estate Development and Management Company of BSEZ, informed the court that the zone has already become partially operational.
He said that three factories were currently functioning in the zone, while 12 others were under completion and would soon begin operations.

CJ Barech designates two special appellate courts for inheritance cases in Quetta

He further informed the court that upon completion, these projects would create 15,520 jobs, marking the start of a new era of industrial development in Balochistan.
He further said that all necessary facilities, including water and power supply, were being ensured. 
The BHC bench, after hearing arguments from both sides, directed the authorities concerned to expedite the remaining work and make the Bostan Special Economic Zone fully operational by Dec 15 deadline.
Officials said that a large number of industrialists were ready to set up industries in the Bostan Special Economic Zone once it became fully functional.
Appellate courts
Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech has also taken an important administrative step to ensure the effective, timely, and transparent hearing of inheritance cases by designating two special appellate courts in Quetta.
According to an official notification, under the directive of the Chief Justice, the courts of Additional District and Sessions Judge-VIII, Quetta, and Additional District and Sessions Judge-X, Quetta, have been assigned to exclusively hear and decide inheritance-related cases.
As per the decision, all pending inheritance cases previously under other Additional District and Sessions Judges in Quetta will now be transferred to these two designated courts.

Despite a mild appreciation of the rupee against the US dollar, uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate continues to prompt exporters to lock in future rates, as they fear potential volatility once current controls are eased.
Dealers in the inter-bank market said the exchange rate could shift if exchange rate management is relaxed. The prospect of International Monetary Fund (IMF) scrutiny over currency controls also adds to market concerns.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reports daily gains in the rupee’s value against the dollar, typically in the range of one to three paisas. However, currency dealers noted a sharp drop — between 50 to 60pc — in cash dollar sales by exchange companies.

Open market greenback inflows fall sharply

Some major open-market dealers said that dollar inflows have nearly dried up. Overseas Pakistanis, who previously sold dollars in the open market, are now holding back — a trend dealers describe as new and concerning. One dealer speculated that dollars intended for the open market may be diverted to informal channels.
 
 

Authorities remain vigilant. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the government have maintained strict oversight to prevent illegal currency activity. Dealers said sales of dollars by exchange companies to banks have also declined sharply, while inflows through authorised money changers are down. However, remittance inflows via formal banking channels have remained stable compared to the same period in FY25.
Bankers stated that the decline in dollar sales in the open market is not linked to changes in government incentives for banks and exchange companies. Official data shows no decrease in remittances during July and August.
While the government has made efforts to lower the exchange rate, it has not achieved the desired results. Following crackdowns earlier in the current fiscal year, the dollar has weakened against the rupee in both the inter-bank and open markets.
Currency stability has been supported by the SBP’s higher foreign exchange reserves, steady remittance inflows, and improved diplomatic relations with the United States and China.
However, exporters’ growing use of forward contracts suggests ongoing concerns about exchange rate management.
The SBP has maintained market liquidity rather than suppressing it to lower the rupee-dollar rate artificially.
Dealers said the central bank has slowed its dollar purchases from the inter-bank market to avoid putting pressure on the exchange rate. Still, the risk of renewed central bank buying remains a factor prompting exporters to hedge in the forward market.

He said Balochistan’s identity is built on mutual respect and traditions that uphold justice, and  values of honour, courage, and hospitality.
 
 

IG Tahir said that the people have rendered great sacrifices for peace, and the history written by the martyrs through their sacrifices is commendable. “The forces we are confronting may have deep roots, but we are determined to uproot them completely,” he added.
He emphasised that Balochistan is a bouquet of diversity, and its beauty lies in upholding the rule of law. “It is essential to distinguish between criminals and ordinary citizens, as in this age, the real strength lies with the people,” he stated.

Unlike commodity exports, services exports have recorded positive growth since the beginning of FY26. In July, services exports rose by 18.27pc year-on-year.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the growth was primarily driven by telecommunication, computer, and information services in July FY26.
In August, services exports reached $671.98 million, up from $619.94m in the same month last year. However, on a month-on-month basis, services exports declined by 7.30pc.

Trade deficit widened amid rising imports in 2MFY26

In rupee terms, exports increased by 9.85pc to Rs189.662 billion in August FY26, compared to Rs172.651bn in August FY25. This indicates a steady upward trend in services exports during the current fiscal year.
During the first two months (July-August) of FY26, services exports totalled $1.396bn, showing an increase of 11.73pc from $1.250bn in the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s services exports grew by 9.23pc to $8.39bn from $7.68bn a year earlier.
The services sector has shown consistent growth since February 2024, largely due to a surge in IT and other business services exports. However, there was a 6.50pc decline in August 2024.
According to State Bank of Pakistan data, exports of telecommunications, computer, and information services rose to $691m in July—August FY26 from $584m in the same period last year, reflecting a growth of 18.32pc.
Exports of other business services increased by 16.66pc to $301m in 2MFY26, compared to $258m last year. However, transport services exports fell by 4.62pc to $124m from $130m.
Travel services exports declined sharply by 18.91pc to $90m in July–August FY26, compared to $111m in the corresponding period last year.
On the import side, services imports surged by 13.36pc to $1.108bn in August FY26, compared to $978.19m a year ago. Month-on-month, imports rose by 11.43pc.
In the first two months of FY26, services imports reached $2.104bn, up 13.43pc from $1.855bn during the same period last year.
Transport services imports declined by 7.03pc to $766m in 2MFY26, down from $824m last year. In contrast, travel services imports more than doubled, reaching $735m in 2MFY26 from $361m — a growth of 103.6pc.
As a result, the services trade deficit widened by 16.94pc to $707.23m in 2MFY26, compared to $604.79m in the same period last year.

KHUNJERAB Top sees season’s first snowfall, blanketing area near Pakistan-China Gate.—Courtesy GB tourist police

GILGIT: The upper areas of Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday received the first snowfall of the season, which is seen as a positive sign after years of delayed snowfall linked to climate change that has disrupted the fragile ecosystem and worried local communities.
The lower areas rec­eived scattered rain on Friday and Saturday, bringing a noticeable drop in temperature. According to locals, the areas situated above 12,000 feet, including Khunjerab Top and Babusar Top, received the first snowfall of the season. The snow-covered landscape pushed temperatures below freezing.
 
 

Tourist police said traffic at Babusar Top had been closed at night due to fears of slippery conditions. The Babusar Road, which usually remains open from June to November, is a key route for tourists and local passengers travelling between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country.
Similarly, the Khunjerab Top area also received up to three inches of snowfall, disrupting travel for vehicles moving between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass. Many areas of Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Diamer, Astore and Baltistan divisions received scattered rain, forcing residents to wear warm clothes and make heating arrangements at homes.
 
 

Gilgit-Baltistan experienced devastating floods this summer caused by rapid glacier melt, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), cloudbursts, and landslides. Over 50 people, including tourists, lost their lives, while infrastructure, agricultural land, forests, and private properties worth billions of rupees were destroyed.
In July, temperatures in Chilas soared to 48.5°C — the highest since July 17, 1997, when it reached 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature hit 46.1°C, the highest since 1971. Experts believe that the region, one of the most environmentally sensitive in the world, has been experiencing severe climate change impacts in recent decades. Over the past decade, snowfall in GB has been delayed until late December or even March.
Experts warn that this shift in weather patterns prevents snow from compacting into stable ice, and with the onset of heatwaves, unstable snow melts rapidly, triggering flash floods and Glof events.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that climate change has severely affected the fragile ecosystem of GB, home to over 8,000 glaciers, 30,000 glacial lakes, countless mountains, and vast pastures.
He said unplanned development, rapid tourism, and construction in forested and green-belt areas are damaging the region’s environment. He stressed GB’s vulnerability to climate change and its crucial role as Pakistan’s “water tower,” feeding the Indus River, which supports 70 per cent of the country’s agriculture and 40pc of its hydropower.

According to a notification issued by the cabinet division, Mr Sadiq will perform the functions of the acting president under Article 49(2) of the Cons­titution. He will continue to discharge these responsibilities until the president and Senate chairman return to the country.
After taking charge, Mr Sadiq welcomed the successful negotiations between the government’s negotiation committee and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee in AJK.
He described the agreement between the two sides as a positive and constructive development, stressing that the restoration of peace and normalcy in the region was a matter of great satisfaction.
Mr Sadiq said that with the successful negotiations, all baseless rumours and conspiracies against Pakis­tan had been laid to rest.
He commended both the government’s negotiation team and the committee for their responsible and result-oriented approach.
The acting president reiterated that public welfare and peace remain the government’s top priority. He urged all stakeholders to focus on unity and national development rat­her than giving attention to unfounded rumours.
“Pakistan and Kashmir are inseparable. The protection of the rights of the Kashmiri people will always remain our foremost priority,” he added.

The index gained 6,733 points or 4.15pc on a weekly basis to settle at 168,990, according to data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd. The rally was primarily driven by continued buying by mutual funds and individual invest­ors, supported by limited returns on fixed-income instruments and optim­i­­sm around ­mac­roeconomic indicators.
The IMF, while acknowledging progress in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, highlighted persistent vulnerabilities in the external account. The Fund emphasised the need for sustained reforms amid high inflation and external debt challenges. Markets remain closely attuned to the review’s outcome, which is critical for the release of the next $1.2bn tranche.
Investor sentiment was further buoyed by a high-profile meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US President Donald Trump in Washington, interpreted by analysts as a signal of improving international engagement. AKD Securities noted that despite a 19.8pc drop in market participation, confidence remained intact, with average daily volume reaching 1.8bn shares and value at Rs72bn.

KSE-100 index rises over 6,700 points to 168,990 in a week

On the macroeconomic front, inflation rose to 5.6pc year-on-year in Sep­tember, up from 3pc in August — the highest level in 10 months. Ana­l­y­sts attributed the rise partly to post-flood effects and supply-side pressures.
In the government’s latest T-bill auction, yields increased across all tenors — one-month (up 41bps), three-month (20bps), six-month (21bps), and 12-month (19bps). The State Bank raised Rs730.4bn against a target of Rs750bn, with total participation at Rs1.49tr, indicating robust demand amid expectations of a stable policy rate in the near term.
Pakistan’s trade deficit widened to $3.3bn in September, up 46pc year-on-year and 16pc month-on-month. This took the 1QFY26 trade gap to $9.4bn — a 33pc increase from the same period last year. September exports stood at $2.5bn, down 11.7pc year-on-year, while imports rose to $5.8bn, up 14pc.
Foreign exchange reserves rose slightly to $19.80bn, including SBP-held reserves of $14.40bn, with the rupee appreciating marginally by 0.03pc to close the week at Rs281.37 against the dollar.
Sector-wise, cement dispatches totalled 4.25m tonnes in September, up 7.05pc year-on-year, driven by a 14pc rise in domestic demand. First-quarter FY26 dispatches reached 12.16m tonnes, up 16.3pc from 10.46m tonnes in the same period last year.
Petroleum sales rose 8pc year-on-year in September to 1.37m tonnes, led by higher demand for petrol and high-speed diesel. However, furnace oil volumes declined due to a reduction in power generation usage. Total petroleum sales in 1QFY26 rose 6pc to 3.89m tonnes.
In the fertiliser segment, urea sales rose 17pc year-on-year to 429,000 tonnes in September, while DAP sales fell 47pc to 71,000 tonnes, reflecting weak farm economics and lower imports.
The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.5x for 2026, slightly below its 15-year average of 8.59x. Dividend yields remain attractive at around 6pc, close to the long-term average.
Brokerages expect the upward momentum to continue if the IMF review concludes smoothly and global credit agencies maintain their improved outlook on Pakistan. Limited alternative investment avenues and attractive equity valuations are likely to keep investor interest intact in the near term.
Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-05 02:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0510251864fb375.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946655/pakistan-india-meet-again-this-time-at-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India meet again, this time at Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>COLOMBO: It’s the fourth consecutive Sunday of a Pakistan-India cricket encounter; the only difference being that the hot and arid climate of Dubai has been replaced with the humid and rainy weather of Colombo, and of course, the gender of the players on the field.
However, the differences are starker once a person starts to peel back the surface of the women’s game in both countries. 
On one hand, we have players from across the border who have opportunities like the Women’s Premier League available, where compensation reaches upwards of $400,000 for the highest-paid players.
On the other hand, barring a few players in the national side and those who make it to final rosters of a handful of cricket leagues worldwide — Pakistani domestic women cricketers’ monthly retainers were even less than the government-mandated minimum wage this year.
To say that the gulf in resources available to both teams is large would be an understatement of the century.
Furthermore, in yet another familiar scenario at the start of an ICC tournament, the Indian team is going into the encounter with a win against co-hosts Sri Lanka while Pakistan have lost to Bangladesh in their opening encounter — a side they had beaten with ease in the Qualifiers in April.
However, the Pakistan skipper was at her usual jovial best at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, seemingly putting last match’s result behind her.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in men’s Asia Cup encounters from last month, she made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
“Obviously, our main goal is to play, and when we come here, our focus is only on the game … whatever comes in the spirit of the game, we try to maintain that,” Fatima said.
She also touched upon moments of camaraderie between the two sides, like the last World Cup encounter in New Zealand, where Indian players had playfully interacted with Bismah Maroof’s newborn baby, Fatima.
The Indian skipper, Kaur, however, could not give her take as the Indian management chose to send the bowling coach Aavishkar Salvi to the pre-match presser.
When asked about the bitterness from the men’s encounters disrupting the relationships of the players here as well, Salvi never got the chance to answer as the question was deemed too political for the presser.
Pakistan’s chances of making it to the next stage might have been further hampered by Saturday’s result in Colombo — where a rained-out fixture meant both Sri Lanka and Australia shared a point each.
This would make Fatima’s aim of finishing in the top four more difficult, as the extra point that Sri Lanka got in this match could be the difference between making the cut or not.
The square, which has remained under the covers throughout the day with rain pouring down means both sides’ pacers will be rearing to go early in the innings.
Bowlers to look out for would be Pakistan’s Diana Baig, who goes into the encounter with decent bowling rhythm, and Indian off-spinner Sneh Rana who is the second-highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year.
“Everyone knows that she’s one of our best players. She’s a good bowler and also a very good fielder. So it definitely boosts our team as well,” Fatima said of Diana’s encouraging performance in the opening encounter.
Echoing her remarks after the Bangladesh loss, Fatima said the toss or conditions would not be that important as the pitch remained the same for both sides throughout.
“The pitch doesn’t matter much; all we have to do is play good cricket after assessing the conditions.”
With rain predicted for Sunday as well, there is a glimmer of hope for the Green Shirts as a washed-out encounter or one curtailed by the downpour could tip the odds in their favour. 
Their record against India across 11 One-day Internationals is an unenviable one — never once winning a tie, but across T20Is, there is still a better record to boast about.
The women’s side have beaten India on three occasions in the format — with their first win in a World Cup coming back in 2012 — nine years before the men’s side achieved that feat.
Speaking about the ODI record, the Pakistani skipper said: “Records are meant to be broken, we won’t go on past histories, but will take the match on the day and try to execute our plans.”
Fatima and co. would have to channel their best in the field to add another win to that tally — and maybe the rain clouds in the Sri Lankan capital might have a silver lining for the Women in Green.

Haripur Sub-Inspector (SI) Basit Ashraf said in a statement that the suspects were part of a gang who allegedly raped a minor boy at gunpoint and filmed the assault, using the footage as blackmail.
“The NCCIA carried out an operation in Abbottabad,” he was quoted as saying. “The NCCIA registered a case against nine suspects … they assaulted the victim multiple times and blackmailed him and his family with the videos.”
SI Ashraf said that the suspects allegedly shared the videos on WhatsApp and used them to blackmail the victim’s family.
“Mobile phones and pornographic videos were recovered from the suspects during the raids,” he stated, adding that they would be used as evidence.
In July, Haripur police arrested a seminary teacher for allegedly sexually abusing a visually-impaired five-year-old child in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur area, police said.
A first information report (FIR) was filed by the victim’s uncle at Saddar police station on July 10 under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (rape) and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act (CPA).
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p><small>2025-10-04 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626973-rain-likely-in-karachi-within-next-24-hours-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to receive rain in next 24 hours: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday.
“The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read.
 






According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad.
“Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution,“ Mazlan said at an event in Karachi.</p><small>2025-10-04 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626968-pia-set-to-launch-nonstop-flights-to-uks-manchester-from-oct-25' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to resume nonstop Islamabad–Manchester flights from Oct 25</strong></a><br><p>

“The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides.
Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira.
The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”.
Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.”
Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”.
A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”.
A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout.
In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.”
 
 

“This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”.
Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required.
“Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days.
 






Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.
 
 

From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry.
Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC.
On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz
Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”.
Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added.
 






PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”.
He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal
Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.”
He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”.
 






Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”.
He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”.
“The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.</p><small>2025-10-04 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626969-indian-forces-kill-injure-goats-near-zero-point-in-tharparkar' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces kill, injure goats near Zero Point in Tharparkar</strong></a><br><p>

The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
In a statement issued today, the PPP leader said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”.
The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims.
 






The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader.
“Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.”
He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances.
Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum.
He said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue.
“Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River.
“Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.”
He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.”
Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”.
“Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.”
“If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said.
US commits $1m to Unicef flood response
Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan.
Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution.
It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers.
Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits.
“Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases. This timely support from the United States enables us to deliver life-saving services and help restore dignity and hope to families who have suffered loss and displacement, as they begin the difficult journey of recovery,” the press release quoted Pernille Ironside, Unicef representative in Pakistan, as saying.</p><small>2025-10-04 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/042007074f4be59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946566/new-normal-of-response-army-warns-future-pak-india-conflict-might-lead-to-cataclysmic-devastation' target='_blank'><strong>‘New normal of response’: Army warns future Pak-India conflict might lead to ‘cataclysmic devastation’</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.”
 






Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory.
“As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.”
It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression.
The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
“For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.”
The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”.
“Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines.

This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval, but no exact date was given.
PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.”
 






In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit.
In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04174114b7e118e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946557/islamabad-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-imran-riaz-khan-kp-anti-graft-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court issues arrest warrants for Imran Riaz Khan, KP anti-graft officials</strong></a><br><p>A district and sessions court in Islamabad issued bailable arrest warrants for YouTuber Imran Riaz Khan and two officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s anti-corruption body, it emerged on Saturday.
The arrest warrants, issued by Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah yesterday and available with Dawn.com, were issued for Khan, head of the Directorate of Anti-Corruption Sadeeq Anjam and Adviser to the KP Chief Minister on Anti-Corruption Musaddiq Abbasi, over their alleged involvement in a social media campaign against Islamabad Judge Humayun Dilawar.
Dilawar was the judge who convicted PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case in 2023 and sentenced him to three years in prison.
All three warrants were issued under Sections 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 and Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) and 506ii (punishment for criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
There was no date given by which the three men needed to be produced before the court.
A day prior, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) dismissed a petition seeking to quash a cybercrime case registered against a petitioner accused of running the campaign.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, in a detailed judgement, ruled that the first information report (FIR) could not be quashed at this stage since a challan had already been submitted to the trial court. He further observed that partially quashing an FIR to the extent of one suspect, while others remained nominated, was a legal impossibility.
Last September, a judicial magistrate in KP’s Bannu issued arrest warrants for Judge Dilawar at the request of the Anti-Corruption Establishment, who were probing the Islamabad magistrate’s family’s alleged involvement in a graft case.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04164838ba5e5e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946552/interior-minister-lauds-security-forces-for-eliminating-over-14-terrorists-in-balochistans-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister lauds security forces for eliminating over 14 terrorists in Balochistan’s Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday lauded the security forces for eliminating more than 14 terrorists in Khuzdar district.
Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20.
 






In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”.
He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.”
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!”
 






Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan.
A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district.
On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-10-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626920-14-indian-proxy-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-khuzdar-sources' target='_blank'><strong>14 Indian proxy terrorists killed in Balochistan's Khuzdar operation: sources</strong></a><br><p>
