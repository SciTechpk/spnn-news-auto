The US-Israeli hostilities against Iran have subsided.
It appeared that a larger clash was brewing when Iran hit a major US airbase in Qatar on Monday night in retaliation against America’s bombing of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities on Sunday.
But this turned out to be a largely symbolic and telegraphed attack, as only a few hours after the Iranian salvo, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had taken effect. Doubts about the truce dissipated when both Iran and Israel confirmed that the ceasefire had taken effect on Tuesday.
 
 

However, the fragility of this arrangement was clear to all as Israel claimed Iran had violated the truce, and threatened to hit Tehran. The Iranians denied the violation, and claimed their attacks had been launched before the truce took effect. Later in the day, Mr Trump would return to social media to tell the world that the ceasefire was intact, while asking Israel to “not drop those bombs”. Despite the strong warning, Israel went on to strike Iran after the ceasefire.
While the cessation of attacks is indeed welcome, questions swirl about how long — hours, days, weeks? — this truce will last. The main reason for this scepticism is that Israel has proved to be a belligerent, destabilising state that scuttles its commitments on the flimsiest pretext. It is also a fact that Mr Trump’s mood and policy decisions change frequently, though his latest comments indicate that his appetite for war with Iran has reduced considerably. Iran has said it will respond to truce violations, but the ‘measured’ response targeting the US base in Qatar shows that the Islamic Republic, too, is uninterested in escalation.
Now, it is up to America to rein in Israel if Mr Trump is serious about winding down this conflict. Angry social media posts will not make Tel Aviv come to its senses. The US needs to stop its flow of funds and arms to Israel if it really wants lasting, substantive peace in the Middle East.
Over 600 Iranians, including civilians, have been killed in the Israeli aggression. Assuming this is not a tactical move on the part of the US and Israel, all efforts must be made to make the ceasefire hold and prevent a further flare-up in the region. Moreover, Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza must also be brought to a halt.
While attacking Iran, Israeli forces have continued their murderous assault on the occupied Palestinian territory, with the result that over 56,000 people have been slaughtered in the Strip since Oct 7, 2023. Israel must immediately cease its criminal actions both in regional countries, as well as the occupied territories.

A two-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa announced a short order, which had been reserved the previous day, on the former prime minister’s bail petitions. The bench will issue a detailed verdict later.
The other cases involve attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty, PML-N offices in Model Town, Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge.
On Nov 27 last year, an anti-terrorism court had denied bail to the former PM in these eight cases.
The bail petitions, filed through Barrister Salman Safdar, argued that the prosecution had failed to establish any connection between the petitioner and the incidents mentioned in the FIRs.

Prosecution claims PTI founder instructed party leaders, workers to attack military installations

They claimed that Imran Khan had been implicated in the May 9 cases as part of a well-orchestrated plan aimed at harassing and humiliating him for political reasons, despite the fact that he was in NAB custody at the time.
The petitions further stated that the only allegation against the petitioner was of “abetment,” which the prosecution had presented in vague terms. It was also argued that the trial court overlooked the fact that similar allegations had already been dismissed due to inconsistencies in the investigating agency’s narrative.
The petitions requested the LHC to overturn the trial court’s decision and grant bail to the former premier in all eight FIRs.
Opposing the bail, the prosecution told the court that the PTI founding chairman had instructed party leaders and workers to attack military installations.
It said an audio recording allegedly of the PTI founder had been forensically examined and was to be matched with his voice. However, the accused had refused to undergo a voice-matching test.
The prosecution maintained that the Jinnah House attack case was distinct from the others as Imran Khan had been specifically nominated in the FIR. It added that substantial evidence existed against him, making him ineligible for bail.

• Questions linger over terms of ceasefire, future of Tehran’s nuclear ambitions
DOHA / WASHINGTON: Iran’s ‘strike’ on the US military base in Qatar was carefully calculated to provide an exit from hostilities with Washington and set up a truce with Israel, according to analysts and officials with knowledge of the matter.
The missile launches were signalled well in advance, minimising the risk of injury and giving every opportunity to shoot down the projectiles — resulting in a fireworks display of booms and flashes above Doha.
They followed heavy US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at the weekend, a sudden escalation that raised concerns about how Tehran would respond after more than a week of exchanges with Israel.
It would seem that Qatar, located across the Persian Gulf, held the answer in the form of Al Udeid, the Middle East’s biggest US base and headquarters of its regional command.
Targeting a US base, rather than inciting fury, triggered a calm reaction from President Donald Trump, who thanked Iran for giving “early notice”.
Qatar condemned the strikes — Iran’s first on a Gulf country’s territory — but its prime minister said the response would be diplomatic and legal, rather than military.
Then, hours after the attack, Trump announced a ceasefire that both Israel and Iran later said they would accept.
A source with knowledge of the talks said Doha had spoken to Tehran and “persuaded” it to stop fighting.
Trump spoke directly to Netanyahu, and Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were involved in the direct and indirect communications with Iran, the official said.
But it was Qatar that helped broker contacts with Tehran. According to a source with knowledge of the talks, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani spoke to the Iranians at Washington’s request after the strikes.
Trump told Qatar’s emir that Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, before US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the prime minister “who persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians”, the source said.
Will it last?
A long list of big unanswered questions remains, not least whether any ceasefire can actually hold between two bitter foes, whose years-long rivalry turned into an air war when Israel launches strikes against Iran. This fierce fighting marked the past 12 days of strikes on each other’s territory.
The concerns were underscored on Tuesday as Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating the fragile truce within hours after it was due to take effect.
Questions also remain about what has actually been agreed to, even as Trump’s declaration raised hopes for the end of a conflict that has prompted fears of a broader regional war.
For example, will the US and Iran revive failed nuclear talks; what will be the fate of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium, which many experts believe may have survived the US and Israeli bombing campaign.
Signalling a difficult path ahead, it took hours for Israel and Iran to even acknowledge that they had accepted the ceasefire that Trump said he had brokered.
“Now that Trump has declared ‘world peace’, it will be hard for Netanyahu to publicly contradict him,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a Middle East expert at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington.
“Can the ceasefire hold?” asked Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic administrations. “Yes, the Iranians need it and the Israelis have largely now acted against the [Israeli Defence Force’s] target list.”
‘Calibrated response’
Trump administration officials deemed Iran’s response to have been calibrated to avoid further escalation with the US, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Ali Vaez, senior advisor at the International Crisis Group said said the “good relationship between Iran and Qatar is the reason that Iran opted to strike… the Al Udeid base in Qatar”.
“I see this as a continuation of Qatar’s mediation between Iran and the United States, that it has taken this punch as a means of trying to prevent further escalation,” Vaez added.
Wealthy Gulf states in Iran’s immediate neighbourhood, which host a number of US military sites, had been preparing for days for a possible strike.
Last week, dozens of US military aircraft disappeared from the tarmac at Al Udeid, according to satellite images published by Planet Labs PBC and analysed by AFP.
In the hours before the attack, the US embassy in Qatar advised Americans there not to go out, with some other Western embassies echoing the warning.
Shortly before the strikes, air traffic was suspended over Qatar “as part of a set of precautionary measures”, the country’s foreign ministry said.
Chatham House geopolitics specialist Neil Quilliam said the attack was “clearly limited” and “intended to satisfy Iran’s population that its leadership responded forcibly to the US air strikes on Saturday”.
“The Israelis have accomplished much of their objectives … and Iran was looking for an off-ramp, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy US national intelligence officer for the Middle East.
“The US hopes this is the beginning of the end. The challenge is whether there is a strategy for what comes next.”

The KSE-100 index climbed by 6079.16 points, or 5.23 per cent, to close at 122,246.63 points.
Earlier in the day, shares at the PSX had climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened. It reached an earlier intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday, before a market halt was initiated.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to the overnight announcement of a ceasefire, with broad-based gains across sectors.
Farooq said, “The Pakistan market rallied earlier today following the overnight announcement of a ceasefire.
“However, reports during the day of Israeli claims that Iran has violated the ceasefire dampened sentiment, pulling the market down from an intraday high of 122,045.62 to 121,926.63 currently. Despite the pullback, local fundamentals remain intact, and the rally could resume if the ceasefire holds. Geopolitical developments will continue to drive market direction in the near term.
Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, Reuters reported.
At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.
The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.
Farooq explained, “If the KSE-30 Index moves ±5pc from the previous day’s close and remains at that level for five consecutive minutes, trading is stopped for 60 minutes.”
He added that this mechanism kicks into action whether the index rises by 5pc or falls by that margin to help cool the market down.
The PSX had endured a sharp sell-off on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.
The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the “dual existential threat” of Tehran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would “respond forcefully” to any Iranian violation of the truce.
Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.
The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.
According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.
After Trump’s announcement, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that “as of now, there is no ‘agreement’ on ceasefire or cessation of military operations”.
However, he added that if Israel stopped “its illegal aggression”, Tehran would have “no intention to continue our response afterwards”.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Hours after a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, brokered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Tues­day reiterated Paki­stan’s unwavering support for Iran at all diplomatic for­ums, including the United Nations.
Welcoming the ceasefire, the Foreign Office also pledged to support all efforts to bring peace and stability in the region, in line with the principles of the UN Charter.

The two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among the Ummah during this most challenging time and agreed to remain in touch.
Meetings with envoys
Earlier, the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia and Qatar called on PM Shehbaz on Tuesday and discussed the Middle East situation, particularly after the Iranian attack on the US military base in Qatar.
During the meeting with Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Pakistan, Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, the prime minister assured that Pakistan would continue to work closely with Saudi Arabia for peace in the region through dialogue and diplomacy.
In the meeting with Ambassador of Qatar Ali Mubarak Ali Essa Al-Khater, the prime minister expressed solidarity with Qatar’s emir and the people following Monday night’s attacks on a US military base. “We pray for the safety and security of our Qatari brothers and sisters, and the entire region,” he added.
The prime minister said that Pakistan had always advocated dialogue and diplomacy as the only path to lasting peace in the Middle East.
The Qatari ambassador thanked the prime minister for immediately reaching out to him after this “most unfortunate development” as well as for the expression of solidarity at that critical time.
Meanwhile, Ambassador of China to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong on Tuesday lauded the proactive and positive role being played by Pakistan at every diplomatic forum, including at the United Nations Security Council, for a peaceful settlement of the regional security situation through dialogue and diplomacy.

Prime Minister Shehbaz also held a telephone conversation with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, congratulating him on the successful completion of Haj and thanking the Kingdom for its hospitality towards Pakistani pilgrims.
The premier thanked Saudi Arabia for its support to Pakistan during the recent standoff with India. He said Pakistan was ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.
Both leaders also exchanged views on the Middle East crisis and agreed on the need for de-escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the crown prince thanked PM Shehbaz for the telephone call and appreciated Pakistan’s expression of solidarity and support for the Kingdom.
He acknowledged Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the Iran-Israel conflict. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia was fully committed to efforts aimed at fostering lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.
Banquet for Bilawal-led delegation

While exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka recorded notable growth — buoyed in part by changing political dynamics in the region — the overall trade gap continued to expand due to surging imports, particularly from China, India and Bangladesh.
The most concerning trend for policymakers remains the sustained decline in exports to China, Pakistan’s largest trading partner in the region, despite imports from the country surging. This has further deepened the bilateral trade imbalance, with similar patterns observed in trade with India and Bangladesh.
In FY24, Pakistan’s trade deficit with these nine neighbours stood at $9.506bn, reflecting a 49pc increase from $6.382bn in FY23.

Surge in imports from China, India deepens regional trade imbalance

According to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, exports to the region in July-May FY25 edged up 0.98pc to $4.085bn from $4.045bn in the same period last year. In contrast, imports jumped 22.52pc to $15.255bn from $12.451bn a year ago.
A deeper analysis reveals that imports from China surged 22.59pc to $14.890bn in July-May FY25 from $12.146bn. In FY24, imports from China had already risen 39.78pc to $13.506bn from $9.662bn the previous year. China accounts for the bulk of Pakistan’s regional imports, followed by India and Bangladesh.
 
 

Exports to China, however, fell 11.18pc to $2.270bn in the first 11 months of FY25, down from $2.556bn in the same period last year.
Imports from India rose 11.82pc to $211.42m during July-May FY25, compared to $189.07m a year earlier. In FY24, these imports totalled $206.89m, up from $190.04m in FY23. Meanwhile, exports to India remained negligible at $0.51m in 11MFY25, compared to $3.43m last year. In FY24, Pakistan’s exports to India stood at $3.669m, having risen sharply from $0.329m in the preceding year.
Exports to Afghanistan grew significantly by 41.39pc to $723.44m, up from $511.63m in the previous year. Imports from Afghanistan also increased sharply by 142pc to $24.72m from $10.18m. Pakistan’s main export to Afghanistan during FY25 was sugar, with over 700,000 tonnes exported over the past four months alone.
Exports to Bangladesh rose by 21.45pc to $728.31m from $599.65m. Imports from Bangladesh climbed 41.95pc to $73.55m from $51.67m. This boost in trade followed political upheaval in Dhaka and the resumption of rice exports to Bangladesh. Exports to Sri Lanka declined slightly by 3.02pc to $352.37m, compared to $363.36m last year. The drop was attributed to recessionary pressures in Sri Lanka. Imports from the island nation remained unchanged at $54m.

PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan.

• PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan asks whether decision had cabinet nod  • Demands parliament be briefed on Trump-COAS meeting
• Sibghatullah criticises Trump’s role in Israel’s war on Palestine  • NA approves demands for grants of Rs51.6tr for various ministries
ISLAMABAD: Opposition lawm­akers on Tuesday strongly condemned the government’s decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, demanding an explanation for the controversial move.
The government recently posted on X that Mr Trump deserved the award “in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis”.
 






Opposition members questioned the basis of the nomination and sought clarification on what led to such a decision.
Meanwhile, in a significant development towards the passage of the upcoming fiscal year’s budget, the National Assembly approved 108 demands for grants for various ministries and divisions, amounting to over Rs51.6 trillion. The government rejected all 405 cut motions moved by opposition lawmakers, clearing a path for the passage of the budget.
The National Assembly also approved 29 demands, totalling over Rs81.75 billion, for the Cabinet Division for the upcoming fiscal year, dismissing 112 cut motions from the opposition.
During the debate on the cut motions, opposition lawmakers raised the issue of the US president’s Nobel nomination.
PTI leader Ali Muhammad Khan asked if the decision had been approved by the cabinet. Referring to the recent meeting between Mr Trump and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, he said the cabinet and parliament should be briefed on what was discussed during that meeting.
Mr Khan also took the opportunity to clarify the issue of Taliban resettlement in Pakistan, which had been the subject of much controversy. He denied the notion that the repatriation was ordered by Imran Khan during PTI’s tenure, explaining that the matter had been discussed in a 2021 cabinet meeting attended by key federal ministers, and the then army chief and ISI director-general.
He asserted that the proposal was opposed by cabinet members and no decision had been made before the “regime change”, following which Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari became the prime minister and foreign minister, respectively.
Sahibzada Sibghat Ullah also demanded that the people of Pakistan want to know if the decision to nominate Mr Trump for Nobel Peace Prize had been taken by the cabinet or an individual. He questioned the rationale behind the nomination, insisting that Israel devastated Palestine “at the behest of Donald Trump” and also attacked Iran.
Jamshed Dasti also raised the issue, asking if the government had any shame in nominating Mr Trump for the peace prize.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif briefly attended the session but left during Mr Dasti’s speech.
‘Bloated cabinet’
Aliya Kamran of JUI-F pointed out that under Article 92(1) of the Constitution, the number of cabinet members cannot exceed 11 per cent of the total strength of parliament, meaning the limit should be 48 members.
However, she noted that the current cabinet had over 80 members, which she said violated the spirit of the 18th Amendment. She called for a reduction in the cabinet’s size and suggested that the savings should be directed towards public welfare.
Ms Kamran also claimed that the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the Board of Investment were doing overlapping job and funds were being allocated to both. “This anomaly should be removed,” she stressed.
 
 

Winding up the discussion on the cut motions for the Ministry of Commerce, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said the government planned to increase exports to $60bn over the next four years, nearly doubling the current $30.3bn.
He said the government was introducing the Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2024-30 to boost exports. “We identified challenges in each sector, proposed legal and institutional reforms and created a clear roadmap,” he said.
Mr Khan also emphasised the importance of agro-food and food technology exports, saying the government was incorporating food tech into export policies to meet global market demands.
Energy sector
Responding to the opposition’s criticism of the energy sector, Minister for Power Awais Leghari defended the government’s energy policies, claiming that the current administration had reduced electricity prices for 20 million of the 30 million metered consumers. He said that tariffs for consumers using up to 200 units had been reduced by 58pc.
Mr Leghari criticised the previous PTI-led government’s energy deals, particularly those with independent power producers (IPPs). “We have reversed plans that would have burdened consumers with Rs4,500 billion over the next six to seven years,” he claimed.
He also pointed out that losses in power distribution companies (Discos) had decreased by Rs180bn within 11 months under the current administration.
About circular debt, Mr Leghari said the government had developed a six-year plan to eliminate the Rs1.26tr debt and that Rs110bn in overbilling had been refunded to consumers. He also vowed to rationalise the net metering system.

• Salman Akram Raja ‘blindsided’; Saif claims Imran okayed budget from Adiala
PESHAWAR: The midnight passage of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget has exposed deep divisions within the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur claiming that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
The KP Assembly approved the budget around midnight on Monday, bulldozing cut motions on demands for grants, prompting opposition lawmakers to boycott the proceedings.
On Tuesday, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja expressed his surprise at the move. “Passing of the KP budget yesterday has come as a complete surprise to me. On June 22, the Political Committee of the PTI endorsed the decision of the KP parliamentary party to pass the budget, if no meeting with (Imran) Khan Sb is allowed, by the latest date possible to prevent financial chaos,” he wrote on X.
 






Mr Raja said that a meeting with Mr Khan was scheduled on Monday. “The outcome of this meeting and further possible meetings before the 30th should have been awaited before the passing of the KP budget,” he said.
Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra said in a X post that the party needed to put its house in order, adding that the mishandling of the issue had harmed both the party and Imran Khan.
 






“The political committee meeting was called at the last minute, and on Iran. Many of us weren’t able to attend it, including me, and were even surprised that the budget was put up for discussion. Many individuals I heard from later told me they were blindsided by the discussion,” he said.
Mr Jhagra noted that the budget was presented as late as June 18 and that KP was the only government so far to have passed its budget, while Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and the federal governments were yet to do so.
“The passage of the budget could easily have been extended till the 26th and 27th, and space made to get instructions from Imran Khan today,” he said, adding that the budget needed to be passed before June 30 to prevent the federal government from having an excuse to impose an emergency.
‘Minus-one campaign’
On the other hand, KP Chief Minister Gandapur, in a video message posted on social media, accused unnamed people of conspiring to weaken Imran Khan and his agenda.
He said there was a conspiracy to impose governor’s rule in the province in case of the non-passage of the budget. He alleged that some party members also became part of this plan and ran a “minus one” campaign. “Those people are supporting someone else’s agenda,” Mr Gandapur said.
He said the provincial government had the authority to incorporate the party founder’s direction into the budget. However, he said that the budget must be passed according to a schedule.
He said Imran Khan had made it clear on Monday that he was okay with the provincial government’s decision to pass the budget.
KP government spokesperson Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, who met the party’s incarcerated founder in Adiala Jail on Monday, said in a statement that they discussed the provincial budget and other issues in detail.
Barrister Saif said he informed Imran Khan about the legal and constitutional issues related to the budget. He stated that failing to pass the budget on schedule would have resulted in a serious legal and constitutional crisis, leading to the non-payment of salaries and other government expenditures.
He claimed Imran Khan had consented to the budget’s passage and that following further discussions with the chief minister and finance adviser, amendments could still be made. However, he alleged that these officials were not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
In a jibe directed at Barrister Saif, Mr Jhagra posted on social media: “On a lighter note, everyone should go to Adiala with a Barrister Saif mask on. Maybe that will help.”
A KP cabinet member told Dawn that although the budget had to be passed on Monday as per the official schedule, the Assembly secretariat’s agenda indicated that voting on demands for grants and consideration of Finance Bill amendments was scheduled for Tuesday.

He also said that relations with Iran were scarred by an Iranian missile volley at a United States airbase in the Gulf Arab state, but added that he hoped ties would eventually “come back to normal”.
Iran responded to US participation in Israel’s air war against Iran by firing missiles on Monday at the Al Ubeid air base, but no one was hurt after Tehran gave warning, and a ceasefire was announced hours later by Washington.
Qatar, situated just across the Gulf from Iran, has often acted as a mediator in regional conflicts, including between Iran and the US and between Israel and Hamas in the continuing Gaza conflict.
“What happened will definitely have its scar on the relationship [with Iran], but I hope by the time everyone learns the lesson that this kind of neighbourhood relationship should not be violated and should not be undermined,” Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told a press conference with his Lebanese counterpart in Doha.
The prime minister described the attack as “unacceptable” but said Qatar’s response would be “diplomatic and legal”.
“The attack on the State of Qatar is an unacceptable act, especially that the State of Qatar has been making great diplomatic efforts in order to have the situation de-escalated,” he said.
“The partnership between Qatar and the US is just growing stronger … and I hope the good relationship with Iran comes back to normal as soon as possible,” he said.
 


Al Thani added that Qatar had liaised with Iran at Washington’s request to help facilitate the ceasefire.
“We hope the ceasefire will continue as agreed upon, and we urge both the US and Iran to return to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a comprehensive diplomatic solution, something that Qatar has consistently sought,” he said.
He added that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed regret in a phone call with Qatar’s ruling Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani that Tehran’s target in retaliating for US airstrikes was a military base in Qatar.
Sheikh Mohammed also urged Washington and Tehran to resume Oman-mediated talks on Iran’s nuclear programme that were frozen when Israel began striking Iran.
He said that Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was working on resuming talks for a fresh ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.
“We are still continuing our efforts, and God willing, we will try to look for an opportunity during the next two days for having indirect negotiations between the two parties,” he said.
“We hope that the Israeli side will not exploit the ceasefire with Iran to unleash what it wants to unleash on Gaza and continue its bombing of” the strip, Sheikh Mohammed added.
Qatar PM persuaded Iran to accept ceasefire, says source with knowledge of talks
Separately, a source with knowledge of the talks said Qatar’s prime minister persuaded Iran to agree to the US-proposed ceasefire with Israel after Iranian missiles targeted the American base near Doha.
Sheikh Mohammed spoke to the Iranians at Washington’s request following Monday’s unprecedented attack on Qatari soil, the source told AFP.
“In the aftermath of the strikes on Al Udeid [military base], President [Donald] Trump told the Emir of Qatar [that] Israel had signed off on an American ceasefire proposal,” the source said.
“The US president then asked that Qatar help get Iran to agree to a deal,” the source added, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the Qatari prime minister, “who persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians”, the source said.
Israel said today it had agreed to the ceasefire, which is now “in effect”, according to Trump.
Iran has yet to formally accept the truce, but its top security body said the Islamic Republic’s forces had “compelled” Israel to “unilaterally” cease fire.</p><small>2025-06-24 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24210127dcabd90.jpg?r=211208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Two soldiers martyred, 11 terrorists killed in South Waziristan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Two soldiers were martyred and 11 terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On June 24 2025, security Forces conducted an IBO in the general area Sararogha, South Waziristan District, on [the] reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna-al-Khwarij.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan
The statement said that the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “11 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell, while seven khwarij got injured”.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah (age: 37 years, resident of District Chakwal), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of soil Lance Naik Jibran Ullah (age: 27 years, resident of District Bannu),” it added.
The ISPR said that Major Moiz was known for “his courage and daring actions in numerous operations conducted against the khwarij”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR added.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid rich tribute to the martyred soldiers for bravely fighting against the enemy during the operation.
“Major Syed Moiz Abbas and Lance Naik Jibranullah sacrificed their lives for the secure future of the nation. They are true heroes who thwarted the malicious plans of Indian-backed terrorists and eliminated 11 militants,” Naqvi said in a statement.
The interior minister added that “these martyrs gave their lives to deliver a strong message to the enemy and are a proud example of bravery for the nation. Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered by the people.”
Earlier this month, five terrorists were killed during operations in KP’s Peshawar and North Waziristan districts, with the military terming them “Indian-sponsored” ones.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-24 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610758-i-think-minus-imran-khan-has-happened-says-aleema-on-passage-of-kp-budget' target='_blank'><strong>'I think minus Imran Khan has happened', says Aleema on passage of KP budget</strong></a><br><p>

Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 spokesperson Amir Khadam said, “A car with three family members aboard fell into a ravine, resulting in the death of the couple,” adding that the three-year-old son remained safe in the incident.
He said that the family had come to Kaghan from Punjab’s Attock district for a picnic.
“Local people and rescue teams reached the spot as soon as the incident was reported, Khadam said. “The bodies were recovered from the car and immediately taken to the Kaghan Rural Health Centre for first aid.”
He added that the bodies were sent to their native area of Hazro in the Attock district.
On March 5, three employees of a Chinese company working on the Dasu hydropower project were killed when a truck plunged into the Indus River in Upper Kohistan district.
Last month, eight members of a family died when a Rawalpindi-bound Suzuki car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of KP’s Lower Kohistan district.</p><small>2025-06-24 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610763-two-army-officers-martyred-11-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-kps-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Major among two soldiers martyred, 11 Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in KP's South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>

Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
According to Shalkot Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Athar Rashid, “In the tragic incident, five passengers on the bus were killed and seven others were injured.”
He said that the bodies of the deceased had become unrecognisable due to the burns.
“The injured were taken to the Bolan Medical Complex and Civil Hospital, and two of them are in critical condition,” he said.
DSP Rashid added that the local bus was going from Nawan area to Hazarganji when the accident occurred at the Raisani area on the Western Bypass, adding that the bus caught fire after colliding with a petrol-laden loader rickshaw.
In a statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind expressed sorrow over the incident.
“We express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the passengers who died in the tragic accident,” he said. “The injured are being provided with immediate and the best medical assistance. Treatment and facilities are being ensured for them.”
Rind said that an investigation was launched into the incident, stating, “Strict action will be taken against those responsible once the investigation is completed.”
He also said that all possible help and support will be provided to the affected families.
Separately, Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri also extended condolences to the bereaved families, directing authorities to provide facilities to the injured.
He said, “No one will be allowed to play with the lives and property of citizens. [The] Metropolitan Corporation should seize mini petrol pumps and installations established in densely populated areas of the city.”
“Those responsible for the Western Bypass incident will be identified and punished,” he added.
In April, a bus driver was burnt alive and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.
Earlier this year, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway claimed four lives, among them a newly-wed man and his mother, and left six injured when the vehicles caught fire following the accident.</p><small>2025-06-24 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241853074317bff.jpg?r=185525' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919787/novo-nordisk-launches-weight-loss-drug-wegovy-in-india-to-compete-with-lillys-mounjaro' target='_blank'><strong>Novo Nordisk launches weight-loss drug Wegovy in India to compete with Lilly’s Mounjaro</strong></a><br><p>Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk on Tuesday launched its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy in India, three months after Eli Lilly began marketing its rival product Mounjaro in the world’s most populous nation.
Wegovy is already under distribution and is expected to be in pharmacies by the end of the month, Novo Nordisk India Managing Director Vikrant Shrotriya said at a briefing.
Lilly and Novo have been part of obesity awareness programs in India in the lead-up to their drug launches there. The market potential in India, a nation of more than 1.4 billion, is significant, with obesity and diabetes rates steadily climbing.
Sales of Lilly’s weight-loss drug Mounjaro jumped 60 per cent between April and May, industry experts said.
Analysts said Wegovy, a once-a-week injection, had been priced competitively to Mounjaro in India, and that is likely to encourage wider adoption of those drugs.
Global demand for both Mounjaro and Wegovy has skyrocketed in recent years, with supply limited, leading to shortages in countries such as the US.
Novo said in a separate statement to Reuters that it is not anticipating any supply constraints in India.
Wegovy will be available in five dose strengths in India, with 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg versions priced at Rs4,336.25 ($50.71), the company said. The monthly cost would be Rs17,345, similar to Mounjaro. Its 1.7 mg dose will be priced at Rs24,280, and the 2.4 mg version at Rs26,015 for a month’s supply.
Mounjaro, also a once-weekly injection, is priced at Rs3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and 4,375 rupees for a 5 mg vial, its lowest doses, the company said in March. Its highest dose is 15 mg.
Shrikant Akolkar, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Nuvama Institutional Equities, said the pricing is “a little aggressive”, as Wegovy’s active ingredient semaglutide goes off patent next year in India.
“Generic drugmakers will surely launch the generic injection at a steep discount to these prices,” Akolkar said.
India’s generic drugmakers, including Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy’s and Lupin, are racing to produce cheaper copies of Wegovy.
Vishal Manchanda, an analyst at Systematix Institutional Equities, expected Wegovy prices “can correct 60pc to 90pc” once generics enter the market.
About 24pc of women and nearly 23pc of men aged 15 to 49 were either overweight or obese in India, a government survey conducted between 2019 and 2021 showed, up from 20.6pc of women and 19% of men in 2015-2016.
Novo’s Shrotriya said that with the higher dose of Wegovy, “one in three patients achieves 20pc weight loss”, adding it had conducted late-stage trials of injectable semaglutide on 3,500 individuals in India.
Wegovy has helped people lose an average 15pc of their body weight, compared with nearly 23pc achieved by Mounjaro, combined with a healthy diet and exercise, the company has said.
Both Mounjaro and Wegovy belong to a class of therapies known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that help control blood sugar and slow digestion, making people feel fuller for longer.
Wegovy in India will be available in a “pen device”, unlike conventional vials and syringes, the company said.
Novo’s launch in India comes more than a month after the then-CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen was ousted over concerns the company was losing its first-mover advantage in the highly competitive market. Novo is yet to name a replacement.

Asif earlier stressed that Pakistan stood in “complete solidarity” with Iran amid Israel’s unprovoked and “unjustified aggression” against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran’s nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a “ceasefire”.
Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was “preventive”, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic’s part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to Al Jazeera.
In an interview with an Iranian state-run news agency IRNA in Islamabad, Asif said, “Unlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.”
The defence minister emphasised that Iran’s approach had been “very constructive’ and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to “overshadow the region to push the situation towards war”.
He added that “a regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.”
“All these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,” Asif further said.
He condemned Israel’s “terrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran’s nuclear facilities”, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.
“I think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,” he was quoted as saying by IRNA.
“Iran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,” he added.
Asif further said, “It is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.”
He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.
Asif said Israel’s “continued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran”, calling it a “conspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime”.
“Iranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,” he reaffirmed.
He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and “massacring children, women, old and young in Gaza”.
The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because “God is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.”</p><small>2025-06-24 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241802269fa3ae9.jpg?r=180231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919782/india-aviation-regulator-says-multiple-defects-reappearing-on-aircraft' target='_blank'><strong>India aviation regulator says multiple defects reappearing on aircraft</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation regulator said on Tuesday it had found multiple instances of aircraft defects reappearing “many times” at Mumbai and Delhi airports, two of the country’s busiest, indicating what it said were inadequate checks on jetliners.
The findings were part of a special audit being carried out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to strengthen safety in the wake of a deadly Air India crash that killed 271 people earlier this month.
The regulator did not name the airlines where the defects were found or detail the type of defects. The two airports in the world’s third-largest aviation market serve major Indian airlines such as IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express, as well as many international carriers.
The repeated instances of defects indicated “ineffective monitoring and inadequate rectification action”, the DGCA said.
The government body also found other violations such as an aircraft maintenance engineer not taking prescribed safety precautions, not addressing defects in some places and work order not being followed in jet maintenance.
At one airport that the DGCA did not name, the regulator found no survey had been conducted despite new construction around the vicinity, an issue now under scrutiny after the Air India jet crashed into a doctors’ hostel, killing dozens.
The findings have been communicated to the concerned operators so they can take corrective measures within seven days, the DGCA said.
The shortcomings were found as part of a “comprehensive surveillance” during night and early morning hours at major airports including those at Delhi and Mumbai.
After the June 12 crash, the regulator ordered renewed checks on Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet, but it said these did not reveal any major safety concerns.
Reuters reported, citing sources, that the DGCA cancelled its planned visit to Air India headquarters on Tuesday for an annual regulatory audit as the airline was tackling the fallout from several Middle Eastern countries temporarily closing their airspaces due to the Israel-Iran conflict.</p><small>2025-06-24 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2417572600ec9fd.jpg?r=175900' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919777/whatsapp-banned-on-us-house-of-representatives-devices-memo-shows' target='_blank'><strong>WhatsApp banned on US House of Representatives devices, memo shows</strong></a><br><p>Meta Platforms’ WhatsApp messaging service has been banned from all United States House of Representatives devices, according to a memo sent to all House staff on Monday.
The notice said the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.”
The memo, from the chief administrative officer, recommended using other messaging apps, including Microsoft Corp’s Teams platform, Amazon.com’s Wickr, Signal, and Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime.
Meta disagreed with the move “in the strongest possible terms”, a company spokesperson said, noting that the platform provides a higher level of security than the other approved apps.
In January, a WhatsApp official said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions had targeted scores of its users, including journalists and members of civil society.

The number of kids dying around the world will likely go up this year because of the massive cuts to foreign aid, foundation chair Bill Gates said in a statement, adding that funding Gavi was the single most powerful step to stop it.
“The legacy of our generation cannot be that we looked away as millions of poor children died of preventable causes,” said Gates.
“The world now has affordable, effective, proven tools that save lives. Wealthy nations should fully fund Gavi and the Global Fund, the organisations created to get those products to the people who need them.”
The vaccine alliance is looking to raise $9bn for its work from 2026 to 2030 at a pledging event to be held in Brussels on Wednesday. It is co-hosted by the European Union and the Gates Foundation.
The Trump administration had previously indicated that it planned to cut its funding for Gavi, representing around $300 million annually.
Losing US funding could lead to around 1.2m additional deaths over the next five years, Gavi CEO Sania Nishtar had said.

The two-wave strike killed seven in the regional capital of Dnipro, said governor Serhiy Lysak, where the blast wave also shattered train carriage windows and showered passengers with broken glass.
Nearly 70 people, including 10 children, were injured, he said, adding the numbers could still rise. Two people were also killed in the town of Samar, around 10 kilometres from Dnipro, the state emergencies service said.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on Kyiv’s Western partners to respond to the attack. Nato leaders are currently in The Hague for an alliance summit, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hopes to secure more military support against Russia’s full-scale invasion, launched in 2022.
“It is a matter of credibility for allies to step up pressure on Moscow,” Sybiha wrote on X.
He added that schools, kindergartens and a hospital were also damaged in Dnipro. Officials did not provide details of the damage in Samar.
 






Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks, particularly on its capital Kyiv, where 28 people were killed on June 17 in the deadliest such attack this year.
Another 10 people were killed in air attacks on Kyiv and the surrounding region on Monday.</p><small>2025-06-24 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610731-lhc-rejects-imran-khans-eight-bail-pleas-in-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>LHC rejects Imran Khan's bail pleas in May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>

The statement came in response to reports of multiple such attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May,  a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Last Friday, a child was killed and five others were injured after a suspected drone hit South Waziristan District, prompting condemnations from KP politicians.
“Pakistani authorities have failed to take action to protect the lives and property of civilians in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who continue to pay the price of an escalating number of drone strikes in the province,” today’s statement by Amnesty said, quoting the group’s South Asia Deputy Regional Director Isabelle Lassée.
“Use of drones and quadcopters to conduct attacks resulting in the unlawful killing of civilians violates international law. Reports that the strikes have hit homes and volleyball games indicate a reckless disregard for civilian life.”
The statement added that Friday’s drone strike was part of an “alarming series of attacks” which have escalated since March of this year.
 






“While Pakistani authorities have often denied responsibility for these attacks, they are obligated to conduct prompt, independent, transparent and effective investigations into these attacks and bring all those responsible to justice through fair trials.”
Last month, 22 civilians, including children and youth, were injured when a suspected quadcopter dropped munitions in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district, officials confirmed.
The incident occurred near Karmazi Stop on the Wana-Azam Warsak Road.
In October of last year, as many as 13 civilians, mostly children, who received injuries when a quadcopter allegedly dropped explosives on a marketplace in Tirah valley here on Monday, were brought to hospitals in Peshawar for treatment, local sources had told Dawn.</p><small>2025-06-24 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241528415eab188.png?r=153042' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919738/iraq-probes-drone-attacks-on-military-radar-systems' target='_blank'><strong>Iraq probes drone attacks on military radar systems</strong></a><br><p>Iraq will investigate suicide drone attacks on radar systems at two military bases, Sabah al-Numan, the military spokesman for the Iraqi prime minister, said on Tuesday, adding that Iraqi forces intercepted several other attempted incursions.
“Several small suicide drones targeted multiple Iraqi military sites and bases,” according to the spokesman. No casualties were reported.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and the government has not yet identified any perpetrators.
 
 

Numan described the attacks as “cowardly and treacherous”.
“The assault severely damaged radar systems at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar Province” in southern Iraq, he added.
Iraqi forces also thwarted other attacks against “four additional sites across various locations”, Numan said, adding that the drones were downed “before they could reach their intended targets”.
Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordered the formation of “a high-level” committee to investigate the attacks and identify the perpetrators.
Earlier, a security source, requesting anonymity, told AFP that the first attack hit a radar system at the Taji base, and a few hours later, another drone struck the radars at the Imam Ali airbase in Dhi Qar.
A drone fell in the Radwaniya district, 10 kilometres west of Baghdad International Airport, the source said, where United States troops are deployed in a base as part of an anti-jihadist coalition.
No claim
The unidentified drone strikes came hours after Iran launched missiles at a US military facility in Qatar in retaliation for the US bombing of Tehran’s nuclear facilities.
Following the Qatar attack, Israel said it had agreed to US President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire, and Baghdad announced the reopening of its airspace, 12 days after closing it amid the Iran-Israel war.
Security sources who confirmed the drone attacks to AFP could not name any perpetrators.
A source close to the Iran-backed Iraqi factions, who had in previous years hit bases hosting US troops, told AFP that “of course” the groups have nothing to do with the drone attacks. Another source from the factions suggested Israel and the US might be behind them.
A senior security official said, “We don’t know yet if the drones were launched from inside or outside Iraq.”
Iraq, which has for years navigated a delicate balancing act between its allies, Tehran and Washington, has long been a fertile ground for proxy battles.
Since the start of the Iran-Israel war, Baghdad has worked to prevent the violence from spreading onto its turf, especially due to growing fears over possible intervention by Iran-backed armed factions, who have threatened Washington’s interests should it join Israel’s campaign.
Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of stability after decades of devastating conflicts and turmoil.</p><small>2025-06-24 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24144522a78f334.jpg?r=144622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919725/ke-served-show-cause-notice-over-not-complying-with-orders-to-restrict-loadshedding-to-pmt-level' target='_blank'><strong>KE served show cause notice over not complying with orders to restrict loadshedding to PMT level</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has issued a show cause notice to K-Electric (KE) after the power distribution company failed to submit a satisfactory reply over discriminatory policies over loadshedding in Karachi.
Nepra had earlier taken serious notice of alleged excessive and persistent loadshedding during summers, and directed KE to end consumers’ miseries.
In a letter to the KE chief executive officer, the regulatory body stated that it had received a large number of complaints regarding persistent and excessive loadshedding across various areas of Karachi.
In a notice issued on June 23, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the power regulatory said the power distribution companies are obligated to supply electricity on a “non-discriminatory” basis to all consumers, and shall have schedules to shed up to 30pc of its load on instructions of the NTDC.
When instructed, power distribution companies (Discos) can announce loadshedding in the order namely: supply to rural areas, residential consumers in urban area, agriculture consumers, industries, school and hospitals, and defence installations.
The regulator said power companies should prepare loadsheding schedules in a non- discriminatory manner.
Nepra sought on explanation from KE on January 8, 2025, for non-compliance of the of the authority’s orders, and carrying out loadshedding in violation of Nepra Act.
In this regard, a feeder containing commercial losses (theft and non-payment of dues by some consumers) is completely switched off for some hours a day despite the fact that some consumers are regular paying consumers.
“This establishes that compliant consumers are unnecessarily being punished due to some defaulters,” it added.
Nepra said the power company can carry out load shedding at pole-mounted transformer (PMT) level on the instructions of the regulator or in case of generation shortage and transmission constraints.
It said KE has installed AMI/AMR meters to identify specific energy losses at transformer level and could remotely disconnect the supply. However, despite achieving commercial benefits, it is “not ready to provide relief to the people of Karachi”.
It added that during public hearings regarding Fuel Cost Adjustment (FCA), the “people of Karachi largely complained about excessive loadshedding”.
Nepra has issued directives KE to start loadshedding on PMT level instead of feeder level, but noted a serious non-compliance which has led to “undue suffering of good paying consumers and faced discriminatory behaviour in terms of receiving electric power supply which (is) their basic right.”
KE submitted in response on January 27, 2025, and after detailed deliberation, Nepra concluded that the power company failed to provide a satisfactory explanation.
Nepra served a show cause notice to the power company and instructed to submit a reply within fifteen days.
It warned that failure to comply could lead to a maximum penalty of Rs200 million and further penalty of Rs100,000 per day.</p><small>2025-06-24 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610747-senior-uae-official-mohamed-saif-al-suwaidi-receives-pakistans-prestigious-hilal-e-quaid-e-azam-award' target='_blank'><strong>Senior UAE official Mohamed Saif Al Suwaidi receives Pakistan's prestigious Hilal-e-Quaid-e-Azam Award</strong></a><br><p>

Doshi died in London on Monday, Indian media reported.
The left-arm spinner was already in his thirties when he made his Test debut in 1979, and finished with 114 wickets in 33 matches.
Doshi also played 15 one-day internationals for India between 1980 and 1982.
Cricket veteran Sachin Tendulkar said Doshi was a “warm-hearted soul”, adding that he “will miss those cricketing conversations”.
Former all-rounder Ravi Shastri said that Doshi was “a gentleman to the core and a fine, fine bowler”.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) also paid tribute to the former spinner.
A bespectacled Doshi carried forward the Indian spin legacy started by the famous quartet of Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Srinivas Venkataraghavan and Bhagwath Chandrasekhar.
Doshi bamboozled world batsmen and played English County cricket, with a long stint with Nottinghamshire.</p><small>2025-06-24 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610687-five-killed-after-passenger-bus-catches-fire-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Five killed after passenger bus catches fire in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

According to a press release by the CMA, Britain’s competition regulator, Google search accounts for more than 90 per cent of all general search queries in the UK — with millions of people relying on it as a key gateway to the internet and more than 200,000 businesses in the UK relying on Google search advertising to reach their customers.
The CMA said that steps it could take include making it easier for users to access different search providers and ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses appearing on Google search.
It also proposed more transparency and control for publishers whose content appeared in search results if it goes ahead with the designation in October.
Google will be the first company designated since the regulator gained new powers this year.
 
 

“The UK’s new Digital Markets Competition Regime can help unlock opportunities for innovation and growth, by promoting competition in digital markets while protecting UK consumers and businesses from unfair or harmful practices,” the CMA said.
Google said the move could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in Britain.
“We’re concerned that the scope of the CMA’s considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,” said Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director for competition.</p><small>2025-06-24 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24111221e5320c2.jpg?r=111226' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919657/supreme-court-lifts-limits-on-trump-deporting-migrants-to-countries-not-their-own' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court lifts limits on Trump deporting migrants to countries not their own</strong></a><br><p>The US Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for President Donald Trump’s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harm they could face, handing him another victory in his aggressive pursuit of mass deportations.
In an action that prompted a sharp dissent from its three liberal justices, the court granted the administration’s request to lift a judicial order requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell US officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out.
Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy had issued the order on April 18.
The Supreme Court’s brief order was unsigned and offered no reasoning, as is common when it decides emergency requests. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.
 
 

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the two other liberal justices, called the decision a “gross abuse” of the court’s power.
“Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,” Sotomayor wrote.
Sotomayor called the court’s action “as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”
Murphy had found that the administration’s policy of “executing third-country removals without providing notice and a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims” likely violates the US Constitution’s due process protections. Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.
After the Department of Homeland Security moved in February to step up rapid deportations to third countries, immigrant rights groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a group of migrants seeking to prevent their removal to such places without notice and to gain chance to assert the harms they could face.
Murphy on May 21 found the Trump administration violated his order requiring additional steps before attempting to send a group of migrants to politically unstable South Sudan, which the US State Department has urged Americans to avoid “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.” The judge’s intervention prompted the US government to keep the migrants at a military base in Djibouti.
After the US Supreme Court ruling, Murphy in a court order made clear that his decision preventing the rapid deportation of eight men to South Sudan “remains in full force and effect.”
 
 

Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which helps represent the plaintiffs, called the ramifications of the court’s action “horrifying,” stripping away “critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.”
The administration told the Supreme Court that its third-country policy already complied with due process and is critical for removing migrants who commit crimes because their countries of origin are often unwilling to take them back. It said that all the South Sudan-destined migrants had committed “heinous crimes” in the United States, including murder, arson and armed robbery.
“The Supreme Court’s stay of a left-wing district judge’s injunction reaffirms the president’s authority to remove criminal illegal aliens from our country and Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said after Monday’s decision.
“Fire up the deportation planes,” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.
A flood of cases
The dispute is one of many legal challenges to Trump policies to have reached the nation’s highest judicial body since he returned to office in January.
The Supreme Court in May let Trump end humanitarian programs for hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the United States temporarily. The justices, however, faulted the administration’s treatment of some migrants whom Trump targeted for removal under the Alien Enemies Act — a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime — as inadequate under constitutional due process protections.
Sotomayor said that in sending migrants to South Sudan, and in another instance four others to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on to El Salvador, the administration “openly flouted two court orders” issued by Murphy. Sotomayor also pointed to the separate Alien Enemies Act litigation in which questions were raised about the administration’s compliance with an order issued by a judge in that case.
“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote.
“Yet each time this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”
The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals on May 16 declined to put Murphy’s decision on hold.
Reuters has also reported that US officials had been considering sending migrants to Libya, another politically unstable country, despite previous US condemnation of Libya’s harsh treatment of detainees.</p><small>2025-06-24 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610676-pakistan-resumes-flight-operations-after-gulf-airspace-reopens' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan resumes flight operations after Gulf airspace reopens</strong></a><br><p>

Witnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel.
Israel’s military said six waves of missiles were launched by Iran and Israel’s national ambulance service said four people were killed in Beersheba, the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump announced the ceasefire late on Monday.
Trump said on Tuesday a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was now in place and asked both countries not to violate it, only hours after Iran launched waves of missiles, which Israel’s ambulance service said killed four people.
“The ceasefire is now in effect. Please do not violate it!” he said in a Truth Social post.
Earlier, a senior White House official said Trump had brokered a ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks.
“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site.
 


An Iranian official earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, but the country’s foreign minister said there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.
Abbas Araqchi said early on Tuesday that if Israel stopped its “illegal aggression” against the Iranian people no later than 4am Tehran time (5:30am PKT) on Tuesday, Iran had no intention of continuing its response afterwards.
“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,” Araqchi added in a post on X.
 






Trump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would have some time to complete any missions that are underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process.
Iran’s semi-official SNN news agency reported on Tuesday that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.
Israel, joined by the United States on the weekend, has carried out attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, after alleging Tehran was getting close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies ever having a nuclear weapons program but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to, world leaders “wouldn’t be able to stop us”.
Israel, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday.
US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were in direct and indirect contact with the Iranians, a White House official said.
Neither Irans UN mission nor the Israeli embassy in Washington responded to separate requests for comment from Reuters.
Hours earlier, three Israeli officials had signaled Israel was looking to wrap up its campaign in Iran soon and had passed the message on to the United States.
Netanyahu had told government ministers whose discussions ended early on Tuesday not to speak publicly, Israel’s Channel 12 television reported.
Markets reacted favourably to the news. S&P 500 futures rose 0.4 per cent late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday.
US crude futures fell in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than a week after Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed, relieving worries of supply disruption in the region.
End to the fighting?
There did not appear to be calm yet in the region.
The Israeli military issued two evacuation warnings in less than two hours to residents of areas in the Iranian capital Tehran, one late on Monday and one early on Tuesday.
Israeli Army radio reported early on Tuesday that alarms were activated in the southern Golan Heights area due to fears of hostile aircraft intrusion.
Earlier on Monday, Trump said he would encourage Israel to proceed towards peace after dismissing Iran’s attack on an American air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for the early notice of the strikes.
He said Iran fired 14 missiles at the US air base, calling it “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.
Iran’s handling of the attack recalled earlier clashes with the United States and Israel, with Tehran seeking a balance between saving face with a military response but without provoking a cycle of escalation it can’t afford.
Iran’s attack came after US bombers dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Iranian underground nuclear facilities at the weekend, joining Israel’s air war.
Much of Tehran’s population of 10 million has fled after days of bombing.
The Trump administration maintains that its aim was solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, not to open a wider war.
“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”
“Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,” Vance said.
Trump has cited intelligence reports that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, without elaborating.
However, US intelligence agencies said earlier this year they assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and a source with access to US intelligence reports told Reuters last week that that assessment hadn’t changed.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Israel, however, had made clear that its strikes on Evin prison — a jail for housing political prisoners — and other targets in Tehran were intended to hit the Iranian ruling apparatus broadly, and its ability to sustain power.</p><small>2025-06-24 05:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610672-will-karachi-receive-rain-today' target='_blank'><strong>Will Karachi receive rain today?</strong></a><br><p>
