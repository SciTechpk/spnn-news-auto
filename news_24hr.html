But thanks to climate change, hydro-politics between countries is witnessing a manifold increase in intensity. On the one hand, climate change is compounding the problem of water scarcity and, on the other, it is triggering heavier rainfalls and flooding.
Various countries share common sources of fresh water. For this, they sign water-sharing treaties. Recognition of these treaties involves the signatory nations and international organisations. There is no single global authority to enforce these agreements, though.
In a 2023 essay, the sustainability specialist Emmanuel Gutman-Gates wrote that the increasing frequency of water-related conflicts and the ‘weaponisation of water’ in specific instances suggest that water politics is a growing source of instability and conflict.
The water dispute over the Indus River, for example, is a major source of tension between India and Pakistan. In April this year, India “suspended” the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) that was signed in 1960 between the two countries. This has escalated the threat of serious confrontation between the two historically antagonistic neighbours. 

From the Indus to the Rio Grande, rivers are no longer just lifelines — they are now battlefronts. As climate change shrinks and floods waterways, nations are turning treaties into weapons and neighbours into rivals

In August, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that the IWT does not allow for unilateral suspension. But India rejected the verdict. Pakistan’s army chief allegedly responded by claiming that it would take just 10 missiles for Pakistan to destroy any new dams built by India to disrupt the water supply to Pakistan.
 
 

River Indus is Pakistan’s largest river. It originates in Tibet and then goes through India before entering Pakistan. Climate change is disrupting the flow of the river, which is an important water source for both countries. Pakistan has often accused India of using its upstream position to threaten its water supply.
Nevertheless, in May this year, the former irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari wrote in The Nation, “The IWT treaty now risks obsolescence — designed for a bygone era, it is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of climate change and geopolitical volatility.” The treaty needs to be reframed, but India’s recent act of suspending it has further compounded the issue.
Afghanistan has been facing a scarcity of water. The River Amu Darya is a vital source of water for Afghanistan and its northern neighbours, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The Taliban regime in Kabul is planning to make a canal, which is likely to lessen the flow of Amu into Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan by 15 percent. Both the countries are now negotiating with Kabul to resolve the issue peacefully.
The Kabul River, which flows into Pakistan from Afghanistan, sustains the lives of millions of people on both sides. There have been attempts by Afghanistan to build dams on this river, which Pakistan fears are likely to disrupt the supply of water to Pakistan. However, due to constant political turmoil and civil wars in Afghanistan, no such major dam has been built yet. Nevertheless, Pakistan is eager to sign a water treaty with Kabul sooner than later.
Water reserves in Iraq have hit their lowest levels in 80 years. This is straining Iraq’s relations with its upstream neighbours Iran and Turkey, who are blatantly restricting flows in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq. According to the researcher Hayder Al-Shakeri, the Iraqi government has, however, failed to respond with professional water diplomacy. Corruption among Iraq’s political elite has weakened institutional capacity. This creates openings for Turkey and Iran to press for deals that serve their own priorities.
 


Another long-running hydro-political flashpoint has been over the Jordan River. The tension in this regard is mainly between Israel and Jordan. Both the countries signed a water treaty in 1994 to diplomatically resolve the issue, but climate change, wars in the region and an increase in the populations of Jordan and Israel are severely testing the treaty.
The River Rio Grande, which flows from the US to Mexico, has been rapidly dwindling due to climate change, overuse and outdated water management practices. It is a source of a decades-long dispute between the US and Mexico. Rio Grande is also one of the most endangered rivers in the world. Mexico has fallen behind on its commitments under the 1944 US-Mexico Water Treaty.
 
 

However, this year, the US and Mexico announced that they would ‘upgrade’ the treaty according to current needs and conditions. But experts believe the current framework is still inadequate to fully resolve the issue due to the river drying up at an alarming pace.
Water politics has also become a prominent part of the internal politics of various countries. This includes political and social issues surrounding the management, allocation and distribution of water resources within a country’s borders.
For example, water disputes between states/provinces in India are intensifying due to disagreements over the use, distribution and control of inter-state river waters. It is one of the tensest issues in Indian federalism today. India has just four per cent of the world’s freshwater supplies but holds a massive 18 per cent of the world’s total population.
Pakistan’s two major provinces, Punjab and Sindh, are constantly locking horns over the waters of River Indus. Climate change is intensifying this tussle, especially with monsoon patterns becoming unpredictable. Indus River flows are likely to decrease and the risk of both floods and droughts likely to increase. There is now greater awareness of climate change among most people, but it only receives obligatory lip-service from the governments and the state.
 
 

For example, political opponents are more invested in pulling each other’s legs for failing to control flash flooding in major urban areas. There has been no show of any serious intent by the state and politicians to address the impacts of climate change beyond attacking each other for being incompetent.
In south-eastern Australia, the vast river system and drainage basin, the Murray-Darling Basin, is a flashpoint for internal water politics involving states and farmers. A major government initiative — the Basin Plan — to resolve the issue has continued to be ineffective due to disputes between federal and state governments, with New South Wales and Victoria often reluctant to accept the plan.
In the US, long-running battles over shared water resources have intensified due to the impact of climate change, particularly involving the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins. In Ethiopia, serious water imbalances between regions have been a major issue in the country’s politics.
Environmental activists spent decades to finally make the term ‘climate change’ a frequent part of everyday vocabulary — even among its deniers. Yet, it remains a vague term for many because, despite experiencing its impacts more than ever, no one seems to know how to address it. This is not to suggest that there are no solutions. But most of these require dramatic changes in political policies and in established lifestyle practices, which can create social, economic and political disruptions.
But one wonders: what more can be more disruptive than melting glaciers, increasing droughts, frequent floods, unprecedented rainfalls, dying rivers and water disputes that can lead to outright wars between nations?
Published in Dawn, EOS, September 6th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-07 03:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bb708bde187.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940105/deadly-arrogance' target='_blank'><strong>Deadly arrogance</strong></a><br><p>RELIGIONS, particularly Islam, are supposed to address the ethical ills that afflict mankind. In fact, in Islamic tradition, akhlaq (morals, ethics) is a well-developed science, deriving lessons from the Quran and ahadith on how to deal with ethical situations across the spectrum of life.
Moreover, the Holy Prophet (PBUH), whose noble birth we celebrate today, is considered the perfect ethical exemplar, who taught us how to behave in family settings and in the workplace, during war and during peace, individually and socially, etc.
Amongst the biggest ethical evils, as per the Quran and the teachings of the Blessed Prophet, are arrogance and pride, which, unfortunately, are found in abundance in all settings. This can range from states practising arrogance, for example, when the powerful and unaccountable unleash death and destruction upon innocents, as Israel and the US are currently doing in Gaza. It can also include how we treat those with less power and money than us, for example domestic staff, street vendors etc.
 
 

The Quran is very clear on how arrogance is a reviled trait in the eyes of the Almighty. One of the archetypes of arrogance repeatedly mentioned in the Holy Book is pharaoh, whose haughty utterances and actions are thoroughly condemned. For example, in Surah Naziyat pharaoh, a mere mortal, boasts that “I am your lord, most high.” Elsewhere, in Surah Zukhruf, pharaoh wrongly claims that Egypt’s mighty Nile flows under his feet. Compare this to the clear warning in Surah Isra, where man is commanded not to walk on the earth arrogantly.
Authentic ahadith are equally critical of the arrogant. As per one hadith, it is stated that “there is a special section for the arr­ogant people in hell”. At another point it is stated that “the one who is arrogant will be degraded by Allah”, while yet another tradition warns that “the worst kind of pride is considering the creatures lowly”.

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) treated the weakest with dignity.

Throughout his blessed life, the Holy Prophet displayed disdain for arrogance, and preferred humility and simplicity to vanity and ostentation. In fact, apart from his insistence on tauheed (monotheism), the tribal aristocrats of Makkah took exception to the fact that he treated the weakest individuals in that society — slaves, women, children, orphans, those without strong tribal affiliation — with dignity and respect.
How could a ‘low-born’ slave be considered equal in the eyes of the Almighty to a ‘high-born’ merchant of Makkah belonging to a powerful tribe, they wondered. For them, this amounted to ‘blasphemy’. Sadly, these pre-Islamic prejudices, with roots in jahiliya, have survived, as even in our society caste, tribe and financial position can define an individual’s status in society, rather than the strength of their character.
 
 

In fact, these prejudices are not limited to tribal or rural parts of the country; such attitudes thrive even in the cities where wealth — gained by means fair or foul — is the marker of success and status. The poor are an afterthought, not worthy of human dignity. Islam strongly condemns such vile attitudes.
In the view of the Most High, the best among humanity are the “most righteous”, while in a hadith, those with the best character are equated with those with the best faith. In the divine hierarchy, money, family connections and other ephemeral affiliations have no value; only a person’s character counts. And nothing destroys character like arrogance.
The most knowledgeable individual to ever walk the earth — the Holy Prophet, described as the ‘City of knowledge’ in a hadith — was a picture of humility. Thr­toughout history, even apart from prophets, the people of knowledge have always been humble. When they reflect on the realities of the universe — the vastn­ess of the cosmos, the ancientness of time, the deeper mysteries of creation — they realise they know nothing, and prostrate before Allah Almighty, who “tau­ght man which he knew not”. When the people of knowledge express their total helplessness and humility before the Most High, on what basis do the arrogant walk haughtily on the land?
 
 

And when arrogance mixes with ignorance, the results are lethal. After all, as per a saying of Hazrat Ali, “ignorance is death for the living”. Unfortunately, in our society the arrogant and the ignorant — the ‘living dead’ in the light of this saying — appear to dominate, while the people of knowledge are brushed aside as weak and unworthy, or harassed for speaking the truth.
But we must remember that arrogance is a death sentence in this world and the next, as the fate of pharaoh and those of his ilk demonstrates. The only solution, as per the Quran and the Holy Prophet’s example, lies in humility and character-building, while giving dignity and respect to all, regardless of ‘social’ and monetary status.

Several factors contribute to this sobering reality including poor access to healthcare and inadequate resources. Which is why regular vaccine campaigns, undertaken to prevent the onset of many of the illnesses seen mostly in developing nations, are absolutely crucial in a country like ours. In this context, the planned addition of a new vaccine to the Expanded Programme on Immunisation is a welcome development.
 
 

The campaign for the phased rollout of the human papillomavirus vaccine to prevent cervical cancer is set to begin on Sept 15. In Sindh, the aim is to immunise 4.1m girls from nine to 14 years against the virus — although once incorporated fully in the EPI, the focus will shift to nine-year-olds and hopefully become part of a school-outreach programme. The campaign will be rolled out in Punjab, ICT and AJK at the same time; in KP in 2026; and in Balochistan and GB in 2027.
Without regular screening, cervical cancer can go undetected in females, especially as symptoms may be absent in the early stages. And in a country like Pakistan, where routine pelvic examinations are not actively recommended, negligence can cost lives.
 
 

Around 5,000 women in the country are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year; 60pc of them succumb to the disease. And these are only the numbers recorded. It is safe to assume that the actual number of cases for this cancer — the second most common one among women of child-bearing age — is far higher.
By including the vaccine in the EPI, then, it is hoped that awareness levels are heightened — perhaps, the mothers of the young girls that the HPV vaccine will target under the EPI will learn enough about the risks of cervical cancer to take precautionary steps themselves through inoculation or regular screening. It appears to be a goal worth pursuing.

A notification has been issued in this regard on the directions of Housing Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal.
According to a spokesperson for the housing department, development authorities, horticulture agencies, and Wasa agencies would provide resources for relief operations in the affected districts.
 
 

The notification said that development authorities and horticulture agencies would extend all possible support to the districts.
Uninterrupted supply of clean drinking water in flood relief camps would be ensured, while officers had been directed to remain present in the relief camps of the affected districts round-the-clock.
The spokesperson said that officers and employees of development authorities and horticulture agencies would work under Wasa’s disposal so that relief operation could be made faster and more effective.

According to the FIR, seven residents of Kamiraan village, along with 10 unknown persons, were breaking the temporary protective dyke around the village with heavy machinery and tractors at 7pm on September 4.
When the locals intervened, they beat them up, fired in the air and threatened to kill them. However, the men fled when a large police contingent arrived at the scene after being informed by the local residents.
 
 

It is pertinent to mention here that many temporary protective dykes built by locals at various places in the 160 kilometer-long Sutlej belt in Bahawalnagar have broken. Due to this, thousands of acres of land have been submerged and dozens of villages of Minchinabad, Bahawalnagar and Chishtian have been affected by the river and they have been cut-off from the cities.
On Thursday night, another large protective dyke near the bridge connecting Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal at Bhukan Pattan on Arifwala Road broke, not only flooding several settlements, but also raising concerns that Bahawalnagar will be cut off from other cities.

Youth drowns in floodwater

However, the locals were making every effort to repair the dyke. On the other hand, the district administration issued an alert to the relevant departments expressing fears of extremely high levels of flooding in the Sutlej and also appealed to the public to take precautionary measures.
Meanwhile, a teenager died by drowning in the floodwater in Chishtian on Friday.
Rescue officials said that deceased Shahzad (16) worked at the house of a landlord in the Sial settlement of Jhaiduan mouza. They said that the settlement was surrounded by floodwater on all sides, but most of the residents had not moved to safer places.
According to the officials, Shahzad slipped and drowned in the deep floodwater after leaving the house. He was later pulled out by the locals.
Rescue 1122 shifted the body to Chishtian THQ for legal formalities.

The subcommittee of the Senate House Committee headed by Senator Nasir Mehmood met on Friday. The participants stressed that there was no justification for further delay.
Senators Danesh Kumar, Hidayatullah Khan and Poonjo Bheel also attended the meeting.
The committee noted with concern that although the project was approved as far back as 2009 to meet the growing accommodation needs of parliamentarians, it has remained plagued by repeated delays.
 







CDA says work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political gatherings near site

CDA officials said work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political disruptions near the site. In 2015, the contractor demanded a steep cost escalation, leading to prolonged litigation. The committee was told that in 2025 a revised PC-I was approved at a cost of Rs7,170 million, and the contract was awarded to Mian Usman Umer & Company.
The committee observed that the prolonged delays have multiplied costs, adding with Rs3.5 billion already available, there was no justification for further inaction. Senator Mehmood directed CDA to immediately commence work and said timely completion is essential to avoid yet another cycle of cost escalations and litigation.
The committee further directed that the ministries of interior and planning must conduct site visits and submit progress reports to ensure consistent progress and transparency and accountability in the work. The committee will also visit the site.
On the matter of renovation of existing lodges, the committee expressed dissatisfaction over the deteriorated condition of the buildings despite claims of heavy expenditures.
 
 

The members said that thorough inspections will be carried out, and CDA was tasked to provide lodge-wise details of renovation costs, materials used, and justification for excessive spending.
The head of the committee remarked that accountability in the use of public money is non-negotiable and that disproportionate spending on a few lodges will not be tolerated.
The committee directed the chairman CDA to constitute an internal committee comprising well-reputed officers to conduct the initial investigations into the quality of the work and spending of amounts on each lodge during last two years.
The convener of the subcommittee pressed for transparency, demanding that CDA submit an internal inquiry report within 21 days.
The committee also raised the issue of poor cleanliness standards at Parliament Lodges. Members noted that janitorial staffers deputed for the task were not performing their duties effectively. Details of the janitorial contract, staff deployment and associated costs were sought.
The chairman CDA highlighted the additional financial burden on the civic agency due to the absorption of PWD employees after the department’s closure.
He requested supplementary funding to meet salary obligations.
The committee directed the ministries of finance and interior to resolve the matter on priority, stressing that institutional gaps should not hinder operational efficiency.

A spokesman for the FIA said in a statement one of the suspects was posted as Deputy Director at FGEHF. Other suspects are beneficiaries of funds obtained through corruption and fraud, said the spokesman.
According to the initial investigation, the suspects are involved in forgery and fraud by abusing their authority. They were involved in forgery and corruption in the supplementary award of built-up properties (BUPs) of sub-sectors of Mouza Thala Sayedan G-14.
The accused allegedly illegally showed private individuals as co-owners of 5 BUPs, along with the BUPs given to the original owners. Private individuals received funds based on false information.
 
 

The FIA said that the accused committed the forgery with the connivance of government officials.
The aforementioned fraud caused a loss of millions of rupees to the national treasury. The suspects have been arrested and an investigation has been launched against them, said the spokesman.
Meanwhile, FIA’s four sub-inspectors and an LDC involved in poor investigation and breach of discipline were dismissed from their jobs.
The dismissal of five officials came about during the “orderly room” conducted by director general FIA Rifat Mukhtar Raja. The FIA spokesman said that the DG FIA held a hearing on departmental actions against officials involved in malicious and poor investigation and breach of discipline in the orderly room.
The convicted officers were posted in Islamabad, Faisalabad and Lahore zones. The DG FIA said that there is no place for officials involved in negligence, carelessness and poor investigation in the institution. Disciplinary action will be ensured against officials involved in corruption, malpractice and negligence, the DG said.

The board will not only receive applications from aspiring candidates but will also recommend the most suitable candidate to the leadership to ensure effective public service through the party’s best representative.
PML-N Divisional President Malik Ibrar Ahmed said the party was the true representative of public aspirations.
He added that, in line with the leadership’s directions, a transparent and consultative process will be adopted to finalise the candidate.
“PML-N firmly believes in democratic values and is committed to meeting the trust of the people of Ward No. 8,” he added.

Israr Khan, a public relations officer of the district police, had told Dawn that the injured were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Khar.
He also said terrorists launched another attack on the police station through a quadcopter but it missed the target.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Hamid Sindhu and City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar later reached the site for an inspection and were briefed by officials present there.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths, including children on board the boat, have been confirmed,” DC Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also put the toll at five.
He ordered the rescue authorities to immediately intensify the search operation. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people on board the boat,” Sindhu said.
Meanwhile, CPO Dogar said police teams were providing full support to Rescue 1122 and the initial reasons for the boat accident included the darkness and flooded routes.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that the boat had hit a tree and capsized due to the strong water flow, along with the women and children on board not able to maintain their balance, while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala.
It added that most of the women and children were aboard the boat and the depth of the water was 15 to 20 feet.
The report said personnel launched search and rescue operations and four bodies were retrieved, while the rest of the people were recovered. “Line searching and boat searching are being conducted at different places to search for one child,” it said.
A statement from the department said Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer expressed grief over the deaths and ordered the divisional emergency officer to immediately share the incident report.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan also expressed grief over the deaths and extended his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Kathia directed that the best medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“Evacuation of victims should be made safe in a flood situation. There should be no overloading in private boats or rescue boats,” he ordered.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and extended her condolences to the families of the victims.
 






Rescue 1122 said that it had rescued more than 9,000 people in flood operations from Multan alone, while over 350,000 people and above 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.</p><small>2025-09-06 18:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06230538e87ca66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940217/trump-back-in-sports-spotlight-at-us-open-final' target='_blank'><strong>Trump back in sports spotlight at US Open final</strong></a><br><p>Donald Trump will become the first sitting United States president to attend the US Open in a quarter-century on Sunday, as he joins the legions of fans in New York to catch a highly anticipated showdown between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.
Republican Trump has attended numerous sports events to meet with his supporters, but he may not receive the warmest welcome at the US Open in deeply Democratic New York City.
He was once a fixture of the tournament before taking office and in 2015 was booed by some tennis fans not long after launching his presidential campaign.
Ticketholders can expect extraordinary security measures at the sprawling Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Trump’s home borough, Queens, where the final tennis major of 2025 is on track for a fourth straight year of record-setting attendances.
While the pricey playground for tennis fanatics and designer-clad social media influencers regularly brings in an array of A-listers, the tournament has not seen a sitting US president since Bill Clinton attended in 2000.
Barack and Michelle Obama attended in 2023, six years after the Democratic president left office.
Second seed Alcaraz said he would try not to think about Trump in the crowd as he bids for his sixth Grand Slam title.
“I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it,” the Spaniard told reporters on Friday after defeating 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.
“But I think, you know, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president at the final.”
Megawatt spotlight
Trump is far from the first US president to step into the megawatt spotlight of professional sports.
Barack appeared on ESPN to fill out his “March Madness” bracket while in office and George W Bush famously threw out the first pitch at Shea Stadium in 2001, when the Mets took on the Atlanta Braves for the city’s first major sporting event after the September 11 attacks.
But few have embraced sports’ biggest events with the same gusto as Trump, particularly in his second term.
Trump grabbed headlines when he became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl in February, stepping into the media glare of America’s most-watched annual event.
The fans at New Orleans’ Superdome greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos, and he met briefly in the stadium with families of the victims of the New Year’s Day attack on Bourbon Street as well as police officers and emergency workers.
Months later, Trump announced from the White House that Washington, DC, would host the 2027 NFL Draft, an annual mega-event that regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of fans.
He attended FIFA’s Club World Cup final in July, where he sat in box seats at MetLife Stadium with FIFA boss Gianni Infantino and remained on the stage during the trophy lift with winners Chelsea, to the confusion of some of the players.
Days after Alcaraz and top seed Sinner play, Trump is expected to attend the New York Yankees game against the Detroit Tigers on the 24th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
Later this month, he is expected to attend the Ryder Cup, the biennial international golf competition, on Long Island.
At the US Open, Trump will attend as a “client guest”, organisers said, and will watch from that guest’s respective suite at the famed Arthur Ashe Stadium.
“It is a privilege for the tournaments having the president from every country just to support the tournament, to support tennis and to support the match,” Alcaraz said.</p><small>2025-09-06 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622313-four-drown-after-boat-carrying-flood-victims-capsizes-in-punjabs-jalalpur' target='_blank'><strong>Four drown after boat carrying flood victims capsizes in Punjab's Jalalpur</strong></a><br><p>

The Defence Day is observed every year on September 6 to commemorate the legacy of the 1965 War, “when the Indian forces crossed international border in the darkness of night to attack Pakistan but the nation foiled [the] nefarious designs of the enemy,” a report by the state broadcaster Radio Pakistan recalled.
The report said the commemoration began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salute in provincial capitals.
“Special prayers were offered in mosques for the progress and prosperity of the country, and independence of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir from the clutches of India,” it added.
Karachi marked Defence Day with a changing of the guard at Quaid-i-Azam’s mausoleum, performed by a contingent from the Pakistan Air Force.
DawnNewsTV broadcast images showing personnel marching, performing elaborate display drills, singing the national anthem and hoisting the flag at the Karachi landmark.
Air Vice Marshal Shehryar Khan also attended the ceremony.

In his address broadcast on DawnNewsTV, he said: “The people and protectors of Pakistan, whether they are on the battlefield, the frontiers or in the streets of our cities, are always prepared.
“The recent operation Bunyanum Marsoos brought back the memory of September 6, 1965. It proved that if our armed forces and brave people stand together, then no power can defeat us
“… Any act of aggression against Pakistan will be met with a befitting response. The score will not be 6-0, but, with the help of God, 60-0,” he added.
 


During a brief military confrontation with India in May, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7.
In Lahore, a changing of the guard ceremony took place at Mazar-i-Iqbal, with Lahore Corps Commander Lieutenant General Fayyaz Hussain Shah attending as the chief guest, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
“The corps commander visited Iqbal’s mausoleum, where he laid a wreath of flowers and recited the fatiha,” the report read.
PTV News added that the occasion was commemorated with a 21-gun salute, as well as a gun salute by a contingent from the Pakistan Army.
‘Courage of fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations’
A statement issued by the military’s media affairs wing in relevance to the day said that on behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid tributes and “offered their deepest respect to the valiant martyrs and their families on the 60th Defence and Martyrs’ Day”.
“September 6, 1965, epitomises the unflinching resolve and unshakeable spirit of the Pakistani nation. On this historic day, our brave soldiers, with the support of nation, stood like an insurmountable wall against blatant aggression, thwarting the nefarious designs of an enemy far superior in arms and numbers.
“The feats of heroic valour and sacrifice left an indelible message on the sands of time, that a united nation can never be defeated,” it added.
The statement further stated that the “courage of our fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations and their legacy shall live on forever”.

“Today, the nation honours and salutes its martyrs, its ghazis and their resilient families who have offered unparalleled sacrifices for the security of this great country,” it said.
Recalling that the armed forces had stood resolutely against external aggression and terrorism and “have always supported the people of Pakistan in calamities and natural disasters”, it expressed their resolve to extend all-out support to people affected by the recent floods.
Referring to the calamity, it said the Defence Day would be observed with “utmost humility”.
The statement further read: “Today, we reaffirm our pledge to uphold the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by the nation. Pakistan’s armed forces remain ever vigilant and prepared to defend the country against all kinds of threats. Any attempt to disrupt our hard-earned peace will be met with a befitting and decisive response.”
Messages from political leadership
In separate messages ahead of Sept 6, PM Shehbaz and President Zardari reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, countering external threats, and building a united, prosperous future.
They also recalled the 1965 War with India, noting that Pakistan’s valiant armed forces, with the full support of the people, had thwarted enemy aggression, proving that the country possesses the will and capacity to defend its independence and integrity.
Highlighting the recent Oper­ation Bunyanum Marsoos, Marka-i-Haq, PM Shehbaz lauded the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force for their unmatched professionalism and combat skills under the strategic leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace and constructive international engagement but war­ned against ignoring the reality of continuous Indian provocations and shifting regional dynamics.
Expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir, the prime minister reiterated unwavering support for their struggle for self-determination, stressing that it cannot be suppressed by force.
He also strongly condemned ongoing Israeli aggression in Palestine and urged the international community to ensure the protection of civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza.
In a separate message posted on X today, the premier said Pakistan’s policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world, as well as the nation’s commitment to strengthening and modernising defence capabilities.
He asserted that Pakistan remained committed to the policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world.
“Yet, we cannot be oblivious to the reality of persistent Indian provocations and the changing regional environment. We shall continue to strengthen and modernise our defence capabilities, while also confronting the twin menace of state-sponsored terrorism and foreign proxies operating within our borders,” he added.
 






Earlier, President Zardari, in his message, paid tribute to the valiant sacrifices of the nation’s armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to its defence and sovereignty.
He described September 6 as a glorious chapter in the country’s history and emphasised that the spirit of sacrifice from the 1965 War continued to serve as a guiding light for future generations.
The president highlighted the significance of this year’s Defence Day in light of the recent Operation Bunyanum Marsoos conducted in May 2025 against India.
“Just as our courageous forces demonstrated extraordinary valour and dedication in 1965, our sons once again proved their unmatched bravery during this year’s operation,” he said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Sept 6 was a “historic day of courage and bravery, when the martyrs, the veterans and the nation together made Pakistan invincible”.
Naqvi said that from Kasur to Lahore and from Sialkot to Kashmir, the Pakistan Army had given a “befitting response to the enemy at every front with unmatched courage and unwavering resolve”.
He underscored that Sept 6 was the renewal of the pledge that the country’s sanctity would never be compromised.
 






In his message today, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari posted on X that on Defence Day, “we honour our martyrs, their families, our ghazis, and the resilient people of Pakistan whose sacrifices shaped our destiny.”
He added, “Our people have stood the test of time, weathering aggression, terrorism, and calamities with courage and integrity. This legacy of sacrifice and resilience continues to guide our unity and confidence in Pakistan’s future.”

Muslims around the world celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), known in Arabic as the Mawlid al-Nabawi holiday, on the 12th of Rabiul Awwal — the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The nation also celebrated Defence Day today with the two events coinciding on the same date.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported that the day — a public holiday announced by the government — began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and a 21-gun salute in all provincial capitals.
It added that special prayers were also offered after the Fajr prayer for the unity of the Muslim world and Pakistan’s progress and prosperity.
 






The people celebrated the day with religious fervour and devotion, as mosques, streets, and public spaces across the country were adorned with colourful lights, green flags and decorations.
 


Special prayers, Seerat conferences and processions were held to mark the birth anniversary of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) with citizens participating in large numbers to pay tribute.
Markets and neighbourhoods glowed with festive lighting, and vendors displayed stalls offering badges, banners, and flags to mark the occasion. Community events, including food distribution and gatherings, were also organised nationwide.
 


 


The federal and provincial governments had made special arrangements to ensure peaceful and smooth observance of the occasion, with security and facilitation measures in place for devotees.
Religious leaders, scholars and government representatives at the 50th International Seerat-un-Nabi Conference also emphasised the need for responsible use of social media in line with Islamic teachings, while reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with the people of Palestine and occupied Kashmir.
The conference, organised by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony at the Convention Centre, was held under the theme ‘State’s Responsibilities in Educating for the Beneficial Use of Social Media in the Light of Holy Prophet’s Life (Peace Be Upon Him)’.
PM Shehbaz vows to rebuild Pakistan on principles of Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) life
In his message for the day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called upon the nation to renew its commitment to build Pakistan in line with the teachings of the life of the Holy Prophet, emphasising unity, justice, compassion and peace.
He noted that this year, Pakistan and Muslims around the world were celebrating the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) 1,500th birth anniversary.
“This historic milestone is being observed in accordance with the resolutions passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate, reflecting a collective national resolve to make the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings an integral part of the country’s Constitution, legal framework and public life,” he added.
“The life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) is a complete and comprehensive model for all aspects of life governance, justice, economics, trade, and social values,“ the prime minister said.
He stressed that the youth must be taught to embrace the eternal values of morality, kindness and truth as taught by the Holy Prophet and become ambassadors of his message of love, peace, and brotherhood.
PM Shehbaz underscored that the real strength of Pakistan lay in unity, tolerance and inclusivity.
“To overcome the challenges facing our nation, be they economic or social, we must integrate the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings into our national character,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz also called for rejecting all forms of prejudice, sectarianism, extremism and hatred, and instead promoting empathy, solidarity, and harmony among all citizens.
The premier urged every Pakistani to reaffirm their pledge to establish Pakistan as a true Islamic welfare state based on the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) model of compassion, social justice and equality.
He said the government’s core priorities include eradicating poverty, promoting education and research, and ensuring equal opportunity for all.
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari greeted the entire nation and Muslim world on the day of 1212 Rabiul Awwal and urged the people to pledge to mould individual and collective lives in accordance with the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings.
“This historic and memorable occasion is a source of joy and devotion for the Muslim ummah,” he said adding, “Besides this 12 Rabiul Awwal, the joy of completing the 1,500th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) brings us the message that we should implement the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) universal principles of justice, mercy, brotherhood and peace in our social, political and cultural structures.“
He added that the day “unites Muslims all over the world in a relationship that is based on faith and whose focus is solely and exclusively the noble personality” of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).
President Zardari said the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) taught that justice, fairness, compassion, kindness, brotherhood, equality and respect for humanity were the foundations of a pious society.
“Today, when the world is faced with challenges such as extremism, injustice, social unrest, and uncontrolled trends of digitalisation, we need to find solutions to these problems in the light of the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH),” he stressed.
“The solutions to the challenges that the Muslim ummah and Pakistan are facing today lie in the teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). He taught us unity, love, and brotherhood, and these are the principles that can take us out of social and economic problems. Let us take this opportunity to pledge that we will put our differences behind us and work together for the development of our country and nation.
“The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always taught us to help the weak, orphans, and the needy,” he continued, adding, “It is our responsibility to adopt the examples set by the Holy Prophet (PBUH).“
Addressing the current issues arising from the effects of climate change, he said joint efforts were being made by the government, local administration and relief organisations to ensure the safety and rehabilitation of the affected as early as possible.
“This is the time when we, while learning from Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), should help our people with open hearts and ensure their rehabilitation as soon as possible, because Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) also strived for the welfare of others in every situation,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-06 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06191433ed04082.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940199/us-navy-seals-botched-secret-2019-mission-in-north-korea-report' target='_blank'><strong>US Navy SEALs botched secret 2019 mission in North Korea: report</strong></a><br><p>Elite United States Navy SEALs launched an audacious operation in 2019 to plant a listening device in North Korea to spy on the country’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong Un, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Friday, but the mission quickly unravelled and culminated in the deaths of multiple civilians.
The operation came in the first administration of US President Donald Trump during sensitive nuclear talks with Kim, whom the US leader met three times.
The mission was considered so risky that it required direct presidential approval, the NYT said, but Trump insisted on Friday he had no knowledge of the operation.
“I don’t know anything about it. I’m hearing it now for the first time,” the president told journalists.
Despite months of practice, the mission still went horribly wrong, the *
NYT* reported.
The SEALs — from the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 — approached North Korea in mini-submarines that exposed them to frigid water for hours, then swam ashore, according to the newspaper, which interviewed two dozen people to piece together the account.
The special forces personnel thought they were alone, but didn’t see a small boat in the area. The boat later approached the mini-subs, with the crew carrying flashlights. One person jumped into the water.
Thinking the mission was compromised, the senior enlisted SEAL ashore opened fire on the boat, as did the others with him. When they reached the boat, they found two or three bodies, but no guns or uniforms: the dead were apparently civilians who were diving for shellfish.
The SEALs used knives to puncture the lungs of the boat’s crew so the bodies would sink, and were able to escape unharmed.
The NYT said the operation prompted a series of military reviews that found the killings were justified. The results of the reviews were classified, and key congressional leaders were kept in the dark.
While the failed mission did not create a major international crisis, it easily could have, and the incident highlights both the impunity and secrecy under which America’s elite forces operate around the globe.</p><small>2025-09-06 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061657015dfc9f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940184/pakistan-to-witness-lunar-eclipse-tomorrow-night-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to witness lunar eclipse tomorrow night: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible over Pakistan on the night of September 7 (Sunday), according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
“This is a great chance for people, especially students and astronomy enthusiasts, to connect with science and explore the wonders of our universe,” a Suparco spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “blood moon”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.</p><small>2025-09-06 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622243-heroes-of-marka-e-haq-recount-days-under-fire-at-loc' target='_blank'><strong>Heroes of Marka-e-Haq recount days under fire at LoC</strong></a><br><p>

In a press release, the PCB said that Pakistan’s new cycle of the ICC World Test Championship will begin with this visit by the Proteas, with the first test starting on October 12 in Lahore.
“The first Test will be played at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from October 12-16, which will also be the first five-day match at the stadium since its complete renovation earlier this year to host the ICC Champions Trophy 2025,” the PCB stated. “The second Test match is scheduled to take place at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from October 20-24.”
According to the press release, this will be the visitors’ first tour to Pakistan since 2021, where they lost a test series 2-0.
 






“At the conclusion of the red-ball matches, both sides will feature in three T20Is from October 28 to November 1, with the first T20I taking place at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, while the remaining two T20Is will be hosted at the Gaddafi Stadium,” the press release read.
“The series will conclude with three ODIs taking place from 4 to 8 November at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad.”
The PCB stated that this will be the first ODI played at Iqbal Stadium in 17 years, with the last match having been held on April 11, 2008, when Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets.
PCB Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said that he was looking forward to hosting South Africa, adding that hosting the World Test Champions “will provide quality cricket for our players and fans”.
“The return of ODI cricket to Faisalabad after 17 years is a special moment,“ he was quoted as saying in the press release. Iqbal Stadium holds a proud place in our cricketing history and we are excited to bring international cricket back to this part of the country.”
Pakistan is currently participating in a tri-series tournament with Afghanistan and hosts the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they reached the finals by defeating the hosts by 31 runs.
The tournament precedes the Asia Cup 2025 — also held in the UAE from September 9 to 28 — where the Green Shirts are expected to clash with arch-rivals India.</p><small>2025-09-06 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061402099e9d859.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940163/trump-signs-order-offering-some-tariff-exemptions-to-countries-with-us-trade-deals' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order offering some tariff exemptions to countries with US trade deals</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump signed an executive order offering some tariff exemptions as soon as Monday to trading partners who strike deals on industrial exports such as nickel, gold and other metals, as well as pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals.
Trump has spent his first seven months in office building up massive tariff increases to reorder the global trading system, cut US trade deficits and extract concessions from trading partner countries in negotiations.
His latest order identifies more than 45 categories for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who clinch framework pacts to cut Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security statute.
Friday’s order brings US tariffs in line with its commitments in existing framework deals, including those with allies such as Japan and the European Union.
The exemptions for countries with US trade deals are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT/0401 GMT on Monday, it said.
Pakistan is also among the countries that have signed trade deals with the US. Islamabad successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a deal with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
However, it is not clear yet that whether Pakistan would benefit from Trump’s latest order or not.
In the order, Trump says his willingness to reduce tariffs depends on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and US national interests.
The cuts cover items that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or produced in sufficient volume to meet domestic demand.
A White House official said it also creates new carveouts for some agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceuticals.
In situations where a country has struck a “reciprocal” trade deal with the United States, this will allow the US Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and customs to waive tariffs on covered imports without a new executive order from Trump, the official said.
The zero-tariff items identified in the order include graphite and various forms of nickel, a key ingredient in stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries.
Also covered are compounds used in generic pharmaceuticals, including the anesthetic lidocaine and reagents used in medical diagnostic tests.
The order encompasses various types of gold imports, from powders and leaf to bullion, a key import from Switzerland, which is struggling with US tariffs of 39 per cent as it has not yet reached a trade deal.
The order also permits tariffs to be scrapped on natural graphite, neodymium magnets, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and eliminates previous tariff exemptions on certain plastics and polysilicon, a key component of solar panels.</p><small>2025-09-06 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06145523b5a1ef7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940167/thailands-next-pm-reaffirms-fresh-polls-promise' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s next PM reaffirms fresh polls promise</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s next prime minister on Saturday pledged to make good on his promise to lead the fractured interim government to new polls.
Conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul was confirmed by parliament on Friday, ending a week-long power vacuum following the ouster of his predecessor Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
The construction magnate cobbled together a coalition of opposition blocs to shut out Pheu Thai, the electoral vehicle of the once-dominant Shinawatra dynasty’s patriarch Thaksin.
Anutin received the backing of the People’s Party, which holds a plurality of seats, on conditions that he recommitted to on Saturday.
“I think we are clear in terms of politics that we are going to dissolve the parliament in four months,” he said during a meeting at his party headquarters broadcast by Thai media.
“I will try to form my cabinet as soon as possible,” he said, adding that the foreign minister and energy minister were already confirmed.
Thaksin unexpectedly left the kingdom before the parliamentary vote, bound for Dubai where he said he would visit friends and seek medical treatment.
The Supreme Court is due to rule on Tuesday in a case over a hospital stay following his return from exile in August 2023, a verdict some analysts say could see him jailed.
“There will be no favouritism, no persecution, and no revenge,” Anutin told journalists on Friday.
Anutin’s right-wing Bhumjaithai party went into coalition with Pheu Thai in 2023, but pulled out in June over Paetongtarn’s alleged misconduct in a leaked phone call with Cambodian ex-leader Hun Sen.
The Shinawatras have been a mainstay of Thai politics for the past two decades, sparring with the pro-monarchy, pro-military establishment that views them as a threat to the kingdom’s traditional social order.
But they have faced a series of setbacks, including Paetongtarn’s removal last week.
Anutin previously served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister, but is perhaps most famous for delivering on a promise to decriminalise cannabis in 2022.
His elevation to the premiership still needs to be endorsed by Thailand’s king to become official.</p><small>2025-09-06 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06094904e4e02a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940066/sales-of-byd-cars-cross-2000-in-six-months' target='_blank'><strong>Sales of BYD cars cross 2,000 in six months</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Hub Power Company (Hubco) has disclosed that BYD has sold over 2,000 cars in less than six months, while more than 500 orders have already been placed for its Shark model. The company is currently importing completely built units (CBUs) under the normal duty regime.
Hubco is setting up a completely knocked down (CKD) assembly plant in Gharo with an annual production capacity of 25,000 units.
According to a report by Asad Ali of Topline Securities, based on the company’s analyst briefing, financial close is expected in the last quarter of 2025. The project carries an estimated cost of $150 million, structured on a 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio.
 
 

Both foreign and local lenders are on board, with a term sheet already signed. Hubco expects CKD production to begin within 24 months.
Regarding ownership, the company clarified that the project is a 50:50 joint venture between Hub Power Holding — a wholly owned Hubco subsidiary — and Mega Conglomerate.
BYD has not taken an equity stake in the venture. Globally, BYD has pursued 100pc ownership in markets such as Thailand and Brazil, making this its first global partnership without equity participation.
On EV charging, the company noted that while chargers were initially sourced from Europe, Chinese suppliers have now made them more affordable. It added that EV charging stations become financially viable with usage of three cars per day.
Hubco plans to install chargers every 150-200 kilometres along the Karachi-Peshawar motorway over the next six months.
Separately, Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd plans to roll out CKD models of the TANK-500 and CANNON plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) by March 31, 2026. The company had earlier launched its first CKD PHEV — the Haval H6 1.5L — on Aug 16, 2025, according to its FY25 annual report.

In a statement shared on X, the telecom giant said the submarine cable cuts near Saudi capital Jeddah had impacted the partial bandwidth capacity SMW4 (South Asia-Middle East-West Asia) and IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe) networks.
“Internet users in Pakistan may experience some service degradation during peak hours,” the PTCL statement read. “Our international partners are working on priority to resolve the issue while our local teams are actively arranging alternative bandwidth to minimise the impact.”
 






The Ministry of Information Technology has not issued any statement on the development yet.
This is not the first time that damage to undersea internet cables has affected services in Pakistan.
Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024. On January 3 this year, PTCL said teams were “diligently” working to resolve the matter of disruptions faced by users after a fault in the AAE-1 subsea internet cable connecting Pakistan slowed down the network speed in the country.
On January 16, PTCL announced that internet services were “now fully operational” after the complete restoration of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 (AAE-1) undersea internet cable.</p><small>2025-09-06 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622229-in-pictures-streets-shine-bright-across-country-on-eid-milad-un-nabi-pbuh' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Streets shine bright across country on Eid Milad un Nabi (PBUH)</strong></a><br><p>

The exchange comes amid strains after Washington imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian imports, accusing New Dehli of fuelling Moscow’s deadly attacks on Ukraine by purchasing Russian oil.
But Trump and Modi, both right-wing populists, have shared a strong bond since the US president’s first term.
“Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties,” Modi wrote on X, adding that India and the United States shared a “very positive and forward-looking comprehensive and global strategic partnership”.
 






Earlier, Trump told reporters that he “will always be friends with Modi”.
“India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about,” Trump said, downplaying his earlier remarks about “losing India” to China.
Last week, Modi visited China to attend a gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, his first visit to the country in seven years signalling a thaw between the two Asian powers.
Trump has appeared irritated at New Delhi as he seeks credit for what he said was Nobel Prize-worthy diplomacy for brokering peace between Pakistan and India following the worst conflict in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
India, which adamantly rejects any third-party mediation on the Kashmir issue, has since given the cold shoulder to Trump.</p><small>2025-09-06 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061027337d2c592.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940140/alcaraz-downs-djokovic-to-set-up-blockbuster-us-open-final-with-sinner' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz downs Djokovic to set up blockbuster US Open final with Sinner</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz overpowered Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Friday to set up a blockbuster US Open final showdown against world number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner.
Spanish second seed Alcaraz produced a ruthlessly efficient display to end Djokovic’s latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam title, winning 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in two hours and 23 minutes.
Alcaraz was then followed into the final by arch-rival Sinner, who was forced to work hard by Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime before wrapping up a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.
It means that Alcaraz and Sinner will collide in a third consecutive Grand Slam final this year on Sunday, where United States President Donald Trump will be among a 23,000 crowd to watch the latest instalment of the gripping “Sincaraz” rivalry.
Alcaraz won the duo’s first meeting in an epic five-hour 29-minute tussle at the French Open in June before Sinner dethroned the Spaniard in the final at Wimbledon the following month.
Alcaraz’s victory over Djokovic suggested though that he is more than capable of ambushing Sinner in a match where the winner will be assured of the world number one ranking on Monday.

‘Beating Novak is special’
The 22-year-old five-time Grand Slam winner has not dropped a set en route to the final but still believes he has room for improvement.
“Beating Novak is always special. But I don’t feel like I’ve won anything more than a Grand Slam semi-final,” Alcaraz said after downing the 38-year-old Djokovic.
“It was an important match, but it was just a ticket to the final.”
Djokovic said he plans to chase more Grand Slams next year, but admitted he was no longer physically capable of matching Alcaraz and Sinner.
“I’m happy with my level of tennis, but you know, it’s just the physicality of it,” Djokovic said after his exit. “That’s something I, unfortunately at this point in time in my career, can’t control.”
 


Sinner meanwhile appeared to be readying another quickfire win as he sprinted through the opening set of his clash with the rangy Auger-Aliassime.
But the Canadian leveled by taking the second set only for Sinner to respond to claim the next two and a return to the final.
‘An amazing season’
Sinner, who also won the Australian Open in January, is now only the fourth man in history to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams in a single season, joining an exclusive club whose other members are Rod Laver, Roger Federer and Djokovic.
“It’s been an amazing season. The Grand Slams are the most important tournaments we have throughout the year,” Sinner said.
The Italian’s date with Alcaraz is also a rematch of their famous 2022 US Open quarter-final five-setter, which finished at around 2:50am and remains the latest finish in tournament history.
“Sunday is a very special day and an amazing final again. I feel like our rivalry started here playing an amazing match,” Sinner said in a nod to their 2022 classic.
“We are two different players now, with different confidence too. Let’s see what’s coming. We’ve played each other a lot, we know each other very well.”

Sunday’s final meanwhile will have a rare visit from a sitting US President after confirmation earlier on Friday that Trump plans to attend the tennis showpiece.
Trump’s visit, confirmed to AFP by a White House official, is the latest appearance by the US leader at a major sporting event following trips to the Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
“For me, playing in front of him… I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump’s presence. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president (at) the final.”
Today, the women’s singles final will be decided when defending champion and world number Aryna Sabalenka faces American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova.
In the women’s doubles final on Friday, Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe won their second US Open women’s doubles title in three years after beating Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-4, 6-4.</p><small>2025-09-06 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05200834180856a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939976/justice-shah-asks-cjp-afridi-to-publicly-answer-6-questions-on-pressing-institutional-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Shah asks CJP Afridi to publicly answer 6 questions on ‘pressing institutional concerns’</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah has written a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi asking him to publicly answer six questions regarding “pressing institutional concerns”, it emerged on Friday.
In a letter dated Thursday, seen by Dawn.com, Justice Shah said he was reluctantly writing it in “discharge of an unavoidable institutional duty”, adding that what compelled him was “your (CJP’s) persistent and complete indifference”.
The judge wrote that his “repeated letters and written communications to you (CJP) on the undermentioned issues have gone unanswered and undiscussed; not once have I received a reply-neither in writing nor verbally”, adding that such silence from the chief justice to the senior puisne judge was “not merely discourteous; it undermines the collegial traditions of this court and violates the institutional courtesy without which a constitutional court cannot function”.
Justice Shah said that with the new judicial year commencing from Monday, CJP Afridi had convened a judicial conference to review the reforms undertaken under his leadership and to lay down priority areas for the coming year.
“It is therefore both timely and opportune that the institutional concerns I raise in this letter be addressed squarely by you in that forum. By doing so, you will not only respond to the questions that remain unanswered but also reassure the judges of this court, the bar and the public we serve that your vision of reform is grounded in collegiality, transparency, and fidelity to the Constitution.”
The questions the judge asked the CJP to answer were:

Why has the Practice and Procedure Act Committee never been convened
to carry out its statutory responsibilities?
Why was the revision of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 approved by circulation rather than after discussion and deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was the policy on releasing dissenting opinions adopted by soliciting individual opinions of the judges — saying it was a process “unheard of” — rather than an open deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was a General Standing Order (GSO) on leave issued that subjects judges to controls inconsistent with judicial independence and the Presidential Order of 1997?
Why have the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment not been fixed before the original Full Court?
If CJP Afridi was nurturing independence among judges or “enforcing compliance to turn this court into a regimented force rather than a constitutional court of free and equal judges?”

Justice Shah said the letter must not be construed as a “personal grievance”.
“The concerns I now raise do not come from indolence or neglect, but from a judge who has consistently and conscientiously performed his duty. They are, therefore, institutional concerns borne of experience and responsibility rather than personal complaint,” he explained.
Justice Shah said that he trusted CJP Afridi to use the judicial conference as a “moment of institutional renewal by answering these questions and reaffirming the principles of collegiality and constitutional fidelity”.
Justice Shah said the questions were those that struck at the “heart of independence” and not only the apex court judges, but also the nation, were looking towards CJP Afridi “not for silence but for clarity”.
Concerns about PaPA Committee
Elaborating on his questions, Justice Shah said the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, was enacted by the apex court to put an end to the “one-man show” in the formation of benches.
He pointed out that it required that all causes, matters, petitions, appeals or reviews be placed before benches constituted by a committee under the act, adding that its purpose was “clear”: to review pending cases, devise a transparent case-management plan, categorise cases intelligently and allocate them to benches through collective deliberation.
“Yet, since your assumption of office in October 2024, not a single official meeting of the PaPA Committee has been convened. Bench formation and cause lists are being issued unilaterally, without any committee deliberation. Rosters are circulated for signatures, expecting members to endorse them blindly without discussion of case allocation or categorisation. As a senior member of the committee, I have had no opportunity to participate in its work as mandated by law.
“This is a direct violation of the act and raises serious concerns. Why are junior judges regularly assigned to three-member benches while senior judges are confined to two-member benches? Why are matters of national importance with far-reaching policy implications not fixed before senior benches? The pattern suggests that independent judges are being sidelined, not for reasons of efficiency, but for reasons of control.”
Justice Shah said that minutes of five “committee meetings” displayed on the court’s website could not “cure this defect”, arguing that “they were not committee meetings within the meaning of the act but mere discussions about the chief justice’s travel schedule. Even then, their minutes were uploaded in violation of a binding majority decision of the committee. I had recorded my dissent on that occasion, arguing for transparency, but it was disregarded. This is symptomatic of a mindset averse to collegiality and inclined towards dictation.”
 
 

The judge rued that “the genie of the ‘one-man show’, which Parliament sought to bury through legislation, has been released once again”, adding that that was the reason why he had ceased signing the rosters circulated without any meeting.
“By sidelining the committee and withholding even basic information (such as the number of cases to be dealt with or those fixed before larger benches), you have reduced a statutory mechanism of collective decision-making into a façade.
“The result is evident: despite the increase in the number of judges, the court’s pendency remains at 57,455 cases. The very purpose of enhancing the court’s strength — reducing backlog — stands defeated. The unavoidable inference is that enlargement of the court was less about addressing pendency and more about altering its internal balance, thereby diluting the independence and standing of existing judges.”
Revision of court rules
Regarding the revision of the apex court’s rules, Justice Shah said they were a constitutional document that governed the institution’s functioning and their first revision in four decades was an event of “historic significance”.
He argued that such a process required a Full Court meeting on the administrative side. “Instead, you chose to approve the draft rules by circulation — a process suited to routine matters, not to reshaping the court’s constitutional framework.
“By avoiding deliberation, you deprived the court of collective wisdom and diminished judicial dialogue. This course reflects a lack of collegiality and a preference for unilateral authority.”
Policy on dissenting opinions
Regarding dissenting opinions, Justice Shah said the court’s recent policy on releasing them with the majority judgment was approved through a unique process of soliciting the views of individual judges by the registrar.
He said there was no “legal or institutional basis for individual opinion-gathering on such critical matters”, unless specifically authorised by the Full Court, and even then, only for matters that were procedural or minor in nature.
Justice Shah said the above exercise could not be treated as a substitute for Full Court deliberation, nor could responses to this letter be used to formulate policy in isolation.
“A matter of jurisprudential weight was reduced to a secretive tick-box exercise and the court was denied the richness of open deliberation.
“A Full Court meeting is not merely a procedural formality — it is the bedrock of judicial collegiality. It allows all judges of this court to come together, to deliberate, to exchange ideas and, through open dialogue, to persuade or be persuaded. In such a forum, a judge may revise or refine their view after hearing their colleagues, or may help develop a collective wisdom that is far more robust than isolated responses. This essential element of judicial democracy is entirely lost when opinions are sought in writing and in silos.”
General Standing Order on leave
Justice Shah said that the GSO dated July 29, 2025, was the “first time” in the court’s history that something had dictated that judges were “whole-time” at the state’s disposal, adding that this was language “wholly alien” to a constitutional court.
“Judges are not regimented officers; their independence is constitutionally entrenched.”
The judge said the GSO had confined foreign leaves to five categories, but this was a restriction not envisaged in Presidential Order No. 2 of 1997.
“In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it. Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums. Such arbitrary denials betray a deep institutional insecurity.”
Justice Shah further railed that the newly introduced requirement under the GSO that a judge must disclose his residential address and contact details was “alien” to the practice of constitutional courts worldwide.
“It borrows from the ethos of civil-service bureaucracy and attempts to transplant it into the judiciary, with deeply corrosive consequences. A judge of this court is not a supervised functionary of the state but a constitutional actor whose independence is both decisional and personal. To compel disclosure of a judge’s private residence is not administration — it is surveillance. It reduces the dignity of the office to that of a monitored employee and cloaks an instrument of control in the garb of procedure.
“No constitutional court of repute — the US Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, or the Constitutional Court of South Africa — has ever imposed such a condition. You may not realise it, but by imposing it here, you are striking at the very independence of this court. A judiciary under watch ceases to be a judiciary; it becomes an extension of bureaucracy. Kindly note that no apex court of repute across jurisdictions mandates such disclosure, precisely because the ethos of independence demands institutional courtesy, not surveillance.”
The senior puisne judge pointed out that the GSO had been “weaponised to create a judicial ‘exit control list’”.
He noted that leave was no longer a matter of “respect and consultation but of bureaucratic obstruction”, adding that it was an “authoritarian impulse that undermines judicial independence”.
The judge further pointed out that “disturbingly, these rigid policies bear the imprint of the civil bureaucracy. The registrar — a retired civil servant — appears to be driving an agenda alien to the ethos of a constitutional court. Judges are not governed by the logic of command and control but by independence and collegiality. Judges are not mere agents of government; they are guardians of the people’s liberties.”
Supreme Court’s legitimacy
Lastly, Justice Shah said the apex court and CJP Afridi’s legitimacy “hangs in the balance” in the pending petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
He pointed out that the petitions remained unheard for nearly a year, though they concerned the Supreme Court’s independence.
“They must be heard by the original Full Court, excluding judges elevated after the amendment. Until then, any initiative under your leadership remains institutionally fragile, for its foundation is constitutionally suspect. True leadership lies not in managing compliance but in ensuring that the court rises above suspicion as the fearless guardian of the Constitution,” the senior puisne judge concluded.</p><small>2025-09-06 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06021403f355615.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939991/can-icc-use-indias-own-policy-to-revive-pakistan-india-tests' target='_blank'><strong>Can ICC use India’s own policy to revive Pakistan-India Tests?</strong></a><br><p>DUBAI: Could the Indian government’s own sports policy hold the key to reviving the most watched, most lucrative and most emotionally charged rivalry in Test cricket — Pakistan versus India?
Upon reviewing India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports’ policy on international events, a key clause stands out: “Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India.”
Another important line states: “About international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons.”
Taken together, the policy is clear: bilateral series remain off-limits, but participation in international and multilateral events is allowed, and India defers to the practices of international sports bodies — in this case, the International Cricket Council (ICC).
This is why the two sides still face each other in ICC World Cups, ICC Champions Trophy, and ACC Asia Cups. So why not in the ICC World Test Championship (WTC)?
Currently, the ICC WTC league stage is organised on a bilateral basis, with each of the nine participants choosing six opponents over the two-year cycle — three at home and three away — subject to agreement between boards. Each board arranges fixtures, hosts matches and retains all revenues. The ICC’s role is limited to providing the points system, playing conditions, rules, branding and appointing match and anti-corruption officials.
While this flexibility gives members freedom to shape their calendars, it also means India can simply omit Pakistan from its selection, keeping the rivalry outside the Championship.
Because the ICC WTC fixtures are scheduled and commercialised bilaterally — even though they sit inside an ICC competition — India can contend these are not “multilateral” under its policy.
Unlike the ICC WTC final, the solution does not require the ICC to take over complete match operations or host revenues. The ICC should formally designate the WTC league stage as an ICC event for governance and compliance purposes — competition regulations, branding and non-negotiable fixture obligations — while leaving match operations and all host-board revenues untouched.
Once that happens, matches would not only be classified as ICC events but India’s sports policy would apply, obliging participation. Also, host boards will continue to stage matches and retain revenues while the the ICC enforces compliance and safeguards the competition.
India’s policy — which explicitly defers to international sports bodies — places the onus on the ICC. If the ICC defines the WTC as a true multilateral event, India would be obliged under its own stated policy to participate, including fixtures against Pakistan. Ownership here is administrative and legal, not operational or financial.
The absence of India-Pakistan Tests has left the ICC WTC lopsided and deprived the format of its most compelling contest. A revival would not only balance the competition but also electrify the Championship for fans; in turn, lifting global viewership and sponsorship. Moreover, it will give players a stage to compete in the traditional format and strengthen the ICC’s credibility and reputation in protecting and promoting Test cricket.
The precedent already exists. The Ashes is protected within every ICC WTC cycle, guaranteeing that Australia and England meet home and away regardless of scheduling pressures. There is no structural reason why the same principle could not apply to India and Pakistan once the WTC is elevated to a fully recognised ICC event.
Some will argue that politics, not policy, has always dictated whether India and Pakistan play. True — but the same policy also states that India will take part in international events that include Pakistan. Once the ICC WTC league is formally designated as an ICC event with non-negotiable fixtures, the default is participation; any deviation would require an explicit policy exception rather than ambiguity.
Series logistics are manageable, even if at present the environment is not conducive for the two to host each other. Neutral venues such as the UAE or England have successfully hosted both nations, and several boards have publicly expressed interest in staging Pakistan-India Tests.
The ICC has already branded, officiated and regulated the WTC. It does not need to organise or run matches — it simply needs to make the league stage a fully recognised ICC event under its authority.
Every ICC leader has left a mark: David Richards started the ICC Champions Trophy (previously known as the ICC Knock-Out); Malcolm Speed launched the T20 World Cup; Haroon Lorgat introduced technology in world cricket; David Richardson standardised technology and planted the ICC WTC seed; and Geoff Allardice put wheels to the ICC WTC and spearheaded cricket’s return to the Olympics.
Sanjog Gupta, the ICC’s new Chief Executive, now has the chance to build his own legacy by ensuring the Pakistan-India Test rivalry is restored under ICC authority, without disrupting host boards’ operations or revenues.
The bottom line remains that India and Pakistan haven’t played a Test since the 2007 three-match series in India. However, if these two powerhouses of cricket can generate millions in revenue by playing in ICC-organised ODIs and T20Is, there is no logical reason to deny them a Test series — the game’s purest format.
The ICC World Test Championship is the perfect stage to finally deliver the ultimate India-Pakistan series. To secure the survival and growth of Test cricket, and protect the integrity of its marquee competition, the ICC must think boldly, own the WTC and act decisively.
