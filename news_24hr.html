The federal minister expressed these views in a meeting with Chinese ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong on Sunday.
The two sides discussed the progress of ongoing CPEC projects and preparations for the upcoming Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, where key decisions are expected to further stre­n­gthen bilateral relations.
Mr Iqbal said after the successful completion of the first phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC), the second phase focuses on industrial cooperation, agriculture, information technology, and social development.
He emphasised connecting CPEC to Central Asian states to boost regional economic stability and economic cooperation.
He said there exists vast potential for mineral exploration in and around Gwadar.
“With the development of modern infrastructure, its mineral resources can be fully capitalized,” he added.
The minister reiterated the government’s commitment to improving and ensuring the security of CPEC projects.
He also discussed continued collaboration with China in the agriculture sector and noted that agriculture graduates trained in China will play a vital role in helping Pakistan address impacts of climate change.
The minister also discussed establishment of Pakistan Space Centre and said China will play a pivotal role in ensuring the timely completion of this project of strategic importance.
Ambassador Jiang Zaidong reaffirmed China’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s development efforts. He assured that bilateral cooperation will continue to expand in the coming years.
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and senior officials from the two countries also attended the meeting.

A decision to this effect was taken last week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, which chose to keep secret the steep revision in charges, although it confirmed the rates had been revised.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), which tabled the proposal, the RBS spectrum and licence fees had remained unchanged since 2000 despite inflation rising by over 700pc in the same period.
Official record seen by Dawn suggests that a hike of about 361.3pc has been approved in RBS charges for 748 licensees of private radio networks to Rs350 million from Rs76m, an increase of Rs274m per licence.

PTA to collect Rs463m under revised fee structure

Likewise, a 300pc increase in RBS rates has been allowed for mobile stations used by a total of 144 licensees of aircraft and ships to Rs2.852m from Rs713,000, showing an increase of Rs2.139m per licence.
Similarly, the charges for licensees of 165 Amateur Radio, 17 Inmarsat and 19 Microwave DRS links have been doubled. The revised fee for Amateur Radio licences has increased from Rs160,000 to Rs320,000 per licence. Inmarsat licence charges have risen from Rs625,000 to Rs1.25m, while the fee for Microwave DRS links has been raised from Rs53.92m to Rs107.84m.
The PTA estimates that the increase in service charges would increase its revenue to about Rs463m from the existing Rs131.4m, an increase of 252pc or Rs331.44m.
The increase in RBS rates in terms of foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been estimated to actually drop by 18pc to $1.66m per year from the existing revenue of $2.021m.
Informed sources said the ECC expressed displeasure at the fact that relevant stakeholders, including PTA and the Ministry of IT and Telecom, had been sleeping over the issue for two and a half decades.
The ECC “directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector”, an official statement said.
The PTA is responsible for frequency allocation, licence issuance and fee adjustments for RBS services, including PRNs, Mobile Station Aircraft/Ship, Inmarsat, Amateur, and DRS/Microwave links.
The Ministry of IT and Telecom informed the ECC that the outdated fee structure had led to a significant mismatch between service charges and the costs incurred in managing licences and spectrum oversight.
It said the economic landscape had undergone a significant transformation since the implementation of the previous fee structure. Further, the monetary value and technological sophistication of services rendered through RBS licences and authorisations also increased substantially, driven by technological advancements and the evolving requirements of contemporary communication systems.
This significant evolution in both economic parameters and service delivery frameworks required an immediate and comprehensive revision of the RBS fee structure.
Under Sections 5(2a), 5(2c) and 43(5) of the Pakistan Tele-communication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996, the PTA is mandated to regulate the issuance and renewal of licences, the processing of frequency assignment requests and the charging of relevant fees.
Moreover, Clause 8.7.5 of the Telecommunication Policy 2015 mandated the PTA to propose to the federal government the methods of assigning and pricing frequency spectrum after consultation with stakeholders. Based on an industry consultation in August 2024, the PTA then proposed a revision in the RBS fee structure.

The satellite, developed by Suparco, is designed to provide early warnings for natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides, while also supporting crop assessment and urban planning.
“This marks a significant step in Pakistan’s space and scientific development,” Suparco said in a statement, adding that the satellite will “enhance our ability to respond to disasters and improve food security and environmental monitoring.”
The launch comes amid a deepening partnership between Islam­abad and Beijing in space science.
In May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.
One of the astronauts is expected to join a future mission aboard China’s Tiangong Space Station as a scientific payload specialist.
In January, Pakistan launched its first home-made observation satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China, Pakistan’s space agency said.
The PRSC-EO1 satellite aimed to boost Pakistan’s ability to monitor and manage natural resources, respond to disasters, and improve urban planning and agricultural development
In November last year, Suparco announced its rover will join China’s Chang’E 8 mission to the moon’s south pole in 2028—a move hailed as a “significant milestone” for the country.
Officials say these initiatives underscore Pakistan’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development and disaster preparedness, as the country seeks to build resilience against climate change and natural disasters.

They were potential recruits for the colonial armies. Though the British have long departed, echoes of this sentiment seem to have lingered through the century.
We are today a population of 241.5 million and a promise for more, with a growth rate of 2.55 per cent annually. Promising to some as a demographic dividend waiting to be harnessed, it also presents significant challenges. The youth bulge is striking; 26 per cent of the population is between 15 and 29, and over half (53.8pc) falls within the working-age group (15-59). The Economic Survey, 2025, interestingly highlights this demographic dynamic as a “unique opportunity”.
Also highlighted by the Survey are several initiatives by the government aimed at unlocking this potential. The National Vocational & Technical Training Commission, especially under the Prime Minister’s Youth Skill Development Programme, has trained tens of thousands of young people in emerging fields. Under the PMYSDP, a total of 72,362 have been trained especially in IT. Looking ahead, NAVTTC aims to train 100,000 youth in high-tech IT skills, another 100,000 in traditional trades, and 150,000 in industrial skills over the next three years. All these efforts combined aim to elevate our skilled workforce to close to half a million — 473,291, to be exact.
This number falls significantly short of the unemployment challenge. Youth unemployment, according to the 2023 Population and Housing Census, remains alarmingly high at 29pc among those aged 15-24. An additional 16m young people are neither employed nor in education — deemed ‘idle youth’ — peaking at 22.7m in 2023. Unemployment is especially severe in Balochistan and KP and in the rural areas.
With inadequate jobs in the market, poverty is certain to increase. A recent World Bank report raises serious concerns. Due to an upward revision of the poverty threshold, the poverty rate in Pakistan has jumped from 39.8pc to 44.7pc at a per-day income of $4.20. According to government estimates, using official data from the 2018-19 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, the poverty rate is 21.9pc. Recent research from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics suggests it could be as high as 39.5pc, with 70pc of people in Balochistan, 48pc in KP, 45pc percent in Sindh, and 30pc in Punjab suffering from poverty. Rural areas have higher poverty rates than urban areas.
Regardless of which figures we want to believe in, economic security is at risk.

We seem to know what to do. But what appears to be missing is political will.

Poverty’s toll is also visible in health metrics. Approximately 40pc of children under five are stunted — the highest in South Asia. Stunting, caused mainly by malnutrition, is known to stifle cognitive and physical development. Stunted children will become adults with lower levels of intelligence and with decreased capacity to earn, hampering productivity and long-term economic growth at the national level. We are thus creating a vicious cycle of economic deprivation, unemployment and underdevelopment.
The interconnection between economic deprivation and social unrest is complex. Scholars debate whether poverty directly fuels terrorism. Egyptian analyst Dr Hany Ali Nasira reviewed poverty rates of the countries which ranked the first six on the Global Terrorism Index for the years 2020 to 2023 and found a strong correlation between poverty and terrorism. He contends that, although there are other causes giving rise to terrorism — such as crises, political instability and sectarian disagreements, external support to terrorist groups and governance — terrorist groups often exploit economic grievances. They promise employment or financial gains, turning poverty into a fertile ground for recruitment.
Research from Punjab University also demonstrates that terrorism inflames uncertainty, deterring investments, foreign and domestic, deepening unemployment and poverty, and further fuelling a cycle of violence and underdevelopment. The deadly terrorist attacks in Balochistan and KP exemplify these dynamics, threatening national security. The findings suggest that terrorism both contributes to and is exacerbated by poverty, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that hinders economic development.
With our economic growth rate unable to keep pace with our increasing population, we need to address the challenge our ‘idle youth’ may pose to national security. The 2022-2026 National Security Policy, too, explicitly recognises population growth as a destabilising factor, particularly when intertwined with poverty, ethnic tensions and uneven development.
Almost all other large Muslim nations — Bangladesh, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia — have successfully implemented population reforms decades ago. It has helped them in maintaining their human development goals. While Pakistan ranks 168 out of 193 countries on the Human Development Index 2025, Bangladesh is at 130, Iran at 75 and Indonesia at 113, to mention a few. Yet, in Pakistan, the debate on population continues. An urgent sense of crisis remains elusive. Whether we adopt ‘family health’ or ‘tawazzun’ — balanced coexistence between population and available resource as guiding principles — we must act decisively.
Four years ago, an editorial in Dawn on July 11 (World Population Day) suggested a ‘population emergency’. More conferences were held, and more commitments made by government officials, on World Population Day this year. We seem to know what to do, also detailed in the paper published last November by the Population Council and UNFPA, titled Pakistan@2050: Demographic Change, Future Projections, and Development Opportunities.
What seems to be missing is the political will to ‘seize the moment’ advocated by Dr Zeba Sathar, country director of the Population Council in Dawn on the important ‘Day’ — another day remembered yet neglected.
Let us seize the moment lest the prayer in Punjab trails us into the next century. Let us seize the moment lest our own people become a challenge for our national security.

Published in Dawn, July 28th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-28 04:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6886cf50e473d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927092/return-of-hard-power' target='_blank'><strong>Return of hard power</strong></a><br><p>HARD power has returned with a vengeance to centre stage in geopolitics. Not that its importance ever diminished. That will not happen. Military force will remain a key power resource in international affairs. But there was hope that wars would be abjured as a means to settle inter-state differences and the use of force would be an option of last resort.
Dialogue and diplomacy, rather than military or economic coercion, would become the preferred policy choice for states. And soft power — the power of persuasion — would be utilised much more to pursue foreign policy goals and build a country’s global influence.
Not so today. Powerful countries and regional powers are using hard power to try to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force has become an option of first and not last resort for them, and the main way of ‘resolving’ disagreements and imposing their will. Israel’s war on Gaza, its attacks on Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force.
 
 

All these actions have defied international law and the legal prohibition on the use of force. They have been carried out with impunity, further fragmenting an already fraying global order and undermining multilateralism and systems of international cooperation. Global norms that de-emphasise the coercive use of hard power have been wilfully ignored by them in pursuit of their goals. This modern version of ‘gunboat diplomacy’ has seen the greater use or the threat of force to secure political and economic objectives. This is pushing the world towards a Hobbesian state of lawlessness.
The rising salience of hard power in international affairs is reflected in how countries, especially big powers, have been augmenting their hard power resources. The spike in global defence spending is evidence of this. It has reached a new high as countries big and small deem increasing their hard power assets to be essential to promoting their goals and secure themselves in an unstable international environment.

With use of military force and economic coercion dominating geopolitics does soft power still count?

The way economic coercion is being used by the Trump administration also testifies to the current surge in the exercise of hard power. President Donald Trump has imposed a trade war by slapping higher tariffs on almost every country in the world to extract concessions in negotiations conducted under the pressure of threats and punitive actions. The use of coercive economic power to browbeat countries has involved no distinction between allies and adversaries. All are being compelled to renegotiate trade deals, with tariffs used as a punitive hard power tool for economic gain. The signal sent by this approach is that noncompliance with US demands will entail a heavy cost. The consequence of this form of hyper-unilateralism is to upend not just the global trade order but also established norms of engagement between countries, with unknowns outpacing the knowns.
Does all this mean soft power has become less important or relevant? Is diplomacy devalued by the increased use of hard power? Is the practice of co-opting others rather than coercing them being discarded? Has the concept of soft power become dated, as some analysts claim? The short answer is no, as it remains an important component of international politics — a key tool in the arsenal of countries to build influence and shape perceptions. Therefore, despite the prevailing dominance of hard power, it would be a mistake to conclude that soft power, which is the ability to shape the preferences of others and achieve outcomes through ‘attraction’, no longer counts on the global stage.
In fact, while the US and other states are exercising hard power, China has increasingly been pursuing a soft power strategy, to complement the increase in its economic and military strength. This has helped it expand its global influence, build trust and secure greater cooperation from countries. Not surprisingly, it has shot to number two position among 193 countries in the latest global soft power index compiled by Brand Finance, the London-based consultancy firm. This is the result of its multifaceted economic, diplomatic and cultural strategy to boost its global image.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (with 150 participating countries), technological advances especially in AI, development assistance, investments in green technology and cultural diplomacy are all aspects of its vigorous and diverse soft power efforts. So is its active role in multilateral institutions as well as speaking for the Global South. Its proactive diplomacy, for example, in mediating the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has also enhanced its soft power appeal. All this has enabled China to increase its global influence and shape international perceptions to its advantage.
Joseph Nye, who introduced the notion of soft power decades ago, considered the question of whether soft power was still significant in today’s world. An insightful piece in the current issue of Foreign Affairs co-authored with Robert Keohane, written just before Nye passed away, argued that Trump, “inordinately committed to coercion”, did not understand soft power or its role in foreign policy, and relied only on deploying hard power. This was a losing strategy in the long run. This is because if a country is attractive “it won’t need to rely as much on incentives and penalties to shape the behaviour of others”.
Moreover “If allies see it as benign and trustworthy, they are more persuadable and likely to follow that country’s lead”. But if they see their trading partner as a bully, they are more likely to be reluctant partners and seek to reduce their long-term dependence. The authors also posit that in a world characterised by growing interdependence, securing cooperation is essential which soft power strategies are very effective at doing.
While the exercise of hard power seems to be the dominant global trend today, soft power continues to have its own place and value in international politics. This means that countries can advance their interests not just through military and economic strength but also by persuasion and attraction which encourages other states to cooperate and align with them. Soft assets cannot replace hard resources but can help states earn respect and trust, so essential for the successful promotion of national goals.

Speaking at a July 26 symposium, Justice Afridi described district courts as the “most precious jewel” of Pakistan’s judiciary. As the grassroots level of the justice system, they are often the first point of contact for citizens. This also means that they are the most overburdened component of the system. Perhaps this is why it was encouraging to see district courts being prioritised in the chief justice’s reform vision.
Recognising the emotional, psychological and institutional pressures faced by judges, particularly at the district level, the chief justice said he wished to place their well-being at the centre of his reform initiatives. At the same time, he spelt out the conduct he expected from district judges. They ought to be “diligent, disciplined, respectful, polite, humble and empathetic” towards citizens, so that “an aggrieved citizen may walk confidently into the court of a magistrate or a civil court in his own local town instead of being burdened to approach the high court or the Supreme Court for seeking redressal of his grievances”.
With respect to the superior judiciary, the chief justice seemed concerned about the allegations of extraneous pressure that have dogged the courts for the past many years. He said guidelines to protect judges from external pressures were being formulated for the higher courts, with the expectation that similar guidelines would also be introduced by the high courts at the district level.
He also proposed that the office of the chief justice of Pakistan should be involved in the response mechanism for “strong and unified institutional support”. These reform proposals seem well-intentioned, and the need for judicial independence has never been clearer. However, one would be amiss in not acknowledging the shadow of the 26th Amendment and the consequences it has entailed for the justice system.
At the moment, public faith in the judiciary appears to have hit a new low. The widespread perception is that the courts are unable to dispense justice without fear or favour. Every chief justice has, in recent years, attempted to reform their institution, but these efforts have failed to deliver a robust justice system for ordinary citizens.
While Chief Justice Afridi’s guidelines to counter extraneous influences are commendable, their success hinges on vigorous enforcement against powerful actors — a challenge past chief justices, too, could not fully surmount. Systemic issues like underfunding and staffing shortages also require government support, which seems to have turned increasingly conditional amid political tensions.
Therefore, while the chief justice’s vision to enable access to justice is laudable, without addressing deep-rooted flaws, its scalability remains uncertain.

• Six more die of starvation; 10 injured by aid drops; trucks entering from north mobbed by desperate population
• World welcomes 10-hour daily ‘pause’ in Israeli military operations; urges Tel Aviv to do more
JERUSALEM: At least six more people succumbed to starvation on Sunday, as food supplies finally trickled into the Gaza Strip after Jordan and the United Arab Emirates parachuted 25 tonnes of aid into the besieged enclave, the first airdrop in months.
According to aid groups, mass hunger haunts Gaza’s 2.2 million people, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) saying that a third of the population of Gaza has not eaten for days, and 470,000 people are “enduring famine-like conditions”.
Since Israel imposed a total blockade on aid entering Gaza on March 2, the situation inside the territory has deteriorated sharply. More than 100 NGOs warned last week of “mass starvation” in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
Six deaths were reported over the past 24 hours due to malnutrition, bringing the total toll from hunger to 133, including 87 children. A Jordanian official told Reu­ters that airdrops were not a substitute for delivery by land to feed the starving populace which faced Israel-manufactured famine for weeks.
Palestinian health officials in Gaza City said at least 10 people were injured by falling aid boxes; however, most were happy about the prospects of finally getting a meal.
“People are happy that large amounts of food aid will come into Gaza,” said Tamer Al-Burai, a business owner. “We hope today marks a first step in ending this war that burned everything up.”.
Humeid, a 23-year-old from the Al-Karama neighbourhood of Gaza City, told AFP that dozens of people had gathered to rush towards the palettes of supplies parachuted onto the area.
“It felt like a war, everyone trying to grab whatever they could. Hunger is merciless. The quantities were extremely limited, not enough even for a few people, because hunger is everywhere. I only managed to get three cans of fava beans,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Red Crescent said it was sending more than 100 trucks carrying over 1,200 metric tonnes of food to southern Gaza on Sunday. A Palestinian official source said on Sunday afternoon that the trucks were still being inspected at Kerem Shalom and had not yet entered Gaza.
The desperation for food was evident from the fact that seven to 10 trucks filled with flour, which were allowed into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, could not all make it to Gaza City.
Hungry crowds surrounded them, and people who were desperate for one bag of flour and other basic necessities mobbed them, Al Jazeera reported.
Meanwhile, Al Jazeera also reported that more than 53 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 32 who had been waiting to receive aid.
Military operations ‘paused’
The aid drops came amid an announcement by Israel that it would ‘pause’ its military operations in parts of Gaza for 10 hours a day, and allow new aid corridors.
The military said designated secure routes for convoys delivering food and medicine will also be in place between 6am and 11pm, starting from Sunday.
Military activity will stop from 10 am to 8 pm (0700-1700 GMT) until further notice in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian area along the coast, in central Deir al-Balah and in Gaza City, to the north.
The Israeli military also said it had also begun airdropping food into the Palestinian territory – making one drop of seven palettes.
Hamas denounced the Israeli measures to allow more aid into Gaza, saying Israel was continuing its military offensive. “What is happening isn’t a humanitarian truce,” said Hamas official Ali Baraka in a statement on Sunday.
International concern
While Israel’s decision to pause military operations and allow aid into Gaza were welcomed, most actors agreed the actions fall short of what is needed to alleviate suffering in the besieged enclave.
Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Israel’s announcement was “essential but long overdue”, and that access to aid must now be urgently accelerated over the coming hours and days.
UN emergency relief coordinator Tom Fletcher said their teams would “do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window”.
UN rights chief Volker Turk said Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, was obliged to ensure sufficient food was provided to the population.
“Children are starving and dying in front of our eyes. Gaza is a dystopian landscape of deadly attacks and total destruction,” he said in a statement.
“The starvation of people in Gaza must end now,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said on X.
 






Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation warned on Sunday that malnutrition rates were reaching “alarming levels” in the Gaza Strip, marked by a spike in deaths in July.

Speaking to Arab News ahead of the conference, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan has a clear foreign policy for decades that the two-state solution is the only answer to the Palestine problem.”
He welcomed the initiative by France and Saudi Arabia, describing it as “very appreciable”, and expressed hope that the summit would lead to concrete results.
“I hope that serious efforts are made during this event, first, to secure an immediate ceasefire, and second, to ensure the unhindered flow of food, humanitarian aid and medical assistance — alongside progress toward the recognition of Palestine as an independent state,” the deputy premier said.

France, S. Arabia-hosted UN conference on two-state solution kicks off today in New York

The three-day conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is being held at the UN headquarters in New York and has drawn participation from 123 countries and international organisations. It aims to chart a concrete path towards the two-state solution through proposals developed by eight working groups, which have held extensive consultations with UN member states and civil society groups.
The conference is receiving global attention following French President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement this week that France will formally recognise the State of Palestine—making it the first G7 country to do so.
While Macron said the recognition will be formalised at the UN General Assembly in September, Washington strongly condemned France’s decision. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a post on X, called the move a “reckless decision,” claiming it “only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace”.
The US, under President Donald Trump, has announced that it will not attend the conference. Israel is also boycotting the event.
A diplomatic cable, reportedly shared with multiple capitals and seen by Reuters in Paris and Washington, revealed that the US had warned governments against participating in the conference, arguing that it could derail ongoing efforts to secure the release of Israeli prisoners and end the war in Gaza.
Despite the US objections, several European countries have signalled their intent to follow France’s lead. In May, fellow EU members Norway, Ireland, and Spain announced that they had begun the process of recognising a Palestinian state.
Currently, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states either recognise or have indicated plans to recognise Palestine. However, several influential Western countries—including the US, the UK, and Germany — have yet to do so.
Pakistan’s participation in the conference aligns with its longstanding support for the two-state solution. Islamabad had earlier voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution last year calling for an international summit on the issue in June 2025. That summit could not take place last month.
 
 

As president of the UN Security Council for July 2025, Pakistan chaired the July 24 open debate on the Palestine issue. “Pakistan’s position is absolutely clear — we are firmly on the right side of history and remain steadfast in our support,” Dar stated.
In the interview, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to diplomacy: “The solution to conflicts does not lie in kinetic actions — wars and violence. The real path forward is through dialogue and diplomacy, and we are firm believers in this approach.”
France has said the goal of the New York meeting is to move beyond rhetoric and offer “concrete measures” to revive the stalled peace process. Organisers hope the momentum from this conference will lead to broader international consensus in favour of Palestinian statehood.

• SCBA president hopes move will reduce gaps between case hearings
A RECENT move by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) to expand free legal aid initiatives to all levels of the judiciary is expected to come as a blessing for scores of litigants, whose inability to engage experienced counsel could’ve otherwise delayed their cases indefinitely.
The initiative, recently anno­unced by the commission led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, expands the legal aid facility, which was earlier only available in the lower judiciary.
Now, litigants can avail this facility from the magistrate courts right up to the superior judiciary.
Since 2012, around Rs115 million have been provided to underprivileged people to help cover the cost of pursuing cases in courts.
The funds were provided by the District Legal Empowerment Committees (DLECs), an initiative aimed at ensuring universal access to justice. So far, the initiative has provided free legal aid to over 7,000 litigants across Pakistan, a source told Dawn.
The committees were constituted by the LJCP to help those unable to pursue cases in courts due to financial constraints.
The commission’s secretariat supports these committees through the Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF), which covers the costs of lawyers, court fees, copying charges, process fees and any other expenses.
These DLECs are functioning in 132 districts across Pakistan, including the ex-Fata region.
To apply for funding, deserving litigants submit a request on plain paper to the district and sessions judge with a copy of their identification document.
The litigants are provided funds to pursue criminal, civil and family matters. The funds are given to lawyers in two instalments: at the time of assigning the case and the final instalment after the case is decided.
According to the breakdown of Rs114.8m disbursed under the initiative, Rs33.8m was released to 36 DLECs in Punjab, Rs20.8m to 27 committees in Sindh, Rs31.6m to 35 committees in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rs25.8m to 32 committees in Balochistan and Rs2.8m to two committees in Islamabad.
Under the programme, the district jail superintendent can also forward applications of under-trial or convicted prisoners or any inmate if they need assistance to pursue their cases.
The committee can also consider cases referred by any court for legal aid to those with pending cases.
‘Blessing’ for litigants
The financial assistance available for each litigant has also been enhanced from Rs40,000 to Rs50,000.
Appreciating the initiative, Supreme Court Bar Association  President Mian Muhammad Rauf Atta said the programme will prove to be a “blessing”, especially to inmates whose cases remained pending for years only because they could not afford a lawyer to represent them in courts.
Now, their cases will be heard on time, Mr Atta said. He added sometimes, the litigants’ inability to hire an experienced counsel due to financial issues complicates their cases.
This issue has also been rectified through the initiative since DLECs will select lawyers from a list provided by the district and sessions judges concerned or by the superior judiciary.
When asked whether Rs50,000 were enough for litigants to pursue cases, Mr Atta said the initiative was a start and the funding might get enhanced in future.
The DLECs, presided over by the district and sessions judge, comprised the district co-ordination officer/deputy commissioner/political agent, superintendent, district jail, district bar association president and a civil society representative as members.
As per the directions of AJDF, banners and posters are displayed in court premises, bar rooms, offices of the deputy commissioners and district revenue officers and district jails to inform litigants and under-trial prisoners about the facility.
The internal audit of the fund is conducted annually in accordance with relevant laws of provincial governments.

• TV anchor, family among 15 feared swept away in Babusar
• Partial reopening of Babusar Road expected today
GILGIT: People displaced by flash floods across multiple areas of Gilgit-Baltistan have complained of severe shortages of clean drinking water, electricity, road access and communication services.
Survivors in the flood-stricken Babusar and Thore valleys of Diamer said they had been hit by one of the deadliest floods in recent memory, which left many homeless and swept away their belongings.
In the Gilgit region, thousands of residents in Danyor and Sultanabad areas remained without drinking water for three consecutive days after a flash flood from Danyor Nallah damaged the main supply pipeline and several irrigation channels.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
They said that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again. No restoration work has been initiated, they lamented and gave a one-day ultimatum to the government for action or they would launch protests.
Meanwhile, residents of Kondus and Haldi in Ghanche district also complained about a lack of relief supplies, electricity, drinking water and road access.
 
 

A devastating landslide in Kondus swept away over 50 homes, leaving scores of families homeless and in urgent need of food, shelter, medical care and emergency services. Locals also lamented the unavailability of the internet, making it even harder to communicate or call for help.
In the Shigar district, flash floods hit the Tisar and Garchahma areas. Resident Sajid Ali said electricity had been out for the last three to four days and that many families had evacuated their homes in search of safer ground. Drinking water was also unavailable, he added.
 
 

People in Jutal and other flood-affected regions of Gilgit-Baltistan also complained about the lack of basic facilities and criticised the government for its slow response and failure to deliver timely relief.
‘15 tourists swept away’
Meanwhile, a private TV anchor, her husband and their four children are also among the tourists reported missing in Babusar Valley, it emerged on Sunday.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the family of an anchorperson for a Pashto-language TV channel had contacted authorities, reporting that she, her husband and their four children had gone missing during the recent flash floods.
Mr Faraq said they had recovered a wallet belonging to the anchorperson, adding that the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. The woman is believed to be among the tourists who were swept away by flash floods on Babusar Highway.
He said that according to eyewitness accounts, between 10 and 15 tourists were swept away by floodwaters on the Babusar Highway. So far, seven bodies have been recovered.
“The search for the remaining missing persons is ongoing with the help of sniffer dogs and drones and personnel from Diamer Police, Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and GB Scouts are participating in the operation,” he said, adding that the effort would continue until all missing individuals are located.
He said additional rescue operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit. Human remains were also recovered during a search operation in the Thak Bhasha area of Diamer, and DNA testing will be required for identification.
Federal Secretary for Commun­ications and Works Sher Alam Masood visited the Babusar Highway site in Chilas alongside local officials to assess the damage.
He told the media that restoration efforts using heavy machinery were ongoing, with the road blocked in 15 locations and partial clearance achi­eved at 13 of them. He hoped that the highway would be partially reopened for traffic by Monday (today).

• Security officials and KP govt announce compensation for victims
• 2 Chitral Scouts martyred in clash near Afghan border
KHYBER: A protest over the killing of a minor girl in Tirah took a turn for the worse on Sunday, as seven people were shot after a demonstration outside a military installation took a violent turn, eye-witnesses and sources told Dawn.
Following the incident, security officials met with tribal elders and announced compensation for the victims, assuring that medical treatment would be provided to the injured. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has announced separate compensation for the deceased and injured.
Hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz early on Sunday morning.
Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men,  ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.
 
 

They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, and then tried to force open the garrison’s main gate.
Security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.
At least six protesters were killed and seventeen others received bullet injuries, sources said.
There was no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike, or Sunday’s killings.
Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.
The injured were shifted to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud,  Dogra hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar.
One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.
Security officials meet tribal elders
As the situation became tense, a delegation of Tirah elders held a series of meetings with security officials at Brigade Headquarters.
Subsequently, the protesters dispersed following the intervention of elders.
Security officials said the local sector commander met with elders in Tirah and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.
Officials also expressed their sympathies with the relatives of those who had lost their lives on Sunday, sources told Dawn.
On the elders’ demand, security forces announced compensation for the families of the deceased and the injured.
A statement issued from the KP chief minister’s secretariat said the provincial government was grieved over the loss of lives in Tirah.
The provincial government will give Rs10 million to the deceased and Rs2.5m to the injured.
The statement added the provincial government was committed to sustainable peace, mutual respect and public safety. The KP government had called a jirga comprising tribal elders and public representatives to address their issues.
“The district administration and institutions have been directed to strengthen communication with the public and maintain law and order situation,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.
Protest
Later, MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with their supporters, held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud against Sunday’s incident.
They demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident along with adequate compensation for the victims.
The lawmakers opposed the military operation in Tirah valley and demanded peace without displacing the locals.
Meanwhile, residents in Peer Mela have claimed mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons during the last ten days.
They claimed mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.
Security officials martyred
Separately, two security personnel embraced martyrdom in an exchange of fire with militants in the Arsoon village of Chitral, which borders Afghanistan, on Sunday morning.
Official sources told Dawn that forces retaliated against the indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by militants.
Five personnel were also injured in the exchange.
According to the official sources, security forces inflicted heavy casualties on militants and forced them to pull back from their village.
Umer Farooq in Peshawar and Zahiruddin in Chitral also contributed to this report

Officials said the ill-fated fishing vessel had set out from Karachi and capsized in deep waters. Local fishermen rushed to the scene after receiving distress reports and managed to rescue one survivor.
“Six fishermen were on board when the boat capsized,” an official said. Rescue teams, assisted by local fishermen, later recovered the bodies of the five deceased men.
The bodies of two fishermen were sent to Karachi, while three remain in the custody of Edhi authorities in Gwadar. One of the victims, a resident of Ali Akbar Shah Goth in Ibrahim Haideri, was laid to rest following funeral prayers held after Zuhr.
Further investigation into the incident is underway.

The ADF, originally formed from former Ugandan rebels and which pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2019, raided a Catholic church in the town of Komanda where worshippers were gathered for prayer, complained residents of Bunia, the capital of Ituri province.
“Last night around 9pm, we heard gunfire near the parish church... so far we have seen 35 bodies,” Dieudonne Katanabo, an Umoja neighbourhood elder, said.
“We have at least 31 dead members of the Eucharistic Crusade movement, with six seriously injured... some young people were kidnapped, we have no news of them,” Father Aime Lokana Dhego, parish priest of the Blessed Anuarite parish of Komanda, said. The priest added that seven other bodies had been discovered in the town.
Likewise attributing the attack to “ADF rebels”, Christophe Munyanderu, coordinator of the local NGO Convention for the Respect of Human Rights, gave a provisional death toll of 38.
Army spokesman in Ituri, Lt Jules Ngongo, did not comment on the toll but confirmed the attack to AFP, stating that “the enemy is believed to have been identified among ADF” fighters. The bloodshed comes after months of calm in the region of Ituri, bordering Uganda.
The last major attack by the ADF was in February, leaving 23 dead in Mambasa territory.
The town of Komanda in Irumu territory is a commercial hub linking three other provinces —Tshopo, North Kivu, and Maniema.
The ADF has killed thousands of civilians and ramped up looting and killing in northeastern DRC despite the deployment both of the Ugandan army alongside Congolese armed forces in the area.

According to the event’s website, ‘TechNova’ is a premier tech and innovation event bringing together students, professionals, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.
It is a unique blend of technical and non-technical modules. The event provides an engaging platform for participants to showcase their skills, compete in exciting challenges, and explore emerging technologies.
Speaking to Dawn.com, the event’s vice president, Muhammad Anas — a final year student at IoBM, said: “This was the first tech-centric event in the history of IoBM; it had multiple tech modules, including a final year project showcase, a startup launchpad, speed programming, prompt engineering, web and logo design, and maths mania.”
He added that winners were awarded with a cash prize of up to Rs50,000, and the competition was attended by students, teachers, technology experts and professionals from more than 25 universities across the country.
“Alhamdulillah, we had more people than expected. Around 500+ participants and visitors, excluding university students and staff who made up a footfall of around 2500 to 3000 people,” Anas added.
The event — organised under the College of Computer Science and Information Systems, aimed to provide an opportunity for youth to express their technology, creative thinking and practical skills, according to a press release by the competition.
The event, affiliated with the varsity’s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) student branch, began with an opening session, which was attended by the leadership of the institute and personalities from the tech industry.
The event also included a special artificial intelligence symposium, in which experts discussed the future of artificial intelligence and its educational and industrial significance.
The speakers included Microsoft Pakistan Country Education Lead Jibran Jamshed, Telec Group Director Brigadier Musharraf Khan, Rector Professor Dr Tariq Rahim Soomro, and other notable speakers.
In the final year project competition, the students presented innovative ideas which were not only appreciated but some teams also received investment offers. Students demonstrated their creative skills in web and logo designing, while speed programming demonstrated their technical abilities through accurate coding within a set time. Academic competitions were held in ‘Maths Mania’ and ‘Prompt Engineering’, while the youth presented business ideas through ‘Launchpad’.
Speaking about their project, the winner of the startup launchpad competition, Ayaan Amir, a mechanical engineering student, said: “My project was a healthy food startup called GreenBite. We aim to provide oil-free meals that are not only healthy and delicious but also affordable.”
He added that there was a demand for a service for health-conscious individuals who want a reliable, daily meal solution without compromising on flavour or budget, and that the judges had encouraged his team to reach out to them to develop the idea further.
In May, Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU), Department of Law, organised a contest under the theme of ‘Legislative Drafting and Policy Competition on AI Governance’ in the university.
The event was organised in collaboration with Sehrish Saba Raja and Associates Legal Clinic and Research Centre, The Society 5.0 Initiative, Law Students’ Council Pakistan, and other distinguished partners.
It brought together 11 teams from leading universities and think tanks across the country to present innovative legislative and policy proposals on artificial intelligence governance.

The 24-year-old Australian managed his tyres expertly to remain out of reach in the closing laps as the Briton, 25, who had started on pole, closed in on a harder-wearing compound, finishing 3.415 seconds clear as McLaren reeled off their sixth 1-2 in a dominant season.
It was Piastri’s first win at the classic Spa-Francorchamps circuit, his sixth this season and the eighth of his career, extending his lead in the drivers’ championship to 16 points after 13 of this season’s 24 races. For McLaren, it was a 10th win this year.
Charles Leclerc came a solid third for Ferrari ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, under the race leadership of new team boss Laurent Mekies for the first time, and Mercedes’ George Russell.
Alex Albon clung on to finish sixth for Williams ahead of chasing seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari, who started from the pit lane, and Racing Bulls’ rookie Liam Lawson.
Gabriel Botoleto was ninth for Sauber ahead of Pierre Gasly of Alpine.
“That was lively!” said the cool Piastri, who swept past Norris on lap one.
“Very lively. I knew that lap one was probably my best chance of winning the race. I lifted a little as I went through Eau Rouge, and then it was enough.
“The rest of the race we managed really well. Maybe the medium wasn’t the best in the last five-six laps, but we had it almost under control! I was disappointed after yesterday, but it turns out that starting second was not too bad.”
Norris conceded he couldn’t have won.
“Oscar just did a good job — there’s nothing much more to say. He was committed a bit more in Eau Rouge and that was it. Oscar deserved it today.”
Leclerc said: “Max was behind me all race within two seconds, so it’s never easy. I knew the first part was the trickiest, and I’m pretty happy we managed to keep that third place.”
The race began, after an 80-minute delay due to heavy rain, with the entire field on intermediates to run for four laps behind a safety car, clearing standing water.
Piastri’s craft and calm
Four drivers started from the pitlane — Carlos Sainz, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Antonelli and Lewis Hamilton — having made changes to their power units or set-up overnight. They began at the rear of the field ahead of the rolling start at the start of lap five.
As the lights went green, Norris powered away to lead through La Source, but he was unable to resist when Piastri sneaked out of his slipstream to take the lead going into Les Combes chicane.
“Why do I have no pack?” asked Norris, realising he lacked electric power. “We used a lot on the safety car re-start,” McLaren responded.
On lap 12, Hamilton was the first in for medium slick tyres, rejoining 18th, followed by Piastri, Leclerc, Verstappen, Russell and more. Norris stayed out one lap longer for hards, hoping to profit if his rival’s rubber degraded in the closing laps. He was the only one.
By lap 15, everyone else had switched to mediums and it was Piastri on top ahead of Norris by 9.3 with Leclerc third leading Verstappen, Russell, Albon and… in flying form, Hamilton.
As Norris closed in, Piastri said his tyres were already degrading. “I think it will be tough to get to the end,” he told race engineer Tom Stallard, raising the prospect of a dramatic finale.
On lap 26, Norris slid wide at Puhon, falling back to nine seconds adrift before remounting his charge. It was a process of marginal gains as Piastri managed his tyres.
Norris was close but Piastri’s craft and calm prevailed.</p><small>2025-07-27 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27231509d97a657.jpg?r=231638' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926959/sundar-and-jadeja-follow-gills-lead-as-defiant-india-draw-fourth-test-with-england' target='_blank'><strong>Sundar and Jadeja follow Gill’s lead as defiant India draw fourth Test with England</strong></a><br><p>India’s enthralling series in England is going all the way to the finish after the resilient tourists drew the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Sunday.
Record-breaking skipper Shubman Gill scored his fourth century of the campaign before Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar also made hundreds.
England remain 2-1 up in this five-match contest ahead of a quick turnaround to Thursday’s start of an Oval finale, where an India victory in south London would ensure a share of the spoils for Gill’s men.
A draw looked anything but likely when India collapsed to 0-2 in the opening over of their second innings on Saturday as Chris Woakes struck with successive deliveries after England had piled up a mammoth 669 in their first innings.
But Gill, in on a hat-trick, went on to score 103 in a marathon innings of some seven hours as he turned the tide during a stand of 188 with KL Rahul that ended before lunch on Sunday’s last day.
Jadeja, reprieved first ball when Joe Root dropped a tough slip chance, went on to make 107 not out, his first century of the series following four fifties, with fellow spin-bowling all-rounder Sundar unbeaten on 101 — his maiden Test hundred.
India has now scored 11 individual hundreds this series, the most by any visiting side in England, and such was their eventual dominance on Sunday that they had no need to worry about whether to send Rishabh Pant out to bat following the severe foot injury he suffered in the first innings.
Sundar and Jadeja’s unbroken partnership of 203 on a largely docile pitch frustrated a toiling and increasingly fractious England, despite the best efforts of inspirational captain Ben Stokes.
Personal triumph for Stokes
This match was a personal triumph for Stokes as he became just the fourth England cricketer to score a hundred and take five wickets in the same Test, his 141 on Saturday following a haul of 5-72 in India’s first-innings 358.
But it appeared to come at some cost with Stokes, who suffered from cramp while batting, not bowling at all on Saturday and repeatedly clutching the top of his leg. And his efforts to defy history by winning the toss and bowling proved unsuccessful.
No team winning the toss and bowling first has ever won a Test at Old Trafford and this match was only the second draw of Stokes’ reign, following a rain-affected Ashes clash at the Manchester ground two years ago.
India resumed on 174-2 with KL Rahul 87 not out and Gill 78 not out Stokes, already the leading bowler on either side this series with 16 wickets at 24.75, brought himself on at the start of Sunday’s play and almost had Gill caught for 81 by a leaping Ollie Pope at short cover.
But Stokes did have obdurate opener Rahul, in sight of his third century of the series, plumb lbw for 90 to a nip-back ball that kept a touch low.
Stokes bowled an unchanged spell of 1-12 in eight overs until Woakes took the ball — although that did not stop Gill completing a 228-ball century.
Gill was out in surprisingly careless fashion when caught behind, flicking at a Jofra Archer ball outside off stump to end a marathon innings of some seven hours, with India now 222-4.
The 25-year-old Gill, in his first campaign as captain, has now scored 722 runs this series — a record for an India batsman in a series against England, surpassing team-mate Yashasvi Jaiswal’s 712 in 2023/24, Sundar and Jadeja, after his first ball reprieve, were largely untroubled.
And even when Stokes put himself through the pain barrier again, Sundar pulled the England skipper for a six and a four off successive balls to complete a 117-ball fifty.
Sunday’s closing stages simply became a question of whether either Sundar or Jadeja would reach a hundred after Gill declined to take a draw immediately at the start of the last hour.

“We have reached a deal. It’s a good deal for everybody,” Trump told reporters after talks with von der Leyen at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. The EU chief also hailed it as a “good deal”.
Earlier, the US president told reporters he felt the two sides had a 50-50 chance of a deal with the European Union. The bloc faces an across-the-board US levy of 30 per cent unless it strikes a trade pact by August 1.
Washington warned on Sunday there would be “no extensions” and Trump confirmed “the deals all start on August 1”.
Von der Leyen’s European Commission, negotiating on behalf of EU countries, is pushing hard for a deal to salvage a trading relationship worth an annual $1.9 trillion in goods and services.
The EU chief said at the start of the talks at Trump’s luxury golf resort in southwestern Turnberry that if they reached a deal, “I think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever” made.
 


According to an EU diplomat briefed ahead of the meeting, the contours of a deal are in place, but key issues still need settling.
“A political deal is on the table — but it needs the sign-off from Trump, who wants to negotiate this down to the very last moment,” the diplomat told AFP.
The proposal, they said, involves a baseline levy of around 15pc on EU exports to the United States — the level secured by Japan — with carve-outs for critical sectors including aircraft and spirits, though not for wine.
Any deal will also need to be approved by EU member states, whose ambassadors, on a visit to Greenland, were updated by the commission Sunday morning. They would meet again after any accord.
According to the EU diplomat, the 27 countries broadly endorsed the deal as envisaged — while recalling their negotiating red lines.
Baseline 15pc
The Trump-von der Leyen meeting was taking place in the president’s luxury golf resort in Turnberry on Scotland’s southwestern coast. The 79-year-old Trump said on Friday he hoped to strike “the biggest deal of them all” with the EU.
The EU is focused on getting a deal to avoid sweeping tariffs that would further harm its sluggish economy — while holding out retaliation as a last resort.
Under the proposal described to AFP, the EU would commit to ramping up purchases of US liquefied natural gas, along with other investment pledges.
Pharmaceuticals, a key export for Ireland, would also face a 15pc levy, as would semiconductors.
The EU also appears to have secured a compromise on steel that could allow a certain quota into the United States before tariffs would apply, the diplomat said.
But Trump said on Sunday that trade tariffs with the EU would not be lower than 15pc.
Auto sector
The EU has been hit by multiple waves of tariffs since Trump reclaimed the White House. It is currently subject to a 25pc levy on cars, 50pc on steel and aluminium, and an across-the-board tariff of 10pc, which Washington threatens to hike to 30pc in a no-deal scenario.
 
 

It was unclear how the proposed deal would impact tariff levels on the auto industry, crucial for France and Germany. Carmakers are already reeling from the levies imposed so far.
While 15pc would be much higher than pre-existing US tariffs on European goods, which average around 4.8pc, it would mirror the status quo, with companies currently facing an additional flat rate of 10pc.
Should talks fail, EU states have greenlit counter tariffs on $109 billion (€93bn) of US goods, including aircraft and cars, to take effect in stages from August 7.
Brussels is also drawing up a list of US services to potentially target.
Beyond that, countries including France say Brussels should not be afraid to deploy a so-called trade “bazooka” — EU legislation designed to counter coercion that can involve restricting access to its market and public contracts.
But such a step would mark a major escalation with Washington.
Ratings dropping
Trump has embarked on a campaign to reshape US trade with the world, and has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive tariffs if they do not reach a pact with Washington by August 1.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the August 1 deadline was firm and there will be “no extensions, no more grace periods.”
Polls suggest, however, that the American public is unconvinced by the White House strategy, with a recent Gallup survey showing his approval rating at 37pc, down 10 points from January.
Having promised “90 deals in 90 days,” Trump’s administration has so far unveiled five, including with Britain, Japan and the Philippines.</p><small>2025-07-27 17:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27223756105f407.jpg?r=224213' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926954/godzilla-fans-fete-the-monster-as-it-turns-70' target='_blank'><strong>Godzilla fans fete the monster as it turns 70</strong></a><br><p>Godzilla has morphed over the years, but one constant is the devotion of its fans, who celebrated the Japanese monster’s 70th anniversary at the pop culture convention Comic-Con.
The Japanese studio Toho, which created Godzilla, maintains a calendar of events to celebrate the beast often called the king of monsters, and Comic-Con is on the agenda.
Godzilla was born on November 3, 1954 with the launch of the first movie about it, directed by Ishiro Honda.
“I am a very big fan of Godzilla,” said Angela Hill, a teacher who travelled from Arizona to take part in Comic-Con, which this year featured events and displays celebrating Godzilla.
One of the world’s largest celebrations of pop culture, Comic-Con brings together 130,000 people, many of whom come dressed as wizards, princesses or characters from movies, games or TV series.
As the story of Godzilla goes, a prehistoric amphibious beast is awakened and mutated by nuclear bomb testing in the Pacific. It emerges from the sea and attacks Japan in a rage, symbolising the deadly power of nuclear weapons.

“I think because he came from such a historic event — like, a lot of other monsters are just interesting creatures, but they don’t hold the grief of a nation,” Hill said, referring to the US nuclear bomb attacks against Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
At the pop culture watering hole in San Diego, people lined up to shoot pictures and video with an image of Godzilla, which was also the theme of a panel discussion on Friday that featured Shinji Higuchi, who co-directed a reboot in 2016 called “Shin Godzilla.”
The movie franchise includes nearly 40 films and has spawned hundreds of animated productions about the monster as well as TV series and graphic work.
‘Rooting for him’
On Saturday, writers Ed Godziszewski and Steve Ryfle signed autographs of their book Godzilla: The First 70 Years, which sold out at Comic-Con.
“It’s a rich history,” Ryfle told AFP. “This is the longest-running feature film franchise in cinematic history that’s focused on a single, continuous character. It’s been around longer than James Bond.”
 
 

He said the key to its longevity is that Godzilla has evolved over time but stayed faithful to its origins.
“Godzilla has been serious, it’s been scary, it’s been heroic, it’s been funny. But at the same time, this is a movie character that’s rooted in something that’s very real,” Ryfle said.
“And that’s the trauma that Japan experienced, both during World War II, and also the trauma of the aftermath of World War II, the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” he added.

He said Honda, who directed the first Godzilla movie, was a veteran who used the film to send a message against war and, in particular, against nuclear weapons.
Michelle Pena, a Godzilla fan who waited in line to get the autograph of the two writers, said part of the monster’s charm is how it has changed over the years.
“Good, bad, hero, anti-hero, you know. And I like that,” she said.
“He’s not, like, lovable,” she added. “He’s a big dinosaur-looking thing, you know. He’s scary. But, like, you really, really find yourself rooting for him.”</p><small>2025-07-27 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271619432c8ee97.jpg?r=162000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926929/pakistani-pilgrims-barred-from-by-road-travel-to-iran-iraq-this-arbaeen-interior-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.
Pilgrims visit Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that zaireen (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.
He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.
However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.
 






Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.
Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights” for the pilgrims, APP stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.
Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.
Pakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.
 
 

Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.
Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf retracted his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.
PM tells Naqvi to start work on Gwadar Safe City project
During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.
The project aims to provide a safer city for the residents of Gwadar, particularly at the identified strategic locations and also help law enforcement agencies in detecting and investigating crimes by collecting evidence.
 






The delay in the project had been highlighted by Senator Quratulain Marri in May as she chaired a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives.
Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.
 
 

On July 11, a representative of the Balochistan government told a high-level government meeting that 30 per cent of the project was complete, with full completion expected by June 2026.
With the initial plan prepared in 2016, the first phase of the Gwadar Safe City project had been approved by the Central Development Working Party in February 2023 for Rs4.97bn.
PIA announces special flights for pilgrims
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced to operate special flights for billions of pilgrims. according to the airline’s spokesperson.
Four flights will depart from Karachi from August 8 to 11, the announcement said.
Flights for pilgrims returning from Najaf have been scheduled from August 18 to 21.
Ticket sales have started for all flights, the statement added.
“More flights will also be scheduled based on market demand,” the spokesperson said.</p><small>2025-07-27 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27214915993b859.png?r=215003' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926948/donkey-meat-seized-in-islamabads-tarnol-by-citys-food-authority' target='_blank'><strong>Donkey meat seized in Islamabad’s Tarnol by city’s food authority</strong></a><br><p>Donkey meat was seized on Sunday in Islamabad’s Tarnol area by the Islamabad Food Authority, according to a press release by the authority.
“On the tip of the AFSO [assistant food safety officer] team, a cafe was raided, and 25 maunds of donkey meat were recovered,” the statement said.
A case has been registered against a foreign national present at the scene, according to the police.
The case was registered under Sections 11 (Selling food against the law), 12 (Substandard or misbranded food), 13 (Unsafe food) and 14 (Unhygienic or unsanitary place for food) of the Islamabad Capital Territory Food Safety Act, 2021.
As per the first information report (FIR), 1,000 kilogrammes of donkey meat was found at the scene.
“Investigations are underway regarding the supply of donkey meat,” a police spokesperson said in the statement.
Local people involved in the supply of donkey meat are being traced.
“The police are investigating the matter from various angles,” the spokesperson added.
He added that food samples were being sent to the laboratory for analysis.
Items kept in the refrigerator were found to be defective and unusable, the spokesperson added.
“The administration has formed a committee for further investigation,” the statement concluded.
A three-member committee will investigate in which areas the meat was distributed, the police said.

Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects. Indirect ceasefire talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas have broken off with no deal in sight.
Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on March 2 after ceasefire talks broke down. In late May, it began allowing a small trickle of aid to resume, amid warnings of a wave of starvation.
Military activity will stop from 10am to 8pm (12pm to 10pm PKT) until further notice in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian area along the coast, in central Deir al-Balah and in Gaza City, to the north.
The military said designated secure routes for convoys delivering food and medicine will also be in place between 6am and 11pm starting from Sunday.
 


Jordan and the UAE parachuted 25 tons of aid into the Gaza Strip today in their first airdrop in months, a Jordanian official source said.
The official said the air drops were not a substitute for delivery by land. Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy also said Israel’s decision “alone cannot alleviate the needs of those desperately suffering in Gaza”.
Palestinian health officials in Gaza City said at least 10 people were injured by falling aid boxes.
United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said staff would step up efforts to feed the hungry during the pauses in the designated areas.
“Our teams on the ground … will do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window,” he said on X.
 






Israeli firing killed at least 17 people and wounded 50 waiting for aid trucks today, health officials at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in the central Gaza Strip said. Israel’s military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Gaza health ministry reported six new deaths over the past 24 hours due to malnutrition, bringing the total deaths from malnutrition and hunger to 133, including 87 children.
Yesterday, a five-month-old baby, Zainab Abu Haleeb, died of malnutrition at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, health workers said.
“Three months inside the hospital and this is what I get in return, that she is dead,” said her mother, Israa Abu Haleeb, standing next to the baby’s father as he held their daughter’s body wrapped in a white shroud.

The Egyptian Red Crescent said it was sending more than 100 trucks carrying over 1,200 metric tons of food to southern Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing on Sunday.
Aid groups said last week there was mass starvation among Gaza’s 2.2 million people and international alarm over the humanitarian situation has increased, driving French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state in September.
A group of 25 states, including Britain, France and Canada, last week condemned the “drip feeding of aid” and said Israel’s denial of essential humanitarian aid was unacceptable.
“We ask God and our Arab brothers to work harder to reach a ceasefire before we all die,” Gaza resident Hossam Sobh told AFP, adding that he had feared death as he recovered a bag of flour under the nose of an Israeli tank.
The Israeli military also claimed it had begun air-dropping food into the territory and rejected allegations it was using starvation as a weapon against Palestinian civilians.
In a statement, the army said it coordinated its decisions with the UN and international organisations to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip”.
The Israeli statement claimed that “designated secure routes” had been opened across all of Gaza to enable the safe passage of UN and humanitarian aid organisation convoys delivering and distributing food and medicine.
UN to use pauses to try to reach Gaza’s starving
The United Nations said it would try to reach as many starving people as possible in Gaza after Israel announced it would establish secure land routes for humanitarian convoys.
The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) said it had enough food in, or on its way to, the region to feed the over 2m people in the Gaza Strip for almost three months.
WFP said the pauses and corridors should allow emergency food to be safely delivered. “Food aid is the only real way for most people inside Gaza to eat,” it said in a statement.
It said a third of the population had not been eating for days, and 470,000 people in Gaza “are enduring famine-like conditions” that were leading to deaths.
 


WFP said more than 62,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed monthly to cover the entire Gaza population.
The agency noted that, on top of Sunday’s “pause” announcement, Israel had pledged to allow more trucks to enter Gaza with quicker clearances along with “assurances of no armed forces or shootings near convoys”.
“Together, we hope these measures will allow for a surge in urgently needed food assistance to reach hungry people without further delays,” it said.
“People are happy that large amounts of food aid will come into Gaza,” said Tamer Al-Burai, a business owner.
“We hope today marks a first step in ending this war that burned everything up.”
 
 

Hamas denounced the Israeli measures to allow more aid into Gaza, saying Israel was continuing its military offensive.
“What is happening isn’t a humanitarian truce,” said Hamas official Ali Baraka in a statement on Sunday.
Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticised the aid decision, saying it was made without his involvement. He called it a capitulation to Hamas’s campaign and repeated his call to choke off all aid to Gaza, conquer the territory and order Palestinians to leave.
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a question about Ben-Gvir’s comments.
‘Dystopian landscape, starving civilians’
UN rights chief Volker Turk said Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, was obliged to ensure sufficient food was provided to the population.
“Children are starving and dying in front of our eyes. Gaza is a dystopian landscape of deadly attacks and total destruction,” he said in a statement.
 






He criticised a US- and Israel-backed outfit, called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), that in late May began distributing foodstuffs when UN-organised efforts were blocked.
Turk said the GHF’s “chaotic, militarised” distribution sites were “failing utterly to deliver humanitarian aid at the scope and scale needed”.
The GHF has faced fierce international criticism after Israeli fire killed nearly 800 aid seekers near distribution points since May 27.
A report by The Guardian revealed that food-deprived Palestinians in Gaza get as little as eight minutes to grab aid from GHF sites, which are located in evacuation zones, meaning that displaced Palestinians have to enter the areas they have previously been ordered to leave.

Yesterday alone, over 50 more Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes and shootings, some as they waited near aid distribution centres, the Palestinian civil defence agency said.
A number of Western and Arab governments carried out air drops in Gaza in 2024, when aid deliveries by land also faced Israeli restrictions, but many in the humanitarian community consider them ineffective.
“Air drops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians.”
 






Much of Gaza now lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on October 7, 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign in response has killed at least 59,733 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave, including the hospital system. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.
Activist boat Handala seized by Israel
Also on Sunday, Israeli forces seized and brought the pro-Palestinian activist boat Handala into the port of Ashdod on Sunday, after intercepting the vessel in international waters and detaining the crew, an AFP journalist saw.
Late last night, Israeli troops boarded a boat carrying activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition as it attempted to approach Gaza from the sea to challenge a naval blockade.
 






“Israeli forces illegally boarded ‘Handala’ in international waters, abducting 21 unarmed civilians,” the FFC said on X, sharing a video that showed purported Israeli soldiers taking away the activists.
“Demand your government end its complicity in Israeli war crimes, ensure the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, and call for the immediate release of all crew members,” the coalition said.
The live feed on the Handala boat belonging to the FFC showed Israeli troops boarding the vessel. The soldiers moved in as the boat approached Gaza and three live video feeds of the scene broadcasting online were cut minutes later.
 






On board were activists from 10 countries, including two French MPs from the left-wing France Unbowed party, Emma Fourreau and Gabrielle Cathala.
The activists include at least five citizens from the United States, three from France, two from Italy, Spain and Australia, and one each from the United Kingdom, Norway and Tunisia.
The legal rights centre Adalah told AFP its lawyers were in Ashdod and had been allowed to speak to 19 members of the 21-strong international crew, which included two French parliamentarians and two Al Jazeera journalists.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The remaining two of those detained were dual US and Israeli citizens and had been transferred to police custody, Adalah said.
“After 12 hours at sea, following the unlawful interception of the Handala, Israeli authorities confirmed the vessel’s arrival at Ashdod port,” said the group, set up to campaign for the rights of Israel’s Arab population.
“Adalah reiterates that the activists aboard the Handala were part of a peaceful civilian mission to break through Israel’s illegal blockade on Gaza.”</p><small>2025-07-27 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/27191837a7ef5d4.jpg?r=193337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926945/ukrainian-drones-target-st-petersburg-as-russias-putin-attends-scaled-down-navy-day' target='_blank'><strong>Ukrainian drones target St Petersburg as Russia’s Putin attends scaled-down Navy Day</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian drones targeted St Petersburg on Sunday, Russian authorities said, forcing the airport to close for five hours as Russian President Vladimir Putin marked the country’s Navy Day in the city, despite the earlier cancellation of its naval parade due to security concerns.
St Petersburg usually holds a large-scale, televised navy parade on Navy Day, which features a flotilla of warships and military vessels sailing down the Neva River and is attended by Putin.
Last year, Russia suspected a Ukrainian plan to attack the city’s parade, according to state television.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Sunday that this year’s parade had been cancelled for security reasons, following first reports of its cancellation in early July.
Putin arrived at the city’s historic naval headquarters on Sunday by a patrol speed boat, from where he followed drills involving more than 150 vessels and 15,000 military personnel in the Pacific and Arctic Oceans and Baltic and Caspian Seas.
“Today we are marking this holiday in a working setting, we are inspecting the combat readiness of the fleet,” Putin said in a video address.
The Russian Defence Ministry said air defence units downed a total of 291 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones on Sunday, below a record 524 drones downed in attacks on May 7, ahead of Russia’s Victory Day parade on May 9.
Alexander Drozdenko, governor of the Leningrad region surrounding St Petersburg, said that over 10 drones were downed over the area, and falling debris injured a woman. At 8:40 GMT (1:40 pm PST) on Sunday, Drozdenko said that the attack was repelled.
St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport was closed during the attack, with 57 flights delayed and 22 diverted to other airports, according to a statement. Pulkovo resumed operations later on Sunday.
Russian blogger Alexander Yunashev, part of an official group of reporters travelling with Peskov, said Peskov had told him their flight from Moscow to St Petersburg had been delayed by the drone attack for two hours on Sunday.</p><small>2025-07-27 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616036-visa-free-entry-to-uae-begins-for-pakistanis-with-diplomatic-official-passports' target='_blank'><strong>Visa-free entry to UAE begins for Pakistanis with diplomatic, official passports</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
In a post on X, Dar announced the agreement with the UAE’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing the decision between “our two brotherly countries”.
“I have been informed by the UAE authorities that the visa waiver for diplomatic and official Pakistani passports entering the United Arab Emirates has been activated, effective July 25, 2025, at all UAE airports,” the foreign minister wrote.
“We agreed [on] mutual visa waivers on diplomatic and official passports between our two brotherly countries and we both signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to make this arrangement effective and operative after 30 days of the signing,” he added.
According to Dar, reciprocal arrangements have also been activated for Emirati nationals at all Pakistani airports.
 






Earlier this month, UAE’s Interior Minister Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens.
Al Nahyan’s statement came during a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Mohsin Naqvi.
During the visit, Naqvi emphasised the importance of easing the visa policy, stating, “We want Pakistani citizens to come to the UAE with ease. Relaxation in visa policies will bring great relief.”
In June, Pakistan and the UAE signed an MoU on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC).</p><small>2025-07-27 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271627142386f38.png?r=162742' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926904/fatima-sana-aims-to-continue-pakistan-womens-winning-momentum-on-ireland-t20-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Fatima Sana aims to continue Pakistan women’s winning momentum on Ireland T20 tour</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s cricket captain Fatima Sana on Sunday said that her team will look to continue their winning momentum on the upcoming Ireland tour.
On Wednesday, the Pakistan Cricket Board named the squads, with Fatima continuing to lead the team, as the national selection committee named a 15-member squad for the forthcoming T20 International series in Ireland.
The three-match T20 series against Ireland will be played at the Clontarf Cricket Club in Dublin from August 6 to 10.
In their last encounter in April, Pakistan women defeated Ireland by 38 runs in a low-scoring thriller to win the opening One-Day International (ODI) encounter of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 Qualifiers. Led by Fatima, Pakistan subsequently qualified for the World Cup after winning the tournament unbeaten, which was held in Lahore earlier this year
Responding to a question by Dawn.com at the National Stadium in Karachi, Fatima said, “Despite the difference in conditions, batters are confident and since our Qualifiers went well, we are going into the series with confidence.
“We are looking to continue that momentum and looking forward to do well — along with developing the T20I side as well.”
She also spoke about how she tries to contribute to the team in any domain, whether batting, bowling or fielding, adding, “I’ve been trying to improve my batting and play a role in the team’s victory in any aspect that I can.”
Top-order batter Muneeba Ali, speaking on the team’s batting performance, said: “Despite the difference in formats between the Irish tour and the World Cup, we are looking to focus on T20Is and work on 50-over format game alongside as well.”

The Southpaw opener added, “We have identified where we were lacking in the Qualifiers tournament, and have tried to overcome that [during the training camp] and build upon the positives from that tournament.”
On Saturday, the first phase of preparations for the Pakistan team’s tour to Ireland concluded in Karachi.
The 27-day camp, which started on July 7, was being conducted at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre and the Oval Ground, with an emphasis on refining skills and improving fitness levels ahead of the upcoming tour.
A separate training camp for the 15-member squad will be held from July 28 to August 2, with the team leaving for Ireland on Aug 3.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
 


The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-07-27 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2716480043222db.jpg?r=165131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926933/byc-continues-islamabad-sit-in-amid-id-checks-by-police' target='_blank'><strong>BYC continues Islamabad sit-in amid ID checks by police</strong></a><br><p>Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) activists marked the 12th day of their sit-in in Islamabad on Sunday, demanding the release of their jailed leaders, as protesters alleged police were asking to see their Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs).
BYC, a Baloch advocacy group active since 2018, has been campaigning against enforced disappearances. Its chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting violence, a day after police cracked down on their protest. Earlier this month, an anti-terrorism court remanded them into 15-day police custody.
The Islamabad sit-in began on July 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Political leaders, journalists and activists have joined the sit-in over the past few days.
Last week, the BYC continued the demonstration on the road leading to the National Press Club in Islamabad, as the route had been blocked by police with barbed wire, preventing activists from returning to their original protest site.
An alleged video recorded by the protesters showed police demanding to see their CNICs and warning that failure to comply would result in them not being allowed to continue the demonstration.
In the video, protesters can be heard questioning why police were demanding identification after 12 days of demonstrating, to which an officer responds, “This rule was implemented today.”
A protester can be heard in the video refusing to show their ID card, saying their lawyer was on the way to the protest site.
Speaking to Dawn.com, lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir said that the protesters would not provide their CNIC cards because police reportedly raided the homes of demonstrators.
“Yesterday, some people made videos of the protesters and they identified them, as a result of which their houses are currently being raided,” she said. “This is why we are not providing the ID cards.”
Meanwhile, in a post on X, the BYC condemned the police’s demand for ID cards, accusing them of “further escalating the harassment” and attempting to “suppress and intimidate” the protesters.
“Last night, personnel from law enforcement and intelligence agencies began tailing protestors, following elderly mothers and women back to their temporary residence,” the BYC alleged in the post, adding that these personnel allegedly photographed the residences.
 






“These threatening tactics are taking place with the full backing and coordination of [the] Islamabad Police. Inside the protest space itself, LEA officials are regularly entering and capturing videos of students’ faces to instil fear,” the post further alleged.
According to the BYC, the route to the National Press Club remains blocked and demonstrators have not been allowed to set up a protest camp, despite heavy rain and extreme heat in the city.
“Every day, multiple elderly women and children faint from heat exhaustion,” the post added.</p><small>2025-07-27 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616038-at-least-80-official-vehicles-missing-from-kp-livestock-dept-finds-audit' target='_blank'><strong>At least 80 official vehicles missing from KP livestock dept, finds audit</strong></a><br><p>

The Fisu World University Games is a tournament that brings together students from all over the world every two years to compete across 18 sports. This year, 8,500 students from across the world took part in the event, which was held from July 16 to July 27, according to its website.
In a statement issued today, the PSB said Pakistani contingent’s participation in the tournament faced “significant administrative failures”, including a “lack of transparency in the selection of team officials, discipline issues, logistical mismanagement, and the alarming disappearance of two student-athletes”.
One of the many “failures” was that “two student-athletes were reported missing or suspected of fleeing during the event”, the PSB said, citing the Higher Education Commission (HEC).
The sports board also noted the selection of team officials, all of whom —  except one coach — were from the HEC or its affiliated universities, raising “concerns regarding the transparency and merit of their selection”.
“Additionally, the Pakistani women’s 4x400m relay team was disqualified from the competition, while a judo athlete was allowed to compete without coaching support or an official competition uniform,” the PSB highlighted.
 
 

As a result, the PSB formed a three-member inquiry committee chaired by PSB Lahore Director Noor-us-Sabah, with Nasrullah Rana and Saifur Rehman Rao as members.
The body will “thoroughly examine the selection process and transparency behind the nomination of athletes and officials by HEC” and will submit a report on the matter within 15 days.
It has also been tasked with assessing whether each official’s inclusion in the delegation was aligned with the established selection protocol.
The committee will also investigate the disappearance of two athletes, develop a timeline of events and identify any individuals responsible for negligence or misconduct.
It will further analyse the reasons behind the disqualification of the women’s relay team, including potential shortcomings in their preparation, selection, or oversight.
 
 

The committee will also determine why the judo athlete was not provided with an appropriate competition uniform and why she competed without a coach, the PSB added.
Lastly, the body will recommend disciplinary action against those found guilty of mismanagement, negligence or dereliction of duty.
In March 2024, boxer Zohaib Rasheed slipped away in Italy during a boxing tour, a move which caused huge embarrassment for Pakistan at the international level.

Both countries have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and upgrading diplomatic ranks. Dar visited Kabul earlier this month, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity.
According to a Foreign Office (FO) statement issued on Saturday, Dar engaged with the Pakistani-American community at the Pakistan Consulate in New York, where he “shared Pakistan’s expectation that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism, noting recent assurances received from Afghan authorities in that regard”.
The foreign minister also highlighted the “country’s outreach to Afghanistan with a view to enhancing regional connectivity through rail and trade corridors to Central Asia”.
 






Dar’s statement follows Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s visit to Kabul last week, when he discussed counterterrorism efforts and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement with his Afghan counterpart, Sirajuddin Haqqani.
Naqvi had expressed concerns over the infiltration by terrorist organisations causing “chaos and instability” and the need to stop them.
Islamabad accuses Afghan-based terror groups of launching cross-border attacks and planning and executing terrorist attacks here, facilitated by the Afghan Taliban administration’s indifference to Pakistan’s concerns. In response, Pakistan has conducted military strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan and initiated a mass deportation drive targeting Afghan nationals.
In April, Afghanistan’s acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had assured Pakistan that Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.
Dar invites diaspora to contribute to Pakistan’s development
During the interaction in New York, Dar stated that Pakistan was experiencing a significant positive boost in its standing on the world stage, saying it had emerged from a period of diplomatic isolation and is witnessing economic revival.
“We have made considerable progress, especially in political and economic fields, in the past three years, despite heavy odds. We are indeed a resilient nation,” he said. Dar underscored that Pakistan was actively engaging on the international stage, including through recent high-level visits and multilateral diplomacy.
He invited the diaspora to actively contribute to Pakistan’s development, particularly in investment, trade, education, and digital innovation. He appreciated the contributions of the Pakistani diaspora to both Pakistan and the United States, acknowledging their vital role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing Pakistan’s image globally.
 
 

The foreign minister informed the community gathering on Pakistan’s economic recovery, noting that the country had successfully completed the IMF programme, significantly reduced inflation, and restored investor confidence.
Sharing that global credit rating agencies had recently acknowledged Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook, he reaffirmed the government’s aspiration for Pakistan to join the ranks of G-20 economies.
He outlined key initiatives of the government, particularly the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), designed to streamline investment procedures and unlock opportunities in priority sectors.
Dar assured the community that the government was actively working toward the early resumption of PIA flights to New York, including steps toward restoring routes to Europe and the United Kingdom.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to engaging the Pakistani-American diaspora as strategic partners in national development as well as in strengthening mutually beneficial Pakistan–US bilateral cooperation.
‘Pakistan to defend sovereignty’
Speaking to the Pakistani community in New York, FM Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and regional stability.
He recalled the country’s firm and resolute response during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos that led to the downing of six Indian aircraft, praising the unity demonstrated by the nation and the diaspora during this critical moment.
He appreciated the solidarity and support extended by Pakistani-Americans during the recent tensions with India and their constructive role in amplifying the voice of the Kashmiri people.
 
 

The government termed its retaliatory operation against India as ‘Bunyan-un- Marsoos’ after Pakistan and India clashed in May. After India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan’s military swiftly responded and downed 6 Indian jets before a ceasefire came into effect following US mediation.
The foreign minister also visited Washington, DC days ago, where he held a “cordial” meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “The meeting went very well. We discussed key global and regional issues,” he said, expressing hope that bilateral ties would be further strengthened.
Rubio had lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Dar.</p><small>2025-07-27 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2717093691b37d4.jpg?r=171004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926916/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-malaysian-mediation-malaysian-minister-says' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand and Cambodia agree to Malaysian mediation, Malaysian minister says</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to Malaysia acting as a mediator in their border conflict, the Malaysian foreign minister said on Sunday, as the combatants each said the other had launched further artillery attacks across contested areas.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai are expected in Malaysia on Monday evening, Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told state news agency Bernama.
“They have full confidence in Malaysia and asked me to be a mediator,” Mohamad said, adding he had talked with his Cambodian and Thai counterparts and they agreed no other country should be involved in the issue.
The talks in Malaysia come after Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, chair of the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) forum, had proposed a ceasefire on Friday and US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the two leaders had agreed to work on a ceasefire.
 
 

Four days after the worst fighting in more than a decade broke out between the Southeast Asian neighbours, the death toll stood above 30, including 13 civilians in Thailand and eight in Cambodia. More than 200,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the two countries, authorities said.
Fresh artillery clashes erupted on Sunday morning near two long-contested ancient temples in the frontier region between northern Cambodia and northeast Thailand, which has seen the bulk of the fighting.
Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said Thai forces began attacking areas around the temples at 4:50am (6:50am PKT).
The regular thump of artillery rattled windows in the Cambodian town of Samraong, around 20 kilometres from the frontline, AFP journalists said.
Thai Army Deputy Spokesman Ritcha Suksuwanon said Cambodian forces began firing artillery around 4am (6am PKT) as the two sides battled for control of strategic positions.
Ceasefire calls
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Sunday said his country “agreed with the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between the two armed forces”.
He said his Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn will talk to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to coordinate with the Thais, but warned Bangkok against reneging on any agreement.
After Trump’s call, Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said he had agreed in principle to enter a ceasefire and start talks “as soon as possible”.
While both sides have expressed a desire for talks to end the crisis, neither has so far been willing to back down. On Sunday, they again each blamed the other for undermining peace efforts.
The Thai foreign ministry also accused Cambodian forces of firing shells into civilian homes in Surin province.
“Any cessation of hostilities cannot be reached while Cambodia is severely lacking in good faith and repeatedly violating the basic principles of human rights and humanitarian law,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
From the Cambodian side, defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata issued a statement denying that they fired first.
The statement accused Thailand of “deliberate and coordinated acts of aggression”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into combat this week with jets, tanks and ground troops battling in the rural border region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and agricultural land where locals farm rubber and rice.
Thailand says seven of its soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.
The conflict has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, and 80,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted “an immediate ceasefire” and a peaceful resolution of the dispute.
UN chief Antonio Guterres urged both sides on Saturday to “immediately agree to a ceasefire” and hold talks to find a lasting solution.
As well as blaming each other for starting the fight, Cambodia has also accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions, while Thailand has accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours over their shared 800-kilometre border, where dozens of kilometres are contested.</p><small>2025-07-27 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616012-miftah-ismail-rebuffs-wfp-contracts-allegations-warns-of-legal-action' target='_blank'><strong>Miftah Ismail rebuffs WFP contracts allegations, warns of legal action</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Floods swept across GB on Monday, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said flood-related incidents in the region have claimed 10 lives since Monday, when four were killed and 15 went missing in Babusar.
The toll in Babusar has risen to seven, while two deaths were reported from Diamer’s Thore Valley and another from the Astore district, Faraq added.
The body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. “The body could be that of one of the tourists swept away at the Babusar Highway,” he said.
While speaking about the search operation yesterday, Faraq had said there may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at Babusar valley.
“Search operations are underway on Babusar Highway by personnel of the Pakistani Army, district administration and other institutions,” he said, adding that rescue and relief operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit.
 


Most tourists trapped in Ferry Meadows have been rescued and moved to a safe place, Faraq said, adding that the Silk Road had been restored for all types of traffic.
“At least Rs20 billion worth of damage has been caused by flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan,” he said.
“The province runs on grants and aid; it will be difficult redressal for the provincial government alone. The federal government should announce a separate reasonable grant for the relief of flood disasters.”
A day earlier, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters that approximately “caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.”
He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.
The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.
He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p><small>2025-07-27 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616008-govt-bans-road-travel-to-iraq-iran-for-arbaeen-amid-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan bars by-road travel to Iran, Iraq for Arbaeen amid security concerns this year</strong></a><br><p>
