A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
 
 

Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
Earlier today, Indian news outlet First Post reported that per CNN-News 18, top intelligence sources said “Pakistan is preparing to deploy up to 20,000 troops to Gaza after Field Marshal Asim Munir held secret meetings with senior officials from Israel’s Mossad and America’s CIA.”
It further said sources told CNN-News 18 that the role of Pakistani troops’ would allegedly include “neutralising remaining Hamas elements and stabilising the territory under Western instructions”.
The report added that Pakistani troops would “act as a buffer force between Israel and Gaza’s remaining armed factions, providing a security umbrella while facilitating reconstruction and institutional restructuring”, according to sources.
“In exchange for such a deployment, Israel and the United States have promised Pakistan a package of economic incentives, including World Bank loan leniency, deferred repayment schedules, and financial support routed through Gulf intermediaries, sources said.”
Since the news spread, politicians and journalists alike expressed concern and criticism over the idea, sharing their thoughts on social media.
Responding to the matter in a post on X, the information ministry said: “The news item is completely fabricated. No such meetings, understandings, or ‘deals’ ever took place between Pakistan’s leadership, CIA or Mossad.
“Pakistan does not recognise Israel, has no diplomatic or military engagement with it, and maintains a clear, principled stance in support of Palestinian self-determination.”
It further said that neither the military’s media wing nor any credible Pakistani or international source had issued or verified any plan for military deployment in Gaza.
It slammed CNN-News 18 as an outlet with a “history of publishing anti-Pakistan disinformation, including multiple unverified ‘intelligence source’ stories in the past”.
The ministry said the entire story was a “manufactured propaganda piece” with no factual or institutional basis. It added that Pakistan had not proposed, agreed or discussed any troop deployment to Gaza.
“The claim of a CIA–Mossad–Munir deal and Pakistan sending 20,000 troops to Gaza is a deliberate fabrication aimed at misrepresenting Pakistan’s foreign policy and tarnishing its image among Muslim nations. Such false narratives appear designed to sow distrust and stir regional polarisation.”
 






The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility. Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counterterrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment. “Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.</p><small>2025-10-28 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281122278c2c4c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951752/9-nccia-officials-booked-for-extorting-money-from-ducky-bhais-family-6-remanded-in-fia-custody' target='_blank'><strong>9 NCCIA officials booked for ‘extorting money’ from Ducky Bhai’s family; 6 remanded in FIA custody</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore court approved on Tuesday the Federal Investigation Agency’s request, granting it a three-day physical remand of six National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes.
The first information report (FIR) of the case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered a total of nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials, at 7:35pm yesterday. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest yesterday.
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of another official nominated in the case — Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director of operations in Islamabad — have also been unknown for several days.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials about whom it emerged yesterday that they had been arrested by the FIA.
They were presented before a district court in Lahore today.
The officials were brought to the court in handcuffs.
At the hearing, the FIA sought their physical remand from Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo for further investigation.
“The suspects have to be interrogated,” the FIA’s lawyer contended.
“Till now, what have you found during the probe, on the basis of which you arrested the officials?” Justice Wattoo enquired.
The FIA’s lawyer replied that the probe was still under way.
For his part, the officials’ lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said details should be shared about the number of FIRs registered against the suspects.
At that, the FIA informed the court that the officials were nominated in just one FIR.
Following that, Ashfaq contended as per NCCIA rules, any action against an 18-grade officer was to be initiated after the director general’s permission. “Sarfraz is an officer, and permission has not been sought from the NCCIA for action against him.”
He further argued that when Aroob Jatoi had “given a bribe”, why did the FIA not register a case against him. On the other hand, a case against the NCCIA officials was registered within 20 minutes, he said.
According to the FIA’s application submitted in the court, a copy of which was seen by Dawn.com, the officials were arrested on October 27.
The agency sought a 14-day physical remand of the officials, as per the document. However, after arguments by lawyers from both sides and reserving its verdict, the court granted the FIA physical custody of the officials for three days.
Judge Wattoo ordered the FIA to present the NCCIA officials before the court on October 31 (Friday).
“There is material at this stage against accused Shoaib Riaz Muhammad Sarfaraz Chaudhary in the shape of a private person’s complaint, statement and detail of cheques, amount etc, which shows that further remand should be given for recovery and completion of investigation of first group of accused,” the order read.
Referring to the FIA’s request regarding the “second group of accused Zawar Ahmad, Ali Raza, Yasir Ramzan and Mujtaba Zaffar”, the judge noted: “Statements are on record in which detail is mentioned that how much amount and when it was collected and how it was paid as illegal gratification to high-ups.
“Said entitles at this stage to give remand to probe further. It looks [like a] deep-rooted matter,” the order said, adding that the investigation officer’s contentions to the extent of the second group of suspects were also plausible.
Application seeking officials’ court production
Before the hearing, another lawyer representing the six NCCIA officials, Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq, had submitted an application to the judicial magistrate, seeking his clients’ production before the court.
The application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the officials had been formally arrested by the FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle.
“Since their arrest, neither the family nor the legal counsels are allowed to meet with the suspects; so much so, FIA officials have also refused to issue [a] copy of [the] first information report (FIR) in which the aforementioned suspects’ arrest has been caused, which is a glaring violation of all the settled norms and principles of fair investigation and fair trial as guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and also the violation of Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002; as well as different standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the department,” the application read.
It highlighted that the relevant investigating officer or investigation agency was bound to produce arrested individuals before the competent court within the first 24 hours of detention.
“However, in a design, and manner, the suspects are arrested, kept and not being allowed to meet with family members as well as their legal counsels, it is seriously apprehended that the suspects may not be produced before this honorable court which equates to illegal confinement for a longer period and such action on part of [the] investigation officer is a sheer violation of Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002.
“That the above highlighted unlawful actions, on part of the police, are not only violative of Articles 4, 9, 10, 10A, 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with respect to right of individuals to be dealt in accordance with law etc., security/ liberty of person, safeguards [against] arrest and detention, right to fair trial, protection against self-incrimination and inviolability of dignity of man etc., but also very inhuman as being against the basic human rights,” the application stated.
It added that courts were the “guardian[s] of liberty of citizens and the abuse of power to rope innocent people in order to humiliate them should equally be kept under scrutiny and such unlawful actions should be curbed”. The application further mentioned that the right of liberty was one of the “most precious rights”, which had been guarded by the Constitution and courts.
In the application, the lawyer sought the court’s directives for the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore deputy director and the FIA director for Lahore to produce the NCCIA officers before it at the earliest in the “supreme interest of justice, equity and fairplay”.
FIR against NCCIA officials
Meanwhile, it emerged late last night that the NCCIA officials had been nominated in an FIR registered on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi.
Apart from the six officials in the FIA custody and Islamabad NCCIA’s Muhammad Usman, Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan and a person named Salman Aziz have also been nominated in the case.
The FIR has been registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
 
 

The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9m” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August 2025, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Salman Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen had been assigned the investigation of the case.
Controversies and transfer
Among the six NCCIA arrested officers, Additional Director Sarfraz was reportedly removed over different controversies last month and asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
The three controversies were about laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai and Rajab Butt, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and online gambling apps.
 
 

The other was the registration of a case against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA. The third controversy related to a tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving deputy inspector general of police and some other police officials, as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter. According to an official, Chaudhry was transferred in light of different complaints against him.
When approached for comment previously, an NCCIA spokesperson had declined to comment on the missing officers, terming it a “serious matter”.
However, sources had told Dawn that the officers’ disappearance was linked to their investigations into social media influencers and their financial crimes.
On Friday, the Islamabad High Court had granted the police one more week to trace missing NCCIA Deputy Director Muhammad Usman, who has been missing for several days. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
The court was also informed that the petitioner had herself gone missing after initiating the case. The development had prompted the court to seek an updated report from the police on both disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-28 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/281931528503e14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951789/indian-national-charged-with-assault-of-2-teens-on-flight-from-chicago-us-justice-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Indian national charged with assault of 2 teens on flight from Chicago: US justice dept</strong></a><br><p>An Indian national was charged with an assault on a flight travelling from Chicago to Germany, according to a press release issued by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday.
The DoJ stated that Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork and was arrested on October 25 after the flight was diverted to Boston. He was charged in the US District Court with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm.
“According to the charging documents, on October 25, 2025, while on board Lufthansa flight 431 en route from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, Usiripalli allegedly stabbed a 17-year-old male passenger (Minor A) in the shoulder area with a metal fork,” the statement read. “Usiripalli then allegedly stabbed a second 17-year-old male passenger (Minor B) in the back of the head with the same metal fork.”
The DoJ said that when flight crew members attempted to subdue Usiripalli, he reportedly raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger.
“Immediately afterwards, Usiripalli allegedly turned toward a female passenger to his left and slapped her with his hand. Usiripalli also allegedly attempted to slap a flight crew member,” the statement read.
“As a result of the disturbance, the flight was diverted to Boston Logan International Airport, where Usiripalli was immediately taken into custody.”
The department added that while Usiripalli was admitted to the US on a student visa, it added that he presently does not have any legal status in the country.
“The charge of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000,” the statement read.</p><small>2025-10-28 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28183125f3b84f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951784/at-least-6-suspects-killed-in-separate-encounters-in-lahore-ccd' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 suspects killed in separate ‘encounters’ in Lahore: CCD</strong></a><br><p>At least six suspects were killed in four separate encounters with the Crime Control Department (CCD) in different locations of Lahore late on Monday, the CCD said on Tuesday.
Earlier this year, the Punjab government launched the CCD with a mandate to tackle organised crime, terrorism, and high-profile criminal gangs. Recently, the body has carried out a range of encounters. Officials have publicly praised the department for its successes, claiming it has “significantly reduced street crime and targeted major criminal figures.”
As per a statement issued by the department’s spokesperson today, “CCD teams conducted four different encounters in Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, Green Town, Harbanspura, and Ring Road, where six suspects were killed.”
In the first instance, in Nishtar Colony, the CCD team came under attack while they were out to arrest the suspects, the statement said.
“An exchange of fire ensued, leaving two suspects dead by their associates’ fire,” the CCD said, adding that the “deceased had been involved in theft, previous encounters with the police, murder, and attempted murder.”
In a separate incident that took place in Green Town, a detained suspect was killed by his own associates, it said, adding that two suspects were killed in an encounter on Ring Road as they were attempting to rob citizens, it added.
The CCD spokesperson said, “The suspects opened fire on the police team. Two were killed while another two managed to escape.”
In the fourth encounter that took place in the Harbasnpura area, one of the suspects died after sustaining severe injuries during an exchange of fire with the police, the statement said.
“The injured suspect was taken to the hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries,” the CCD added.
Rising number of ‘encounters’
The mounting death toll during the encounters has sparked concerns among legal experts and civil society.
On October 14, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep alarm at the “growing normalisation” of police encounters, a pattern it says has become entrenched since the establishment of CCD as a special wing of the Punjab Police in February 2025.
The rights body highlighted that the “trend undermines the rule of law and constitutional guarantees of due process.”
According to data compiled by the HRCP, the province has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province.
Human rights monitors allege that extrajudicial killings are being used as a substitute for the criminal justice system.
Critics argue that the encounters often follow a similar narrative: a suspect is located, they open fire on police, and are subsequently killed in the ensuing shootout, leaving no possibility for arrest, investigation, or trial.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28172419c5b6a92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951779/every-missile-test-pakistan-has-conducted-in-recent-months' target='_blank'><strong>Every missile test Pakistan has conducted in recent months</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has tested multiple missile types over the last few years to increase its defence capabilities and also to ensure credible deterrence. The missiles range from ground-launched cruise missiles to medium-range ballistic missiles.
Fatah 4 cruise missile
On September 30, the Pakistan Army successfully conducted a training launch of a newly inducted, indigenously-produced Fatah-4 cruise missile at a range of 750 kilometres, the military’s media wing said.
“Equipped with advanced avionics and state-of-the-art navigational aids, this weapon system is capable of evading [the] enemy’s missile defence system due to terrain-hugging features and engaging targets with high precision,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.

Fatah surface-to-surface missile
On May 5, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah series surface-to-surface guided missile with a range of 120 kilometres, as part of ‘Ex Indus’, the ISPR said in a statement.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the statement read.

Abdali ballistic missile
Also in May, Pakistan successfully tested the Abdali weapon system, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a reported range of 450 kilometres, the ISPR said.
Like the Fatah missile launched that month, the Abdali was also launched during ‘Ex Indus’.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuverability features,” the ISPR said in a press release.

Ship-launched ballistic missile
Last November, the Pakistan Navy conducted a successful flight test of an indigenously developed ship-launched ballistic missile, the Directorate General Public Relations (Navy) said in a press release.
The SMASH (Supersonic Missile Anti-SHip) missile, with a range of 350-kilometres, is capable of engaging land and sea targets with high precision.
“The missile system is equipped with a state-of-the-art navigation system and manoeuvrability features,” it added.

Shaheen-II
Last August, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-II surface-to-surface ballistic missile, the military’s media affairs wing confirmed.
The ISPR said in a statement that the training launch was aimed at the training of troops, validating various technical parameters, and performance evaluation of different sub-systems incorporated for improved accuracy and enhanced survivability.

The Pakistan Army formed the Rocket Force Command earlier in August to bolster the nation’s defence capabilities. The army’s latest combatant arm was formed following the war with India in May.
The new command will be responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines.
The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger. PM Shehbaz described the force as “equipped with modern technology and having the capability to strike at the enemy from different directions… another milestone in strengthening our conventional warfare capacity.”</p><small>2025-10-28 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2816440869cd60e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951774/pakistan-saudi-arabia-launch-economic-cooperation-framework-to-bolster-trade-and-development' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia launch Economic Cooperation Framework to bolster trade and development</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday launched the Economic Cooperation Framework, which is based on their shared economic interests and reaffirms their desire to strengthen trade and investment relations.
The decision to launch the framework was taken during a Monday meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
The FII9 convened global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, ‘The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth’ and discuss key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
“As part of the framework, several strategic and high-impact projects will be discussed in the economic, trade, investment and development fields that will contribute to strengthening cooperation between the two governments, enhancing the pivotal role of the private sector, and increasing trade exchange between the two countries,” the statement read.
It added that the deal would prioritise sectors including energy, industry, mining, information technology, tourism, agriculture and food security. Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries and cooperation in the energy field.
“This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.
Celebrating the announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said: “Another historic chapter unfolds in Pakistan-Saudi relations.”
He said the developed marked a “high point” in the partnership between the two countries, strengthening trade, energy and investment ties.
 






Discussion at Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative

Participating in a discussion at the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was rich in resources. He said “very honest mistakes” were made in the country’s history but it had learnt from them.
“Important thing is to learn from your mistakes and that is what we are doing. At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption.
The prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries that were most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the floods of 2022 and this year.
“This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards. It has to be mutual cooperation,” he said, adding that loans alone were not the solution.
The premier said that if humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”.
He said his government would turn Pakistan around with untiring efforts and making the best of its available resources.
PM Shehbaz also said that Pakistan was fast moving towards the increasing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter.
He said the global north and the global south should sit down and come to an agreement on the equitable distribution of resources for an egalitarian economy for all.
FM Dar meets Saudi counterpart
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with his Saudi counterpart, Faisal bin Farhan al Saud, in Riyadh to discuss bilateral relations, regional and international developments, according to the FO.
The pair also discussed the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and “reaffirmed their shared commitment to cooperation at multilateral fora, including the United Nations”, according to a post on X by the FO.
“They agreed to further deepen the Pak-Saudi multifaceted partnership across all domains, and to continue strengthening the bonds of brotherhood and friendship between the two countries,” the post read.
 






Pak-Saudi relationship
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Last month, the two nations signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
A statement from the PM’s office announced the signing of the pact during a meeting at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace, which stated that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an act of aggression against both”.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement read.

Addressing a dinner with business leaders during his trip to Japan, Trump claimed that a lot of the wars he stopped were because of his tariffs imposed on multiple countries, stating that he did “a great service to the world”.
“If you look at India and Pakistan, they were going at it,” he said. “Seven brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down.
“I said to [Indian] Prime Minister Modi and I said to the Prime Minister [Shehbaz Sharif], very nice man, a very good man and the Field Marshal [Asim Munir] over in Pakistan … I said, ‘look we’re not going to do any trade if you’re going to be fighting’,” Trump said.
“We said ‘no, we’re not doing any deals if you’re going to fight’ and within 24 hours that was the end of that. It was amazing, actually,” he added. “I think trade is responsible for 70 per cent of the fact that we didn’t have wars.”
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630951-pm-shehbaz-addresses-future-investment-conference-in-riyadh' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan suffered economic losses worth $130bn from climate disasters, says PM at FII9 conference</strong></a><br><p>

The CM shared this information while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, where he was also asked what the two had discussed during the meeting.
“He came to congratulate me, and it was not an official [exchange]. The conversation was unofficial. And our stance is the same [everywhere], what we say inside is what we say outside,” Afridi replied.
 






Responding to a follow-up question, he further explained that he was the chief executive of a province and even the inspector general of police and the chief secretary had visited his office. Similarly, he continued, “the corps commander will also come there, and the officers of all of our security institutions will also come. We will discuss matters pertaining to the province with them.”
Apparently referring to security officials, he said they should visit the chief ministers and the prime minister’s office instead of the office holders going to them.
The CM also stressed that his government’s stance would be the same as that of the PTI and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
Imran, who was has been in jail since 2023, had blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for an alleged conspiracy that resulted in his ouster as the prime minister via a no-confidence vote in April 2022.
Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
Meanwhile, several PTI supporters have also been facing military trials and convictions following violent protests on May 9, 2023, over Imran’s arrest, during which civilian and military properties and installations were vandalised.
The PTI has also been opposing military operations in KP, even though Afridi’s immediate predecessor as the provincial chief executive, Ali Amin Gandapur, had deviated from the party line in the past and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military.
Gandapur was removed as the CM earlier this month on Imran’s directive while the PTI had named Afridi as his potential replacement. Later, Afridi was elected as the CM on October 13.
Three days before his election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership.
In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations?
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
Regarding another question about the change in KP leadership and how it might signal a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR stated that the establishment is itself a part of the state.
“Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’
‘Courts held hostage’
Speaking outside the SC today, KP CM Afridi alleged that courts had been “held hostage” since April 9, 2022, when Imran was ousted as the premier.
“We are firmly standing alongside the judges who want to deliver justice,” he said, regretting that a superintended was disregarding judges’ directives — an apparent reference to relevant authorities not allowing him to meet Imran in jail despite court orders.
He said his name was in the visitor’s list for Imran today, adding that if he was denied a meeting even today, he would wait for the court’s decision.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28153338111e0e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951771/inside-the-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine' target='_blank'><strong>Inside the Trump family’s global crypto cash machine</strong></a><br><p>Eric Trump, the son of United States President Donald Trump, was in Dubai on family business.
Meeting with a Chinese businessman and his associates on the sidelines of a cryptocurrency conference in May this year, Eric Trump ran through his usual talking points about the inefficiency of traditional banks and his own famous father’s run-ins with financiers.
Then came the pitch. Buy at least $20 million of “governance tokens” in the Trump family’s crypto business, World Liberty Financial, and become part of a venture that Eric Trump predicted would soon embody the future of finance in America, according to a person familiar with the meeting.
To some in that small gathering, the technology Eric Trump’s team described for World Liberty seemed “rudimentary“, the person said. At the time, World Liberty was a fledgling business. It hadn’t yet created the cryptocurrency-based finance platform it promised after its September 2024 launch. It still hasn’t.
Even so, the pitch apparently worked. On June 26, an obscure entity called Aqua1 Foundation, which said it was based in the United Arab Emirates, announced it was buying $100m of cryptocurrency tokens from World Liberty. It was the single largest known purchase of the so-called WLFI tokens at the time.
In April this year, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) partnered with World Liberty Financial to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.
 
 

The Chinese businessman who met with Eric Trump in Dubai was Guren “Bobby” Zhou, who has executive roles in multiple businesses and who is under investigation in Britain for money laundering, according to that nation’s National Crime Agency and a document filed in an immigration case at London’s Royal Courts of Justice.
Zhou did not respond directly to requests for comment for this article.
In a statement emailed to Reuters, an entity calling itself Aqua Labs Investment LLC said Zhou was its co-founder and described itself as an Abu Dhabi entity of Aqua1 Foundation. The statement said Aqua1 Foundation’s investment in World Liberty tokens “was a commercial decision consistent with its focus on advancing regulated, scalable digital-asset ecosystems.” Zhou’s relationship to Aqua1 Foundation has not been previously reported.
Aqua1 Foundation did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did Eric Trump.
The Dubai meeting, reported here for the first time, was just one stop on a globetrotting investment roadshow the two elder sons of President Trump – Eric and Donald Trump Jr. — embarked on around the time of their father’s election to a second term. In Europe, the Middle East and Asia, they have been promoting World Liberty and other ventures that funnel investors’ cash to Trump family businesses, known collectively as the Trump Organisation.
The Trump brothers’ efforts have been a whopping success. In the first half of this year, the Trump Organisation’s income soared 17-fold to $864m from $51m a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on the president’s official disclosures, property records, financial records released in court cases, crypto trade information and other sources. Of the first-half total, $802m — more than 90pc — came from Trump crypto ventures, including sales of World Liberty tokens.
That $864m payday represents actual income — cash flowing, free and clear, into Trump family coffers. Reuters’ calculations were reviewed by half a dozen crypto and real estate experts and a certified accountant who has studied the US Internal Revenue Service’s approach to crypto.
The Trumps’ first-half crypto income dwarfed what the family earned from its traditional businesses — $33m from the president’s golf clubs and resorts and $23m for licensing his name to overseas real estate developers, according to the Reuters estimates.
More than half of the Trumps’ income — $463m — came from sales of World Liberty tokens alone, including up to $75m from Aqua1’s token purchase. On its website, World Liberty says a Trump Organisation entity receives 75 per cent of the revenue from the token sales through its association with World Liberty.
The family also made $336m from sales of a Trump meme coin, $TRUMP, Reuters calculated, using assumptions vetted by five analysts. Due to a lack of transparency in the Trump meme coin business, estimates of income from the coins carry a higher degree of uncertainty than those for WLFI token sales.
The Trumps are minting a trove of hard cash from digital assets backed, so far, by little more than the Trump name. World Liberty tokens, like most crypto products, are registered on digital ledgers called blockchains.
But WLFI tokens offer holders little beyond a limited say in the business’s plans, unlike governance tokens for similar projects. And meme coins like the $TRUMP coin are essentially collectables whose value reflects the popularity of the internet joke, meme or personality associated with them.
World Liberty Financial did not respond directly to requests for comment for this article. In a letter to Reuters, Timothy Parlatore, a lawyer for the company, said: “WLFI tokens are not securities; they are digital assets with real utility, including governance rights that benefit holders as the platform grows.” He also said: “The alleged valuation and income analysis of WLFI is inaccurate and misleading.”
In a subsequent email, Parlatore declined to provide further specifics on the benefits to holders of World Liberty governance tokens or his critique of the Reuters analysis.
The jump in the Trumps’ income represents “a massive pivot” for the family business, said Carter Davis, an assistant professor of finance at The Ohio State University who has studied cryptocurrency pricing and who reviewed the Reuters calculations.
“Even if you go through and you do the most conservative estimate…it’s pretty wild that you end up with such a huge fraction of the income coming from crypto.”
‘Legal but unethical’
The identities of most buyers of the WLFI tokens are hidden behind opaque “wallet” addresses — the unique identifiers investors use as keys to access and manage their holdings.
Among the few major buyers whose identities are known — a mix of foreign and US investors — most have histories of legal and regulatory entanglements related to their business endeavours. And as the Trump brothers’ travels over the past year show, foreign investors have been a major target for token sales.
Reuters interviewed half a dozen foreign crypto entrepreneurs who met with the Trump brothers. Five of them said they sought out the younger Trumps for business opportunities because of their proximity to the 79-year-old president and hopes of cashing in on his political and financial power.
For many other investors, the Trumps’ involvement signalled a chance to capitalise on the family’s name. Dorji Rabten’s Seoul-based venture investment firm, Oddiyana Ventures, bought an undisclosed amount of WLFI tokens in January. Rabten said he never met the Trump sons, but the family’s involvement was central to his investment.
“In the first very moment where we saw the project, we thought it’s going to be very huge, obviously, given the fact it’s a president’s sons taking up that project,” Rabten told Reuters in September.

The alignment of the Trump family’s crypto initiatives with President Trump’s public role as overseer of US crypto policy constitutes a conflict of interest unprecedented in modern presidential history, government ethics experts said.
“These people are not pouring money into coffers of the Trump family business because of the brothers’ acumen,” said Washington University law professor Kathleen Clark, who specialises in government ethics and was commenting on Reuters’ findings. “They are doing it because they want freedom from legal constraints and impunity that only the president can deliver.”
However, the ethicists said, unless the Trump brothers are explicitly promising access to or favourable treatment from the president in their sales pitches, they are breaking no laws. “It’s legal but unethical,” said Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush and is now a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.
None of the more than a dozen people Reuters spoke with who had met with the Trump brothers or their partners recounted any of them explicitly offering presidential access or favours in return for investing in their family businesses.
 
 

The White House has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest, saying that upon taking office, the president ended his involvement in his businesses after placing them in a trust managed by his children.
Still, as a beneficiary of the trust that controls the Trump Organisation, the president will have the money the family is now making at his disposal when he leaves office.
A White House spokeswoman referred Reuters to the Trump Organisation for comment. The Trump Organisation’s chief legal officer did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr.
Parlatore, the World Liberty lawyer, said any suggestion that investments in the firm are motivated by a desire to get closer to President Trump “is a complete lie”. He pointed out that token purchases on secondary markets — as opposed to direct purchases from the company — do not benefit the World Liberty team.
Blurring the line
World Liberty advertises its plans on its website — an app for making crypto deposits, for example, and a crypto-backed borrowing facility. But for now, as a pure business play in a crowded field, it has little to recommend it.
The venture has yet to unveil what it heralded last year as its core business: a peer-to-peer financing platform capable of challenging traditional banks. Since March, its leadership has actively promoted a stablecoin — a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to traditional assets like dollars or gold — called USD1.
While the stablecoin’s name belongs to World Liberty, the coin is issued and supported by another company that pays World Liberty a share of the coin’s profits. The coin’s circulation is dwarfed by that of market leaders.
Further, while WLFI holders can vote on limited governance matters, the platform is not designed to let them award themselves a share of profits. That’s unusual among peer-to-peer crypto lending platforms, according to two academics who study crypto markets and a Reuters review of four of the largest platforms’ terms of business.
In July, holders voted to allow trading of the tokens on crypto exchanges. World Liberty later said that only early buyers would be allowed to sell, capped at no more than 20pc of their tokens. After trading began on September 1, the token price rose from an initial 31 cents to 46 cents and then sank about 65pc three days later. It now trades at around 14 cents.
In his letter to Reuters, Parlatore said broader adoption of the stablecoin and other World Liberty products “directly benefits WLFI governance token holders through established mechanics, which, while complicated, are factual and already operational.”
Asked for details of those mechanics and how they would benefit token holders, he said in a subsequent letter: “Your proposed article is based entirely on false sources and a misinterpretation of basic principles.”
As recently as 2021, Donald J. Trump, speaking to Fox Business, criticised cryptocurrencies as a threat to US dollar supremacy and said bitcoin “seems like a scam“.
Three years later, his take on crypto had changed. Just weeks before the November 2024 presidential election, he kicked off sales of World Liberty tokens with a social media post: “This is YOUR chance to help shape the future of finance,” he wrote.
 






Since Trump’s second inauguration, his administration, reversing many of its predecessor’s positions, has been clearing the way for the crypto industry’s growth in the US. The Justice Department axed its crypto enforcement team.
Regulators scrapped guidance warning banks to be cautious about crypto-related risks. And the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused or dropped lawsuits in high-profile cases against crypto firms.
For its part, World Liberty conveys the impression of a presidential connection.
On the “Meet our team” section of its website, the firm displays a portrait of President Trump, labelling him a “co-founder emeritus.” The other co-founder emeritus shown is Steven Witkoff, a billionaire real estate investor and President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East and for peace missions. (A small footnote says both men were “removed upon taking office.”)
Don Jr., Eric and their younger brother, Barron Trump, are presented as co-founders, as are Witkoff’s two sons, Zach and Alex. Zach Witkoff has been a ubiquitous presence with the Trump brothers as they have travelled the globe to tout tokens.

“Without the Trump name, you wouldn’t see World Liberty Financial raising this kind of money,” said Santa Clara University finance professor Seoyoung Kim, who specialises in crypto analytics. Kim said she saw nothing of particular value in the technologies and services announced by World Liberty, describing its value proposition as “being part of the club.”
The business has transformed the Trump family’s wealth. Thanks to continuing token sales, the Trumps’ crypto income is now approaching and could even exceed $1 billion.
In early August, for example, about three weeks before WLFI began trading, a tiny Nasdaq-listed blockchain services company, Alt5 Sigma, said it had raised $750M from investors to help buy 7.5pc of all World Liberty tokens.
In corporate filings for the deal, Alt5 Sigma said that the $750m came from institutional investors and that almost all of it was used to buy tokens from World Liberty. Based on that information, the Trumps stood to gain about $500m.
“It is an incredibly exciting time,” Eric Trump told Fox Business on August 13, a day after the deal with Alt5 Sigma was finalised.
Since the deal was announced, Alt5 Sigma’s share price has dropped by 75pc. That decline did not affect the cash the Trumps have already made from the deal.

The Trumps’ cash income from crypto doesn’t even include the value of the vast crypto assets the family has amassed in the past year.
Those assets include $TRUMP meme coins and World Liberty tokens, the family still holds. They also include shares in publicly listed Trump Media & Technology Group, which runs Trump’s social-media platform Truth Social and has expanded into crypto.
These holdings are vulnerable to wild price swings, are at risk of price collapse if major holders sell, and can be subject to restrictions on sales and transfers. Nonetheless, they carry an estimated value that — on paper, at least — could add more than $11bn to the family’s fortune.
The foreign element
World Liberty began selling WLFI tokens in October last year to both US and foreign investors. But initial sales in the US were slow.
SEC rules gave only wealthy investors access to the tokens, which shut out small retail buyers who might have wanted to buy them as supporters of the president, as they have done with scores of other products licensed by the Trump Organisation, from Trump-endorsed bibles to sneakers to electric guitars.
Soon, as President-elect Trump’s second term approached, World Liberty was at risk of losing access to the foreign buyers who were sustaining token sales.
The family’s self-imposed ethical guidelines for Trump’s first term prohibited them from seeking new business outside the US. Then, days before his second inauguration, the Trump Organisation released revised guidelines that jettisoned that constraint.
That worked.
In a review conducted for Reuters of the 50 wallets holding the largest amount of World Liberty tokens as of September 15, crypto analytics firm Nansen found that 36 wallets — with holdings valued at $804m — were likely connected to overseas buyers. Only four wallets were connected to US investors, amounting to $889m.
But most of that amount, $781m, was held by Alt5 Sigma; an additional $35m was held by a World Liberty security adviser. Nansen was unable to determine whether the remaining 10 wallets were connected to Americans or foreigners based on blockchain data at the time of analysis.
Parlatore, the World Liberty lawyer, said that more foreigners than Americans have bought crypto because there are more of them, and that crypto has higher penetration rates outside the US.
He added: “It was basically harder to sell WLFI tokens to American investors, especially initially, as the rules were very restrictive in the last administration when the token sale began.”
Among the largest buyers of the tokens is Justin Sun, a Hong Kong-based crypto billionaire. The SEC in 2023 charged Sun with fraud, selling unregistered crypto securities and hiding payments to celebrities to promote his products.
With Trump back in the White House, the commission paused the case in February, just weeks after Sun announced he had increased his total purchases of World Liberty tokens to $75m. Under the terms of World Liberty’s cash distribution agreement with its co-founders, Sun’s token purchases would have sent $56m to the Trump family.
Justin Sun did not respond to a request for comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. The investigation remains paused.
Foreign interests juiced the Trump family’s income through the World Liberty USD1 stablecoin, too.
In May, MGX, a state-controlled Abu Dhabi investment company, used the coin to buy a $2bn equity stake in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. The deal still accounts for three-quarters of all USD1 coins in circulation, though World Liberty has cited it as evidence of “extraordinary, worldwide demand” for the stablecoin.

The board chairman of MGX is Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s national security adviser and a brother of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed. The $2bn MGX paid to create the stablecoins is held in cash equivalents such as US Treasury securities.
World Liberty says on its website that those securities kick off interest payments to some of its affiliates, including one 38pc-owned by the Trump Organisation. That income stream of about $80m annually could yield millions for the Trumps this year, based on Reuters calculations, though, because of the lack of public reporting, it’s not possible to know the final figure.
The deal sparked criticism of what was widely viewed as an egregious conflict of interest. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley asked the Office of Government Ethics to launch an inquiry, warning that MGX’s purchase using the stablecoin “may violate the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution”, which prohibits officeholders from receiving payments or presents from foreign governments.
Eric Ueland, the Trump-appointed acting head of the Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency in the executive branch, did not respond to a request for comment.
In response to a follow-up request to the ethics office’s spokesperson, Reuters received an automated message: “Due to a lapse in appropriations,” a reference to the US government shutdown, “I will be unable to process requests or respond to inquiries.”
An MGX spokesperson referred Reuters to a previous statement which said the company chose USD1 after evaluating several stablecoins, “examining such factors as business suitability, the jurisdiction and currency of assets backing the stablecoin, and compliance history.”
It noted that the stablecoin purchase did not constitute an investment in World Liberty and that MGX used the stablecoin to complete a transaction in which the seller had requested use of cryptocurrency.
MGX’s stablecoin investment also represented a turnabout for Binance in the US — from criminal convictions two years ago to a role in a deal that financially benefits the US president.
In late 2023, the exchange pleaded guilty in federal court to failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program and paid a penalty of $4.3bn. Its billionaire founder, China-born Changpeng Zhao, served nearly four months in prison after pleading guilty to the same charge and stepped down as CEO, but kept his Binance stake.
In May, shortly after the announcement that MGX was using the Trump stablecoin to invest in Binance, Zhao told a podcaster that he had applied for a pardon from the Trump administration but had never spoken to the president.
Last week, the White House announced that President Trump had pardoned Zhao, saying that the previous administration of ex-president Joe Biden “severely damaged the United States’ reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation“.
After the pardon was announced, Zhao posted on social media that he was grateful to the president and would “do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto“.
Zhao was appointed as a strategic adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council in April, just within a month of its launch.
 
 

Reuters could not determine whether World Liberty had any contact with Binance before the latter accepted MGX’s investment using USD1 stablecoins.
The White House did not respond to Reuters’ questions about whether the stablecoin deal and Zhao’s pardon were connected.
MGX said it “did not seek or receive assurances from any party outside the ordinary course of business for such a transaction.” The Trump family and its business representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
Binance and Zhao did not respond to requests for comment.
In a letter to Reuters before the pardon was announced, their lawyers said Binance and Zhao are “clear” that they “conducted themselves entirely properly with regard to the MGX investment” and that “any suggestion that the MGX investment, or the use of USD1 for it, might in any way be linked to any request Mr Zhao might make for a Presidential pardon, would be wholly without foundation.”
They said their clients “did not control the payment method chosen by MGX for its investment in Binance.”
Rolling out the red carpet
The perception that Trump family businesses could provide a path to the president was on display on April 27, when Donald Trump Jr. landed at the airport in Sofia, Bulgaria.
He descended the stairs from a Gulfstream business jet to a red carpet on the tarmac and was whisked away in a long motorcade of black vehicles.
It wasn’t a state visit. It was a stop on a tour of Eastern European capitals where Don Jr. attended a series of conferences titled “Trump Business Vision 2025.”
The Sofia event was sponsored by Nexo, a crypto firm based in the Cayman Islands that left the US market after the SEC fined it $45m for offering an unregistered securities product.
As the conference in Sofia got under way, Antoni Trenchev, Nexo’s co-founder and a former member of the Bulgarian National Assembly, joined Don Jr. on stage. During the event, Trenchev announced that Nexo intended to resume operations in the US.
In a statement sent to Reuters, Nexo said the announcement “was not linked to Mr. Trenchev’s interactions with Donald Trump Jr. or the President of the United States.”
The company also said it does not have a confirmed timeline for returning to the US, but pointed out that “the regulatory environment has begun to shift.”
By early July, Nexo had strengthened its ties to the Trump family.
That month, Nexo became a lead sponsor of a golf championship held at a Trump-owned golf course near Aberdeen, Scotland. A few weeks later, President Trump hosted Trenchev over lunch at his Scottish golf resort, where the two discussed politics and their “joint vision for crypto in the US” during a day on the links, as Trenchev later posted on X with a picture of him and the president.
“Thank you sincerely for what you are doing for all of us,” Trenchev wrote, tagging the US president’s X handle.
Nexo said its sponsorship of the Scottish event was part of a broader partnership with Europe’s leading golf tour. The company said its financial contribution to the partnership was eight figures but declined to be more specific. It also said it did not know what portion of its contribution, if any, would go to the Trump family.
A source familiar with the matter said Nexo agreed to pay about $10m under the three-year deal.
A checkered history
On May 1, four days after Don Jr. received a red carpet welcome in Sofia, his brother Eric took the stage in Dubai with World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff at a crypto conference called TOKEN2049.
There, they announced the MGX stablecoin deal and excoriated the traditional banking system as antiquated and broken. “We are going to transform the financial world,” Eric told the crowd.
 


Acting as a moderator was Justin Sun. At the time, he was the largest known investor in World Liberty tokens. That would soon change. Hours before walking on stage, Eric Trump had made his pitch for buying World Liberty tokens to Guren “Bobby” Zhou and a few other crypto enthusiasts.
Zhou had recently served as chairman of the UAE offices of a British Virgin Islands-registered crypto firm called Web3Port. He brought with him to the meeting a checkered legal history.
Before moving to the UAE, Zhou lived in Britain, where he was arrested in 2021 under suspicion of money laundering, according to a February 2024 court judgment in a separate case involving his UK immigration status.
The judgment says Zhou denied any wrongdoing.
Britain’s National Crime Agency, which passed the case to prosecutors in 2022, confirmed to Reuters that Zhou remains under investigation.
Additionally, in three separate civil cases between 2017 and 2023, Zhou and a family member were found by Chinese courts to have failed to repay loans totalling 19.4m yuan (about $2.4m at current exchange rates), according to court judgments reviewed by Reuters. One of those judgments notes that Zhou failed to appear in court and was tried in absentia.
Zhou did not respond to requests for comment. The Aqua Labs statement said: “Any allegations of wrongdoing contained in recent media enquiries are entirely false. Mr Guren (“Bobby”) Zhou has never been convicted of any financial crime in any jurisdiction, and any implication to the contrary is defamatory and false.”
Reuters could not determine whether Eric Trump was aware of those details when the two met. Parlatore, the World Liberty lawyer, noted that primary sales of World Liberty tokens are subject to review, but did not respond to questions about the vendors the company uses or what steps it takes beyond an initial check of buyers’ identities.
About a month after Zhou met with Eric Trump, in mid-June, Web3Port’s BVI entities changed their names, adopting “Aqua1” in place of “Web3Port”, according to local government records.
 






Just days later, on June 26, Aqua1 Foundation announced its $100m purchase of World Liberty tokens.
 






Then, on June 30, the host of a livestream chat on X out of the UAE started talking about the excitement surrounding Aqua1.
And “guess what,” the host said, there was “a special guest from Aqua1 Foundation” on the line.
That guest was Zhou, who said, “We’re very proud to be, you know, a major player in the World Liberty, which is Trump’s family’s crypto venture.”

Citizens reported sighting the phenomenon around morning prayers from many parts of Balochistan and speculation was rife about the likely cause.
Many social media accounts hinted that the cloud formation was the result of a missile test or a new technology tested by the military.
In a post on X later in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said the sight was a “lenticular cloud formation” which was observed early morning over Koh-i-Murdar region.
“The cloud appeared before sunrise, persisted for approximately 20 minutes, and dissipated just prior to sunrise.”
 






As per the United Kingdom’s Met Office, lenticular clouds are lens-shaped orographic wave clouds that are formed when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.
“These strange, unnatural-looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains … They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO (unidentified flying object) sightings across the world,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-28 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28181758f6c1437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951778/multan-sultans-look-to-ease-tensions-with-pcb-send-proposal-for-stronger-psl' target='_blank'><strong>Multan Sultans look to ease tensions with PCB, send proposal for ‘stronger’ PSL</strong></a><br><p>Amid recent tensions between Multan Sultans and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the PSL franchise on Tuesday submitted a proposal to the PCB aimed at strengthening the Pakistan Super League “through better governance, transparency, and partnership”, according to a statement.
The letter to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi “acknowledges recent tensions but frames this as an opportunity to rebuild trust and put professional systems in place so the PSL can reach its full potential.”
 






According to the statement, Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen reaffirmed the franchise’s long-standing commitment to the league.
The letter notes concerns about ad hoc decision-making and limited management experience, and calls for institutional processes and accountability, the statement read.
Four key reforms were proposed by Multan Sultans, beginning with franchise representation on PSL committees and working groups.
“Formal inclusion of every franchise so policies reflect the league’s collective experience across scheduling, recruitment, ticketing, marketing, and match-day operations,” the statement said, requesting the establishment of a “structured way for franchises to add value to each part of the PSL’s planning and implementation.”
The second reform was on structured hiring for key PSL roles. “Franchise participation in defining roles, vetting candidates, and providing input prior to selection to improve merit-based recruitment and professional standards.
“The PSL has the ability to attract top regional talent and should not have to rely primarily on current or former PCB employees.”
Multan Sultans called for ‘professional management structure’ in their third reform, suggesting “a clear organisational chart with defined departments for operations, marketing, fan engagement, player affairs, and finance, led by a qualified executive team.
The fourth and final reform was aimed at ‘regular reporting to franchises’.
“Monthly meetings on fixed dates with agendas circulated in advance, minutes recorded and shared, and action points tracked across finances, operations, marketing, ticketing, player affairs, and fan engagement.
“This will increase accountability and collaboration,” the statement read.
According to Multan Sultans, the proposal emphasises “partnership over control and aligns all stakeholders around the shared goal of building a globally respected league for Pakistan and its fans.
“After a successful decade, Multan Sultans feel it is time to take the PSL to the next level,” the statement concluded.
The development comes after the franchise, and more specifically Tareen, has been embroiled in a saga with the PCB.
Tareen hit out at Pakistan Super League management late on Thursday stating he was “unhappy at their mediocre mindset” after his franchise was issued a legal notice threatening suspension over breach of contractual obligations.
Earlier that day, the PSL management had acted following repeated public statements by Tareen criticising the PCB and PSL, and had sought a public apology if the latter wished to avoid legal proceedings.
 
 

Tareen then posted a video on social media platform X on Thursday night, in which he could be seen holding what seemed to be the legal notice sent by the PSL management, saying he wanted to apologise but demanded better of the league organisers.
Making sharp remarks targeted the PSL management, he ended the video by tearing up what seemed to be the legal notice he had received.
In a post on X today, Tareen wrote: “Even though tearing the notice was quite satisfying, it’s time to move forward.
“In recognition of the PSL as a national asset, we’re putting grievances aside and aiming for a fresh relationship with the board. One built on transparency, cooperation and trust.

A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake law degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC last year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s degree.
Today, a two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Soomro, took up a miscellaneous application filed by the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) seeking to become a party in the matter.
During the proceedings, Justice Soomro recused himself from hearing the case, following which the bench stood dissolved, and the hearing was adjourned without any further proceedings.
His decision comes after a division bench hearing a writ petition filed by Advocate Mian Daw­o­­od, which questioned the legitimacy of Jus­ti­­ce Jahangiri’s LLB degree, was reconstituted. Justice Mohammad Azam Khan was previously part of the bench led by Justice Dogar.
 
 

It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, as well as of two other judges — Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the IHC.
In its application, the IBA argued that fair and transparent adjudication of the pending writ petition would be impossible without hearing the bar as a party, since the issues involved are of “fundamental importance” to the legal fraternity and the rule of law.
The lawyers’ body emphasised that under its Memorandum of Association (2016), it is mandated to safeguard the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and civil liberties. It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter.
The plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct.
“The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated.
Case developments
On September 16, a division bench comprising Justices Dogar passed an interim order restraining Justice Jahan­giri from performing his judicial functions.
The judge then filed an appeal against the decision before the Supreme Court in person. Subsequently, the restraining order, issued without notice to the respondent, was suspended by a five-member Constitutional Bench of the SC on September 29.
The next day, the bench set aside the IHC ruling, declaring it “null and void”. The bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that no sitting judge could be barred from performing judicial duties through an interim order of a high court.
 
 

Four days earlier, the Sindh High Court (SHC) extended its earlier interim order suspending the KU syndicate’s decision to cancel Justice Jahangiri’s law degree.
A two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro stated that the interim order would continue till November 27 after federal and provincial law officers again sought more time to file comments.
Advocate Mian Dawood’s petition against Justice Jahangiri, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against him — a jurisdiction rarely invoked in such circumstances.
It argues that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from KU — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
 
 

The key allegations in the petition include the use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The KU has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The petition argued that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.</p><small>2025-10-28 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630925-six-nccia-officials-booked-over-bribery-allegation-in-youtuber-ducky-bhai-case-court-told' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber Ducky Bhai case: Six NCCIA officials remanded to FIA custody</strong></a><br><p>

The PML-N and PPP — coalition partners in the federal government — announced yesterday that they will jointly bring about a no-trust motion against AJK Prime Minister Haq.
The PML-N has said it would support the no-trust motion against the AJK premier but would not become part of the government, and instead would be in the opposition. PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira said his party accepted that decision.
Today, Iqbal chaired a meeting of the PML-N’s “political coordination committee” at his planning ministry in Islamabad on the directives of PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Kashmir affairs minister Amir Muqam and Adviser to PM on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah were among the meeting’s participants, while PML-N’s AJK President Shah Ghulam Qadir was leading his parliamentary party.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Iqbal said: “This is proof of great democratic maturity that two major stakeholders are agreeing on bringing a vote of no confidence, considering Kashmir’s political situation and for better governance there.
“And they have also agreed that if one party is part of the government, the other party will play its role in the opposition. This is a sign of a mature democratic system,” he added.
 


“We will also demand that the new government that comes into power conduct independent and fair elections as soon as possible, so that a stable government can be formed in Kashmir through which it can proceed speedily on its journey of progress,” the PML-N leader said.
Iqbal further said that while his party was part of the previous coalition government, it was a “minority stakeholder”, emphasising that the PML-N parliamentary party in AJK had consistently demanded to be “separated from the current government” because of its poor performance.
Iqbal asserted that other stakeholders and parties had also supported the PML-N stance that the “coalition setup was not a solution” to Azad Kashmir’s issues.
Responding to a reporter’s query, Muqam asserted that the agreement signed earlier this month with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) will be implemented, regardless of the government in power.
 
 

Speaking to reporters earlier today, Muqam stated that the PML-N’s decision to be part of the opposition benches in the AJK Legislative Assembly would not hurt ties with the PPP.
“There will be no impact on our relations, the PPP knows this and we do too.”
Asked whether there was a possibility of the PTI and the PPP coming together to form a coalition government in AJK, Muqam said, “There is no such chance.”
Yesterday, a PML-N panel, led by Iqbal and comprising Muqam and Sanaullah, called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss possible options for the formation of the AJK government to be led by the PPP.
Both parties have ratcheted up pressure on the embattled premier to step down from the post, or face a VONC in the region’s legislative assembly.
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members.
The PPP, whose ranks swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the forward bloc joined it on Sunday, can comfortably gather the needed votes with the support of PML-N’s nine members in the assembly.
The PTI has four members, and the Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party each have one member.
In light of this situation, the incumbent PM was reportedly advised to opt for an “honourable exit” by resigning as he had lost the support of the majority. He has three options: dissolve the assembly to prevent the party from coming to power, step down, or face a no-confidence vote.</p><small>2025-10-28 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28141228daedc62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951765/politicians-journalists-question-govts-reported-plan-to-deploy-troops-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Politicians, journalists question govt’s reported plan to deploy troops in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Politicians and journalists on Tuesday raised questions regarding the government’s reported plan of deploying troops in Gaza as part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) currently being assembled.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the government regarding the decision.
Since the news spread, politicians and journalists alike have expressed concern and criticism over the idea, sharing their thoughts on social media.
‘Troubling’, ‘rebranded extension of occupation’
Former senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar called the news “troubling”, saying, “Our ill-thought-out policies of the past are haunting us in the present.”
He added, “Have we discussed and debated its pros and cons? Why is the government hesitant to take the public into confidence?”
 






Meanwhile, Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted a lengthy statement on X in which he expressed “categorical opposition” to the plan, saying that it would enable, rather than end, Israel’s military control of Gaza as a “rebranded extension of occupation, sanitising Israeli aggression through Muslim participation”.
He also pointed out the absence of Palestinian consent to the deployment of foreign troops, saying, “Any such move would violate international law and the core principles of peacekeeping … The people of Gaza would rightly view the ISF not as a stabilising force, but as an imposed foreign presence.”
Nasir added that without a clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the ISF would likely operate under a US-led arrangement that would “strip it of neutrality”. Additionally, he voiced his concern that the plan would divide Arab and Muslim nations into “those willing to cooperate with this flawed framework [and] those who continue to stand firm against Israeli occupation”.
“True and lasting stability in Gaza cannot come from foreign boots on Palestinian soil. It can only emerge from Palestinian-led governance, reconstruction, and reconciliation,” he said, urging the government to refrain from joining the force.
 






‘Who made the decision?’
Opinion Editor of The News International, Zebunnisa Burki, responded to a post by Ryan Rozbiani that pointed out ceasefire violations by Israel in Gaza — killing 150 Palestinians in 16 days —  and asked, “How is this a ceasefire?”
“It’s not,” Burki responded, adding, “And any ‘peacekeeping’ force will also not be keeping any peace, other than helping out Israel.”
 






Journalist Hamid Mir also called attention to a report by Israeli newspaper The Times of Israel about the likely inclusion of Pakistani troops in the ISF, demanding more details and discussion on the matter.
“Why there is a silence on this report?” he asked. “If true, who made this decision? Why [is] this issue not discussed in [the] Pakistani parliament yet?”
 






Former human rights minister and ex-PTI leader Shireen Mazari, in a series of posts, said that the plan would only aid the Israeli occupation by cooperating with the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) under the command of the US and UK.
Mazari posted a photo of the news story published this morning in Dawn with the phrase “cite country’s strong track record in peacekeeping missions” underlined, pointing out, “Pakistan has a strong record of peacekeeping BUT under UN — we opposed the Coalition of the Willing in Iraq.”
“This is negating [the] idea of [a] Palestinian state,” she added in a later repost. “Nor is it simple peacekeeping. It is peace enforcement under a questionable Trump-Netanyahu Plan!”
 






Mazari expressed agreement with Senator Nasir’s statement, adding that the “scheme” was intended to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state, which was a “core commitment” of the Quaid-i-Azam.
She compared the new peace force to another “Coalition of the Willing”, saying that they “have never provided security or justice”.
 






‘Wonderful decision’ but needs ‘national consensus’
Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry cited the Dawn article, calling the reported plan a “wonderful decision” but urging a national consensus before such decisions were made.
“I call upon those in power: take [the] nation in confidence, bring political temper down in [the] house; such decisions need national consensus,” he said.
 






The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility.</p><small>2025-10-28 10:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28133708e0e4845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951761/wb-projects-economic-growth-in-pakistan-to-remain-at-3pc-in-fy26-due-to-flood-impact' target='_blank'><strong>WB projects economic growth in Pakistan to remain at 3pc in FY26 due to flood impact</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s economy has expanded by three per cent in fiscal year 2025 (FY25), the World Bank said in a report on Tuesday, but cautioned that growth is likely to remain the same in the next fiscal year due to the impacts of the recent floods.
Earlier this month, the WB had cut its growth forecast for Pakistan by half a per cent to 2.6pc for the current fiscal year due to the recent floods, which are also expected to push up inflation to 7.2pc. It had said that for FY 2025/26, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was projected to remain around 2.6pc, as ongoing catastrophic floods had damped the forecast.
It projected a 3.1pc growth rate for the country in its previous biannual outlook in April 2025. Pakistan has set 4.2pc growth target and has since been looking at 3.5pc as part of its engagements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In the report released today, titled —  Staying the Course for Growth and Jobs — WB predicted that the economy’s “growth is projected to remain at three per cent for the fiscal year ending in June 2026, due to the impacts of recent floods on the agriculture sector, before picking up in the medium term as ongoing stability and continued reforms enhance growth prospects.”
It said that the country’s economy “expanded by three per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2025, up from 2.6pc in the previous year.”
“Immediate and lingering impacts of the recent floods are expected to weigh on growth, with real GDP growth projected to remain at three per cent in FY26,” it added.
Citing the reasons behind the expansion, the WB stated that, “Fiscal tightening and appropriate monetary policy helped anchor inflation and support current account and primary fiscal surpluses amidst a challenging global and domestic environment.”
“Improved confidence supported industry and service sector growth, even as agriculture growth underperformed, in part due to adverse weather and pest infestations,” it added.
However, it cautioned that while the outlook remained favourable, it also “has been tempered by recent floods, which have resulted in significant impact on people and damage to urban areas and agricultural land.”
“Pakistan’s recent floods have imposed significant human costs and economic losses, dampening growth prospects, and adding pressure on macroeconomic stability,” the World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, Bolormaa Amgaabazar, was quoted as saying in the release.
Amgaabazar continued: “Staying the course on reforms and accelerating job creation is critical to maintaining growth along with strengthening social safety nets and infrastructure that protects the most vulnerable citizens, and that will help ensure sustainable development and economic resilience for all.”
For FY27, the WB projected 3.4pc growth, “predicated on continued macroeconomic stability and commitment to key economic reforms.”
However, the lending body cautioned that the growth “will likely remain constrained amid tight fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding buffers amid continuing global policy uncertainty and vulnerability to natural disasters and climate shocks.”
According to the lead author of the WB report, Mukhtar Ul Hasan, “sustaining progress will require a balanced mix of revenue and expenditure measures to manage flood impacts while maintaining progress towards fiscal consolidation.”
He termed the “urgent implementation“ of priority fiscal reforms as “essential.”
These reforms can include: broadening the tax base, strengthening tax administration, and reducing the presence of the state in the economy through state-owned enterprise divestiture and rationalising the public sector.
On the matter of exports, the statement, citing a chapter from the report, said, “Pakistan’s exports have declined from 16pc of GDP in the 1990s to around 10pc in 2024, leaving growth dependent on debt and remittance-driven consumption, which underlies Pakistan’s recurrent boom-bust cycles.”
“The chapter cites high tariffs, cumbersome regulations, and costly energy and logistics as key constraints, noting that recent tariff reforms mark a historic step toward openness,” the statement read.
It continued: “The chapter calls for broader measures, including a market-determined exchange rate, stronger trade finance, improved logistics and compliance, deeper trade agreements, and expanded digital and energy infrastructure to drive export-led growth, including in emerging IT services exports.”
The co-author of the report, Anna Twum, said, “The government has placed export growth at the centre of its development agenda and has made important strides in tackling policy and structural barriers, most recently through the approval of the National Tariff Policy, which will help lower costs for critical imported inputs.“
“However, tariff reforms alone will not suffice and must be complemented by broader measures to ensure a market-determined exchange rate, strengthen trade finance, enhance trade facilitation, and expand access to export markets,“ Twum added.
On October 1, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also maintained Pakistan’s growth forecast for the current year at three per cent, while revising its inflation forecast upwards to six per cent, citing the impact of recent floods on agriculture and infrastructure.
On Monday, the government claimed a rare Rs1.5 trillion federal fiscal surplus — instead of usual deficits — in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.
Flood losses
In September, massive floods in the country struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
Record monsoon rains since late June, amplified by dam releases from India, submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh in the past month.
Officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in 2022 floods, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
 
 

Out on the plains, satellite images have traced the scale. A report from the agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16.
In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
“About 50pc of rice, and 60pc of cotton and maize crops have been damaged,” said Khalid Bath, chairman of the Pakistan Farmers Association.</p><small>2025-10-28 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28124317d2d0756.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951757/last-ditch-effort-underway-to-salvage-talks-with-kabul-despite-talibans-stubbornness-security-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Last-ditch effort underway to salvage talks with Kabul despite Taliban’s ‘stubbornness’: security sources</strong></a><br><p>A last-ditch effort is underway to salvage ongoing talks between Islamabad and Kabul, despite the Afghan Taliban’s “stubbornness”, security sources said on Tuesday.
A second round of talks between the two sides had begun on Saturday in Istanbul. This followed the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19, which had resulted in a permanent ceasefire after days of intense border clashes.
The Qatar talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. The agreement reached in Doha extended an initial 48-hour truce and resulted in a permanent ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
“On the third day, the talks continued for 18 hours. During the 18 hours, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and terrorism,” a well-placed security source said.
They added that while the Afghan delegation acknowledged the central issue,  its position changed due to “instructions received from Kabul”.
The security sources termed the “illogical and illegal advice received from Kabul” responsible for the “failure of the talks”. They affirmed that Pakistan and the hosts wanted to resolve the “complex issues in a very thoughtful and serious manner”.
“A last-ditch effort is still underway, despite the Taliban’s stubbornness, to somehow resolve this issue through logic and talks and the talks are moving towards a final round,” the security official said.
 
 

Earlier, sources familiar with the closed-door discussions said that while “most of the points had been mutually agreed between the two sides”, the mechanism for verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, particularly the outlawed TTP, continued to be the main sticking point.
The atmosphere earlier yesterday had been markedly positive, with participants des­c­­ribing “encouraging progress” and “serious engagement” from both delegations.
However, by nightfall, it appeared that the process had once again hit a roadblock. According to the participants, the Afghan Taliban delegation continued to resist putting anything in writing, especially on the issue of providing verifiable guarantees to end support for the TTP.
“We kept hoping that we would be able to sign a mutual document with Afgha­nistan soon, followed by a joint statement, but it still remains out of our reach,” one source said yesterday.
“The hosts understand Pakistan’s concerns,” one Pakistani official said, “but people in Kabul and Kandahar are not willing to commit“.
“It is a difficult phase,” another source admitted, reflecting the growing sense of frustration within the room as stalemate persisted.
“The Afghan side has made it clear that tensions benefit no one,” one member of the delegation said. “We are hopeful that these talks will produce a positive outcome.”
Mediators from Turkiye and Qatar were said to share this sentiment. “Even if the talks didn’t produce a breakthrough, the fact that both sides stayed engaged for three straight days is important,” one mediator said. “It shows that neither wants the process to collapse.”
The tone on Monday contrasted with the pessimism that followed Sunday’s nine-hour discussions, when Pakistani officials said Islamabad had presented its final position to the Taliban delegation. “Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” a senior security official had said.</p><small>2025-10-28 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630899-karachis-new-e-challan-system-nets-over-rs125m-in-six-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi's new e-challan system nets over Rs12.5m in six hours</strong></a><br><p>

Quid Pro Quo Plus is a military doctrine that entails a retaliatory response to Indian aggression exceeding the initial provocation in scale or severity.
“Pakistan would continue to uphold its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus,’ thereby reinforcing strategic stability in South Asia,” Gen Jamil said while addressing the concluding session of a three-day workshop hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) in Islamabad.
“Pakistan,” he added, “stands fully prepared to respond to any act of aggression, strategic, operational, or tactical, with resolve and capability, ensuring the preservation of deterrence equilibrium in the region.”
The statement follows an ongoing tense period this month, which revived brinkmanship last seen during India’s “Operation Sindoor” airstrikes in May.
It also comes as Indian armed forces prepare for Exercise Trishul, a major drill from Oct. 30 to Nov 10 near the disputed Sir Creek region, with Indian officials warning of “overwhelming retaliation” against any cross-border terrorism. Jamil cautioned that global power politics were upsetting the regional balance of power. “Great power politics has facilitated a discriminatory transfer of advanced and emerging technologies to India, thereby undermining the strategic balance in South Asia,” he said.
“Such preferential access is reshaping the regional security paradigm and transforming the nature and character of warfare across the region.”
He said this international support has emboldened India’s actions.
“Emboldened by these external enablers and strategic partnerships, India has increasingly exhibited adventurist tendencies, particularly evident in the post-Pahalgam incident,” he noted.
Referring to a May confrontation between the two countries following the Pahalgam incident, Jamil said the episode “effectively challenged India’s misplaced notions of escalation dominance and escalation control”.
Pakistan, he said, “once again demonstrated restraint and responsibility, reaffirming the credibility and maturity of its nuclear deterrence posture”.
Jamil warned that India’s “Hindutva-driven nationalism” poses a “grave challenge to regional peace and strategic stability,” which he said reflects “the ideological and strategic imprint of Chanakya’s Mandala Theory” of power politics and regional dominance.
“India’s increasingly offensive military doctrines, coupled with a culture of coercive behaviour, underscore both its intent and capability to project aggression in the region,” he cautioned.

The leaders signed the documents, which included critical minerals, at the neo-Baroque-style Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, beneath three chandeliers decorated from top to bottom with gold ornamentation, as aides applauded.

No direct mention was made publicly by the leaders about China, which processes over 90 per cent of the world’s rare earths, making it the source of each country’s concern about its mineral supply chain. Beijing has recently expanded export curbs.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South Korea to discuss a deal that would pause steeper US tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls.
Japan and the US would use economic policy tools and coordinated investment to speed up the “development of diversified, liquid, and fair markets for critical minerals and rare earths”, and aim to provide financial support to selected projects within the next six months, the White House said.
Both countries would consider a mutually complementary stockpiling arrangement and cooperate with other international partners to ensure supply chain security, it added in a statement.
While dominated by China, the US and Myanmar control 12pc and 8pc of global rare earth extraction, according to Eurasia Group, and Malaysia and Vietnam cover another 4pc and 1pc of processing, respectively.
US energy supplies
Japan has pledged a $550 billion investment into the US economy, part of the wider bilateral trade deal, which could include power generation and liquefied natural gas, among other areas, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Ahead of Trump’s Asia trip, the US called on Russian energy buyers, including Japan, to cease imports, and imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two biggest oil exporters — Rosneft and Lukoil — to push the Kremlin to the negotiation table to end the war in Ukraine.
Japan has stepped up US LNG purchases in the last few years as it tries to diversify away from its key supplier Australia and prepare for supply contract expirations from Russia’s Sakhalin-2 LNG project, which Mitsui and Mitsubishi helped to launch in 2009.
In June, Jera, Japan’s top LNG buyer, agreed to buy up to 5.5 million metric tons per annum of US LNG under 20-year contracts, with deliveries starting around 2030. This is roughly the same amount Japan imports annually from Sakhalin-2.
Most supply from Sakhalin-2, which covers 9pc of Japan’s gas needs, ends in 2028-2033. Japan buys less than 1pc of its oil imports from Russia under a sanctions waiver, with the bulk of its oil supply covered by the Middle East.
Last week alone, Japan’s biggest city gas supplier, Tokyo Gas, signed a preliminary deal to buy 1 million metric tons per annum of LNG from the Alaska LNG project, following a similar announcement from Jera in September.
Jera pledged $1.5 billion for gas assets in Louisiana in its first foray into upstream production in the US, where Tokyo Gas and Mitsui are already present.
To keep electricity prices in check, Japan wants to continue Sakhalin-2 LNG imports, a senior official has said, as it takes only a few days to deliver LNG to Japan compared to around a week from Alaska and roughly a month from the US Gulf Coast.
“The US said it wants Japan to stop importing Russian energy — but this is Japan’s closest LNG source and which is also cheap,” said Nobuo Tanaka, chief executive with Tanaka Global, Inc. advisory.
“I think the question should be framed this way: can the US provide Japan with LNG as cheap as what currently comes from Russia? Can gas from Alaska be that affordable?”</p><small>2025-10-28 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28103810d556886.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951750/sources-say-indian-refiners-have-paused-new-russian-oil-orders-await-clarity' target='_blank'><strong>Sources say Indian refiners have paused new Russian oil orders, await clarity</strong></a><br><p>Indian refiners have not placed new orders for Russian oil purchases since sanctions were imposed, as they await clarity from the government and suppliers, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
Some refiners are tapping the spot markets to meet their crude oil needs, said the sources, who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
State-run Indian Oil (IOCNS), has issued a tender for the purchase of oil, while conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELINS), has boosted purchases from spot markets, according to sources.
The European Union, the UK and the US have imposed a raft of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine, including fresh US sanctions on Thursday that target Russia’s two top oil producers, Lukoil (LKOHMM), and Rosneft (ROSNMM).
Indian refiners are poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil to comply with the new US sanctions, Reuters reported on Thursday, potentially removing a major hurdle to a trade deal with the US.
Last week, Reliance, the top Indian buyer of Russian oil, said it will abide by the sanctions while maintaining its relationship with current oil suppliers. Reuters also reported that the firm plans to stop importing oil from Rosneft.
“We have not placed orders yet for fresh cargoes and have cancelled some that were booked from traders with links to the sanctioned entities,” said one of the sources.
“We need to ensure that our purchases are not linked to sanctioned entities as banks will not facilitate payments,” a third source said.
A separate source said his firm is waiting to see if it can get cargoes from non-sanctioned traders or entities.
India bought 1.9 million barrels per day in the first nine months of 2025, or 40 per cent of Russia’s total exports, according to the International Energy Agency.
India’s Russian oil imports between April and September fell 8.4pc on year due to narrower discounts and tighter supplies, with refiners seeking more oil from the Middle East and the US, according to trade sources and shipping data.</p><small>2025-10-28 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630877-lahore-becomes-worlds-most-polluted-city-with-hazardous-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore becomes world's most polluted city with 'hazardous' air quality</strong></a><br><p>

They reportedly used the lawmaker’s Vigo, besides their own car, in their escape. The Vigo was, however, found abandoned away from the residence.
Initial information collected by police suggested that the outlaws drove into Dheran village, near Moro town of Naushahro Feroze district by a car, climbed the outer wall of Behan’s residence to jump into it and held all those present inside hostage.
They comfortably collected cash, jewellery and other valuables worth millions of rupees and boarded their car and the MNA’s 4x4 vehicle to escape to their hideout.
Police found the 4x4 vehicle abandoned near the Dars police station, a few kilometres away from the village.
The MNA was not present at his residence when the robbery took place, and there was no mention of any official or private security guards in the initial inquiry report.
Soon after the robbers’ escape, all officers and personnel of the police station concerned, along with a forensic team, IT and geo-fencing staff, footprint tracker unit, as well as some private footprint trackers, rushed to the MNA’s residence and started doing their respective jobs. They were personally supervised by Naushahro Feroze SSP Mir Rohal Khan Khoso.
In his immediate reaction, MNA Behan told journalists that it might have been a conspiracy involving some influential figures of the area.
The SSP expressed his confidence that the police investigators would reach the culprits very soon with the help of footprint trackers.
A formal FIR of the incident was yet to be registered.
National Peoples Party (NPP) Chairman and a senior Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaderGhulam Murtaza Jatoi — one of the main political rivals of MNA Behan — visited the shocked lawmaker to express his sympathies over the incident.

• Retired Gen Ehsanul Haq says Zaeef insisted on remaining in Islamabad, despite warnings from Pakistani officials
ISLAMABAD: Over 20 years after his now-infamous handover to American forces following their invasion of Afghan­istan, a former Pakistani spymaster has claimed that it was his own countrymen, and not Pakistan, that handed over former Taliban ambassador Abdus Salam Zaeef to the US.
The claim, which comes in the midst of an escalating fracas with a resurgent Taliban in Kabul, was made by retired Gen Ehsanul Haq, who took over the reins of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
For years, it was believed that Zaeef — who was the Afghan Taliban regime’s envoy to Islam­abad at the time of the 9/11 atta­cks — was handed over to the Americans in violation of international law.
In his book, My Life With The Taliban, the former envoy had asserted that he was given into US custody in Peshawar, and this account has never been publicly challenged by any Pakistani official.
However, when asked about Zaeef’s claims during a recent seminar, the former four-star general recounted how the previous Taliban regime came to be ‘de-recognised’, and how Pakistani officials tried for months to convince the envoy to leave Islamabad to avoid the situation he later faced.
Zaeef spent just under four years as a captive in the infamous US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, and was eventually released in 2005.
 
 

When approached for comment, Zaeef said he rejected the former general’s statement.
In his remarks at a recent seminar on Pakistan and Afgha­n­istan relations — organised by the Khyber Margalla Founda­tion, an Islamabad-based organisation of government servants, retired officials and professionals from Khyber Pakht­unkhwa — Gen Haq recalled that Zaeef was told that he should leave Islamabad. If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said.
“When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.”
“Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said.
 
 

Although Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11.
The former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out.
He also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said.
“A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said.
Gen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad.
“Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.

• Province cites slow, inadequate response from federal cybercrime agency
LAHORE: Unhappy with the performance of the National Cybercrime Inve­stigation Agency (NCCIA), the Punjab government has decided in pri­nciple to set up its own wing to deal with the rising incidents of cybercrime in the province.
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mar­yam Naw­az here on Monday. “The Cybercrime Wing will be establis­hed in Pun­j­ab to curb the misuse of digital platforms,” the meeting decided.
A senior official told Dawn that Punjab had been facing difficulties as its complaints were not properly addressed by the NCCIA and often took too long to be disposed of.
“Keeping in view the sharp rise in cybercrime in the most-populated province of the country, Punjab feels the need to have a separate wing to deal with the menace,” he said.
After the NCCIA was established in May this year — replacing the Fede­ral Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime Wing — the Pun­jab government tried to develop a “working relationship” with the federal authority, but it did not yield results.
The Punjab government has been facing increasing challenges on social media, particularly the targeting of the Sharif family by pol­itical opponents. Even provincial ministers, including Information Minister Azma Bokhari, have filed compl­aints with the NCCIA agai­nst individuals invol­ved in online character assassination.
Ms Bokhari recently ann­o­unced plans to move the NCCIA against TV anchor Mubasher Lucman under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for alleged defamation.
Questions, however, are being raised about whether the proposed provincial cyb­­e­rcrime wing is inten­d­ed to target political rivals.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.
 
 

“In the NCCIA, compla­ints arrive in thousands eve­ry month. Most are related to account hacking, harassment, and financial fraud,” an official told Dawn.
“In harassment cases, many inv­olve the uploading of objectionable photos or videos — often by ex-husbands, ex-fiancés, or boyfriends — to blackmail victims. But the NCCIA lacks the staff and resources needed to handle such a massive volume.”
He said evidence collection also remains a major challenge due to non-cooperation from some social media platforms, including Faceb­ook, WhatsApp, Google, and Gmail.
“There is no treaty betw­een the government and these companies, so they are not legally bound to share data with the NCCIA. Only in cases involving life threats or ransom do they respond promptly. Besides, the authority is not equipped with the latest software required to trace and verify digital evidence,” he added.
Over the past few years, the number of cybercrime complaints has increased manifold, but the government has not taken steps to strengthen the capacity of the investigating agency, including training officers in countries that have advanced cybercrime systems.
“The government should build the cybercrime setup on the pattern of the FBI,” the official suggested.

• Maintain Islamabad would prefer deployment to be under UN mandate; cite country’s strong track record in peacekeeping missions
• Indonesia, UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan among nations being asked to send troops; Tel Aviv opposes deployment of Turkish forces
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is expected to soon announce whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) being assembled for Gaza, officials said, amid indications that the government is leaning toward participation.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”.
According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
 
 

The force’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
While the Trump administration has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan to contribute to the multinational force.
However, on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar openly opposed Turkiye’s inclusion in the ISF, over Turk­ish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s “hostile approach against Israel”.
On Sunday, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had said his country would decide which foreign forces to allow in Gaza, and hinted that he would be strongly opposed to any role for Turkish security forces.
According to a report in the Israeli press, members of the Israeli parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee were told during a closed-door briefing last week that the ISF — comprising soldiers from Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Pakistan — would “be tasked with maintaining internal security and policing in Gaza, as well as assisting Israel in securing the borders and preventing weapons smuggling into the territory”.
These reports come as Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir visits Egypt and Jordan, two countries deeply involved in post-ceasefire developments related to Gaza.
While the military has described his visits as focused on promoting defence ties, sources said the fragile implementation of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan featured prominently in his discussions with regional leaders.
During his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, Field Marshal Munir praised Egypt’s pivotal role in calming tensions and achieving stability in the Middle East, according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency. He also lauded Egypt’s “tireless efforts” to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Egypt, a primary mediator alongside Qatar and the United States, hosted the pivotal Sharm el-Sheikh summit on Oct 13, where the plan’s first phase was signed.
According to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), President Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s “positive and proactive contributions” to matters of importance for the world and the Muslim ummah.
Analysts believe the army chief’s discussions in Cairo point to Pakistan’s potential involvement in the stabilisation force and the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre being set up to oversee the peace plan’s implementation.
In Jordan, during Field Marshal Munir’s meetings with King Abdullah II and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maj Gen Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti, the Jordanian leadership acknowledged Pakistan’s “contributions toward peace and regional security,” according to ISPR.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the stabilisation force was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility.
“We were among the ori­ginal backers of the peace architecture for Gaza. To step aside now would mean abandoning an initiative we helped shape,” said one senior official. “There’s a moral obligation, not just a political one.”
Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counterterrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment.
“Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.

“Flood-related supply disruptions and temporary border closures have put upward pressure on prices of a few essential commodities”, said the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in its Monthly Economic Update & Outlook – October 2025. However, it claimed inflation would remain in the target range of 5-6pc this month, which had already reached 5.6pc in September, against the MoF’s forecast of 3.5-4.5pc made on Sept 30.
The MoF said net federal revenues surged by 231.4pc to Rs3.27 trillion in the first two months (July-August) of FY26, compared to Rs986.7 billion in the same period last year. This was driven by a 721.1pc jump in non-tax revenues and a 14.1pc rise in FBR tax collections.
“The surge in non-tax revenues was mainly led by higher State Bank of Pakistan profits, supplemented by increased receipts from dividends, defence receipts, Windfall Levy against crude oil, the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess, and the petroleum levy. During July-Sep FY26, FBR’s tax collection rose to Rs2.884tr, up 12.5pc.

Finance ministry warns of inflation from supply disruptions, trade hurdles

On the expenditure side, total outlays increased modestly by 7.6pc to Rs1.76tr. “Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a surplus of Rs1.509tr, compared to a deficit of Rs648.8bn last year. The primary balance also improved sharply, posting a surplus of Rs2.939tr, up from Rs49.4bn in the corresponding period”, it said.
It said the climate shocks weighed on agriculture, but the sector showed early signs of resilience. According to a preliminary assessment, the recent flood has caused Rs430bn losses to the agriculture sector, damaging crops like rice, cotton, sugarcane, maise, fodder and vegetables. “Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that recovery efforts are underway, supported by increased agricultural credit, higher machinery imports, and improved fertiliser off-take”, it said.
On the other hand, the MoF hoped for improved export prospects, driven by stronger economic momentum in Pakistan’s export destinations. “The Composite Leading Indicator position of the US, UK, China and the euro area has further strengthened compared to the last month, with all moving above or near their long-term potential levels, signalling improved export prospects for Pakistan”, it said.
The monthly report said Pakistan’s economy maintained its recovery path despite flood-related disruptions. “Industrial activity remains resilient, supported by a rebound in Large-Scale Manufacturing, particularly in cement, automobiles, and allied sectors, while exports and remittances are showing steady improvement”, it said, adding the external sector remained stable, with a current account surplus recorded in September, amid robust remittance inflows.
It highlighted the successful IMF review under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, noting that it reaffirmed confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and prudent macroeconomic management. “Continued progress in privatisation, digital governance, and CPEC Phase 2.0 joint ventures underscores the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, structural transformation, and sustainable, inclusive growth”, the report added.
The MoF said the government would remain firmly committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and providing targeted social protection within a sound and forward-looking macroeconomic policy framework.
