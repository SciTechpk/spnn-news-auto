In a statement, the representative body of healthcare professionals said the “unannounced and aggressive entry of FBR teams into private healthcare facilities — particularly across Punjab — has reached an intolerable level of harassment”.
Such measures threaten the very fabric of healthcare delivery in the country, said PMA Secretary General Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro in a statement. “The PMA highlights that recent raids, which forced the immediate suspension of Outpatient Department (OPD) services, are not merely administrative issues; they constitute a direct interference in patient management and a violation of the sanctity of life-saving institutions,” according to the statement.
It said the presence of enforcement officials in clinics “creates an atmosphere of fear, causes psychological distress to patients, and disrupts surgical teams”.

Association claims such measures threaten fabric of healthcare delivery

“Tax collection must never come at the cost of human life. Doctors are not ‘traders,’ and hospitals are not ‘retail outlets’. The private sector serves over 70pc of Pakistan’s population. Treating healthcare providers as commercial vendors is a gross misinterpretation of a noble profession,” he stated.
“While we respect the rule of law, audits should be conducted through documented, professional channels not through ‘commando-style’ raids that victimise healers. This targeted victimisation discourages professional excellence and pushes our brightest medical minds to seek opportunities abroad,” it claimed.
The PMA said the doctors were ready to comply with taxation, provided there was accountability for how that money would be spent. “We demand that the tax collected from the sweat and toil of healers not be squandered on the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling elite,” he stated.
It called upon the PM and the finance minister to take immediate notice. “We demand an immediate cessation of these aggressive tactics,” Dr Shoro stated.
He warned that if the FBR does not immediately halt the ‘harassment’, the PMA will be forced to take the final, definitive step of a nationwide suspension of services. “The responsibility for any resulting healthcare crisis will rest solely on the shoulders of the FBR and the relevant authorities,” he added.
In December 2025, the FBR deployed Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, marking a shift toward on-site monitoring. The initiative gained momentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns.

LAHORE: The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) has appealed to the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to oppose “fascism, restore the Constitution, and safeguard the country’s sovereignty”.
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai said while speaking to journalists at the Lahore Press Club on Saturday.
Mr Achakzai invited people from all walks of life to join the movement for the restoration of the Constitution and to take to the streets on Feb 8, marking the second anniversary of the February 2023 elections. “If we do not come out on the roads to stop fascism, restore the Constitution and the country’s sovereignty on Feb 8, we will all be responsible for Pakistan’s downfall,” he warned.
Flanked by TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Haqooq-i-Khalq Party chief Ammar Ali Jan and Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Mr Achakzai said powerful quarters had blocked the natural process of leadership development through suppression, leading to internal crises. Unlike other countries, he said, courts had even snatched a political party’s election symbol.
Referring to PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, the TTAP chief said the former PM had tried to follow the constitutional path but was sidelined and punished with a 10-year forced exile.
Expressing hope that history would forgive him, Mr Achakzai said he had conveyed to Mr Sharif and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the next democratic government should honour judges who did not surrender to pressure and instead resigned from their positions, by conferring upon them the title of “Heroes of Democracy”. He said such judges should eventually be restored all the privileges they had given up in their struggle to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts.
Responding to a question, Mr Achakzai said Pakistan could approach the United Nations to convene a round-table conference involving Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China to discuss issues and find solutions. “No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the “powerful” were blocking all avenues for reform and denying people their right to protest. “If the powerful block all ways to bring reforms, the people will rise to dismantle the oppressive system,” he warned. He said the martial laws imposed by Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf and the current “undeclared martial law” were responsible for abrogating the Constitution.
Calling on people to join the movement, he said the TTAP had been launched to restore the Constitution and empower citizens to claim their due rights.
Ammar Ali Jan formally announced his party’s decision to join the TTAP movement for the restoration of the Constitution and democracy. He lamented that parliament had been rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary weakened and the media shackled. He said the country’s GDP was stagnant, more than 40 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line, educated and skilled youth were leaving the country, while a few companies were earning billions of dollars in profits.
He said the people of Pakistan had the right to decide who should represent and rule them, rather than having state institutions decide the fate of the country and its citizens. “Those who work within their defined responsibilities will earn respect and honour from the people,” he said, adding that those who crossed their limits would face resistance and chaos.
Former senator Khokhar said people’s lives had been ruined by the suppression of opposition. “When you push the opposition against the wall, people themselves rise and assume the role of opposition,” he said, citing the example of Azad Kashmir, where an elected government was deposed.
Later, a TTAP delegation, led by Mr Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas, visited Minar-i-Pakistan and spoke to journalists. Local authorities allowed the delegation to enter the historic site but barred its workers and supporters who chanted slogans against the Punjab government.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai called on the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to stand against oppression and fascism and restore true democracy, as envisaged in the Lahore Resolution. He said anyone who suspends or alters the Constitution is liable to punishment under Article 6.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the delegation had come to Minar-i-Pakistan to send a message that the country belongs to its people, and that everyone must come forward to save it from the clutches of oppressors. He asserted that the fascists would ultimately be defeated by the people of Pakistan.
Mustafa Nawaz Khokar said the Punjab government had effectively turned Iqbal Park into a “no-go area” for the public on weekends, noting that the Pakistan Day Resolution was passed at the park.
The TTAP leaders also chanted slogans like “Hum zulm mitanay niklay hein, aao hmaray saath chalo”.
The TTAP delegation also met people on city streets in the night and urged them to join the movement, close shops and observe a wheel-jam on Feb 8. They also distributed pamphlets prepared by the PTI Punjab across city streets, roads and at people’s residences.
The delegation also visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and Bibi Pakdaman to pay homage.

FOREIGN Minister Ishaq Dar is being greeted by Hissein Brahim Taha, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s secretary general, and Ambassador Fawad Sher on his arrival at the bloc’s secretariat in Jeddah.—X/@ForeignOfficePk

ISLAMABAD: The Cou­­ncil of Foreign Min­isters of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday —adopting two resolutions, the first to condemn Israel’s recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state and the second on Tel Aviv’s continued aggression aga­inst the Palestinian people as well as its plans for annexation and displacement from their land.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also participated in the session, where he was received by OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha and Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the bloc, Ambassador Fawad Sheron, upon his arrival.
Israel has recently recognised Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords. Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”.
According to a statement issued by the bloc, OIC Secretary General Taha in his speech emphasised that the extraordinary ministerial meeting was being held at a “very delicate and sensitive time” to discuss the “serious developments affecting the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia”.
Referring to Israel, he described its announcement recognising “Somaliland” region as an independent state as a “dangerous precedent that constituted a flagrant violation of international law and a direct threat to regional security and stability”.
The secretary general explained that the current meeting was a follow-up to an extraordinary session of the executive committee with open membership at the level of permanent representatives, held at the headquarters of the organisation’s general secretariat on Jan 1.
“It clearly reflects the extent of shared concern about these dangerous developments.
It also reflects the collective awareness of member states of the need to adopt a unified, clear, and firm Islamic position that supports the Federal Republic of Somalia, its territorial integrity and sovereignty, based on the principles of the OIC Charter, the provisions of international law, and relevant United Nations resolutions,” he noted.
Palestine situation
In his address, the secretary general also discussed the situation in Palestine, stressing the need to compel Israel, the occupying power, to move to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement.
He called for a comprehensive and permanent cessation of Israeli aggression, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the prevention of the displacement of the Palestinian people and the facilitation of the return of displaced persons to their homes.
The meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers was preceded by a preparatory session at the level of senior officials.
New chancery building
Earlier in the day, Mr Dar inaugurated the new chancery building of the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jeddah at a ceremony, state-run APP reported.
The ceremony was attended by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, Saudi dignitaries, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, prominent members of the Pakistani community, and officials of the Pakistan Consulate in Jeddah.
During the inauguration ceremony, the Pakistani flag was hoisted on the premises of the new chancery building, followed by a tree plantation in the chancery lawn, ribbon-cutting, unveiling of the plaque, and the offering of prayers for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
A brief video report highlighting the features of the project was also displayed.

PESHAWAR: At least 12 terrorists were killed in multiple counterterrorism operations and gun battles in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday, while violence elsewhere in the province left two Counter-Terrorism Dep­artment (CTD) personnel martyred in targeted attacks and claimed the life of a senior JUI-F leader who succumbed to injuries from a bomb blast a day earlier in South Waziristan.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces carried out two intelligence-based operations on Thursday after receiving information about the presence of terrorists.
It said the first operation was conducted in North Waziristan, where troops engaged a terrorists’ location and gunned down six of them in an exchange of fire. The second operation, conducted jointly by police and security forces in Kurram district, resulted in the killing of five terrorists, the statement said.
ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, whom it described as “Indian-sponsored khwarij”. It said the terrorists had been involved in attacks on security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as the targeted killing of civilians.
The military’s media wing said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any remaining terrorists in the areas, adding that counterterrorism operations under the “Azm-i-Istehkam” vision would continue.
Separately, one terrorist was killed, another injured and two were arrested during an exchange of gunfire in the Malagori area of Khyber district, sources told Dawn on Saturday. Residents alerted security forces after spotting a group moving towards the hilly locality of Murad Dhand near the Khunarri dam, the sources added.
The sources said security forces, aided by local armed volunteers, engaged the terrorists, while gunship helicopters and artillery were also called to pound the terrorists’ position.
A video circulating after the clash showed two blindfolded suspects in custody amid a crowd of residents, while an army official urged local volunteers not to shelter terrorists.
Local sources said it was the first such clash in Malagori, where Chinese engineers and workers are stationed for maintenance work at the Warsak Dam and the construction of an irrigation canal from the dam to Peshawar.
CTD officials martyred
Meanwhile, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in the jurisdiction of the Regi police station in Peshawar on Saturday, police said. Police spokesperson Alam Khan said the official, identified as Sanaullah, was targeted in the Regi area and a search operation was launched.
Another CTD official was martyred in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil on Saturday evening after unknown gunmen opened fire on him.
Police and residents said the attack took place in Mena Bazaar, about 25 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters. War Mamund SHO Aslam Khan said the official, identified as Saifur Rehman, 40, died while being shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar.
JUI-F leader dies of wounds
Separately, a senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader and district president of Wafaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, died on Saturday after sustaining injuries in a bomb blast near a madrassa in Wana bazaar a day earlier. Police said an explosive device went off near a religious seminary in the Konra Cheena area of Wana in Lower South Waziristan, leaving Mr Wazir critically wounded. He was shifted towards Dera Ismail Khan for treatment but died on the way, officials said.
Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said investigations were underway.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman con­demned the attack, saying it was not only an assault on an individual but on “a moderate, peaceful and democratic ideology”.
He said the repeated targeting of religious scholars in South Waziristan was alarming and required urgent attention from the state. Party leaders reiterated their commitment to peaceful political struggle, religious harmony, democratic values and constitutional supremacy.
In a separate incident in Upper South Waziristan, peace committee chief Qadeem Khan sustained minor injuries when an improvised explosive device targeted his vehicle in the Barwand area of Serwekai tehsil, police said.
DPO Arshad Khan said the vehicle was damaged in the blast and the injured was shifted to a local hospital, where he was reported to be out of danger. Police cordoned off the area, collected evidence and launched a search for the attackers.

The committee will visit Peshawar and, in coordination with public representatives, review the progress of these schemes.
According to the PM Office Media Wing, the premier met political representatives from KP and assured them about timely completion of ongoing Centre-funded development projects in the province.
He stated that the federal government was fully aware of the problems faced by the people of KP and taking tangible steps, within its jurisdiction, to ensure sustainable solutions to those issues. A detailed discussion was also held on the overall political situation in the province and the challenges faced by the public. Matters related to public welfare, development projects and governance were discussed as well.
‘Lack of governance’
The participants informed the prime minister that the provincial government had completely failed due to a lack of governance.
They said the provincial government had no clear policy regarding health, education, infrastructure or public welfare and was paying little attention to resolving public issues.
The PM urged public representatives to prioritise the resolution of public problems, adding that he had recently distributed laptops, on merit, among male and female students across KP in Haripur.

The KP CM reached Hyderabad earlier today for a day-long trip to mobilise the public for a nationwide street movement.
Speaking at a ‘meet the press’ event, Afridi complained that KP was being meted out “stepmotherly treatment” by institutions that were supposed to strengthen democracy in the country and claimed that the PTI government was “toppled as a result of a London plan”.
Afridi said a 15-point agenda was presented before Pakistan and “everyone agreed” that a military operation was not the solution to any problem. “The actual problem is that decisions are always taken in closed rooms,” he said.
Afridi further added that if a military operation were launched in KP, the provincial government would be obliged to stand with its people. “I have asked my administration to facilitate all those people, whether they leave voluntarily or are forcibly expelled,” he said.

The provincial chief executive further said KP was not being given its rights by the federal government, which had stolen PTI’s mandate. “It is a fake federal government that is ruling after a regime-change plan,” he remarked.
“I am the first CM elected from the merged districts in KP, and these tribal areas have remained deprived of their rights for the last 78 years,” he complained, adding that whenever sacrifices are discussed, tribal people’s contributions are cited as examples.
He said that when his name as provincial chief executive was announced, a spokesperson of an institution rejected it.
The KP CM lamented that other chief ministers travel in Pakistan Air Force jets frequently, both within and outside Pakistan. “We often saw that even breakfasts were brought through these jets,” he added.
Afridi recalled that the federal government had committed funds for the TDPs in the area, but these funds were not provided. He said the KP government had provided Rs7.5 billion out of its own resources.
“I have often mentioned that the merged districts are denied their share in the NFC’s divisible pool. The NFC is meant to be disbursed among four provinces, but it is technically shared among only 3.5 or 3.75 provinces, which is a constitutional violation,” he said.
Afridi further said that erstwhile FATA areas “were not included in the NFC” and noted that these districts were not financially integrated into KP. He also claimed that KP’s share in the NFC exceeds Rs1,300 billion.
“Rs100 billion had been promised but was not provided; it now stands at Rs300 billion, based on a ratio of 3 per cent of the divisible pool,” he said, adding that only Rs132 billion had been given, while the liability stood at Rs 568 billion.

Regarding claims of lawlessness in his province, he said the KP government lacks writ in areas “falling under cantonments”.
Afridi added that the people of his province were satisfied with the KP government despite “oppression and attempts to eliminate the PTI”. “People not only voted for PTI but also protected it,” he added.
He emphasised that “nationalist interests” are supreme, however, if Imran Khan seeks an independent judiciary and free media, this should not be interpreted as “stubbornness” on his part, as only real democracy can strengthen Pakistan.
After arriving in the city, Afridi addressed PTI supporters and workers at Khurshid Chowk and in other areas of the city.
CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests, which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.







Sindh govt grants NOC for PTI’s Mazar-i-Quaid rally
The Sindh government issued a formal no-objection certificate (NOC) to the PTI for their rally on Sunday at Bagh-i-Jinnah, adjacent to the Mazar-i-Quaid, said Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
“The PTI leadership was informed in advance about permission for legal and constitutional activities,” he said.
“There are some procedures for issuing a NOC which would take time to implement, but the Sindh government fulfilled its promise.”
Memon added that the PTI is free to pursue political activities in Sindh, but noted that they would need to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the NOC.
“The Sindh government allows all political parties to carry out activities within the ambit of the law,” he stated.
Arrival in Jamshoro
Earlier today, CM Afridi was welcomed by Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah upon his arrival at the G.M. Syed Edifice.







Addressing the welcome event, CM Afridi said the politics of President Asif Ali Zardari has “ended” the politics of PPP’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto.
“Now, there is Zardari’s control over Sindh,” he said.
Afridi was responding to SUP’s Shah, who had mentioned the KP CM’s remarks from Friday, in which he praised the PPP for “keeping the democratic traditions” of Bhutto and Benazir alive. He said Shah had misconstrued his remarks about PPP’s rule in Sindh.
The chief minister slammed the PPP, which he said was once the “flag-bearer of the Constitution”, for changing the basic fabric of the Constitution through the 26th and 27th Amendments.
“Whenever Imran Khan issues a call for a street movement, we hope that you will support us,” Afridi said.
“The name is Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi. Remember it,” he said, taking a jibe at those who were “scared” of his name. He further quipped that “every chowk is D-chowk” when supporters raised slogans of Islamabad’s renowned D-Chowk.



CM Afridi stressed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s struggle was for the “supremacy of the Constitution and the law, true democracy, rule of law, free media and the restoration of an independent judiciary”.
“God willing, we will not sit calmly unless we fulfil this heartfelt desire of Imran Khan,” he vowed.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Sindh had been deprived of its resources and added that “powerful quarters” have usurped provinces‘ resources.
He said Sindh has the first right to use its gas over any other part of the country, adding that no one could snatch the province’s water.
Raja pointed out that the PTI supported Sindh’s stance on the six canals issue. He maintained that PTI was not there for “politics of power” and therefore, it would not strike a deal.

In his speech, the SUP president came down hard on the PPP, accusing it of selling Sindh’s resources in lieu of power.
Shah said that for the last 79 years, either “military rule or puppet civilian rulers have ruled the country”. He said a “fake government” was installed not only in the 2024 elections but in 2022 as well, when Imran was ousted.
He demanded fresh and transparent elections and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran and Yasmin Rashid.
In a post on Facebook, the SUP demanded the release of “all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, Ali Wazir, Mahrang Baloch, and Moro [incident’s] prisoners“.



At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video, saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. Another video showed him raising slogans of “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi”.
Hours earlier, the PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the SUP was ready to welcome Afridi, with a stage set.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh told reporters that Jamshoro district’s Kotri city was also among the party caravan’s stops.
In a post earlier in the day, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House.







In a post on X, the PTI detailed the KP CM’s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he is set to address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”.
The party agenda also listed an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar.
The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent.
Departure from Karachi
“[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced Sheikh shortly after 12pm.
“God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier.







Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.”
Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”.
“We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed.







“Toward Hyderabad for street movement [sic],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and Raja.







Sheikh also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza.







We are patriots of Pakistan: Salman Akram
Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others, gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy.
Umer Dar, the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present.
Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said.
The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”.
“We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”.
“We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said.







Plan ahead
A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, including the Mazar-i-Quaid gathering and a meeting with the All City Tajir Ittehad Association in Karachi.
The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning.







Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
On the other hand, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.

Major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists on expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout.
The two weeks of protests have posed one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities, although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Following the movement’s largest protests yet on Thursday, new demonstrations took place late Friday, according to images verified by AFP and other videos published on social media.
This was despite an internet shutdown imposed by the authorities, with monitor Netblocks saying early on Saturday that “Iran has now been offline for 48 hours”.







The blackout has sparked fears among activists that authorities are now violently cracking down on the protests, with less chance that the proof will reach the outside world.
According to a report by the Iran Human Rights Activists News Agency, the death toll in the protests rose to 65, Anadolu reported.
The report added that protests took place in 512 locations in 180 cities in all 31 provinces, resulting in the deaths of 50 protesters, 14 law enforcement and security officials, and one government-affiliated civilian.
Demonstrations also left dozens injured and 2,311 detained. The injuries were largely caused by pellet shots and plastic bullets, according to the report.
Authorities have not issued a statement about those killed or injured.
Amnesty International said it was analysing “distressing reports that security forces have intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters” since Thursday in an escalation “that has led to further deaths and injuries”.
Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights group has claimed that at least 51 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, but warned the actual toll could be higher.
Iranian authorities are using the “most blatant tools of repression”, prize-winning filmmakers Mohammad Rasoulof and Jafar Panahi said, pointing to the internet blackout.
“Experience has shown that resorting to such measures is intended to conceal the violence inflicted during the suppression of protests,” they added.
‘Seize city centres’
In Tehran’s Saadatabad district, people banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans as cars honked in support, a video verified by AFP showed.
Other images disseminated on social media and by Persian-language television channels outside Iran showed similarly large protests elsewhere in the capital, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom.
In the western city of Hamedan, a man was shown waving a Shah-era Iranian flag featuring the lion and the sun amid fires and people dancing.
In the Pounak district of northern Iran, people were shown dancing round a fire in the middle of a highway. It was not possible to immediately verify the videos.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted Shah, hailed the “magnificent” turnout on Friday and urged Iranians to stage more targeted protests on Saturday and Sunday.







“Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,” Pahlavi said in a video message on social media.
‘Big trouble’
Pahlavi, whose father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted by the 1979 revolution and died in 1980, added he was also “preparing to return to my homeland” at a time that he believed was “very near”.
Authorities say several members of the security forces have been killed, and Khamenei, in a defiant speech on Friday, lashed out at “vandals” and accused the United States of instigating the protests.
State TV on Saturday broadcast images of funerals for several members of the security forces killed in the protests, including a large gathering in the southern city of Shiraz.
Iran’s army said in a statement that it would “vigorously protect and safeguard national interests” against an “enemy seeking to disrupt order and peace”.
National security council chief Ali Larijani said in comments broadcast late Friday that “we are in the middle of a war”, with “these incidents being directed from outside”.
US President Donald Trump again refused on Friday to rule out new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in June.
“Iran’s in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,” Trump said.
Protester replaces flag at Iranian Embassy in London
A protester briefly replaced the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran at its London embassy with a former flag, flown before 1979, during a demonstration today, witnesses told AFP.
A video posted to social media showed a man on the balcony of the embassy, near Hyde Park, replacing the country’s current flag with one used during the rule of the ousted shah to cheers from hundreds of demonstrators below.
The flag — tri-coloured, with a lion and sun, surrounded by a wreath and crown — was a ceremonial one used in Iran before the 1979 revolution. It stayed in place for several minutes before being removed, witnesses on site told AFP.

“Democracy for Iran. Shah Reza Pahlavi. Justice for Iran,” chanted the demonstrators, referring to the son of the late shah of Iran who now lives in the United States. Some also held placards reading “Free Iran”.
“I’m here to support Iranians, my loved ones inside Iran — they’ve been protesting for two weeks today,” said one demonstrator, Taraneh, 33, who declined to give her last name.
“The internet has been shut down … We get very little information from inside Iran,” she added. “But, you know, people are still in the streets. They’re being attacked.“</p><small>2026-01-10 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10233850f237d57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966208/after-fatal-ice-shooting-minneapolis-mayor-urges-activists-to-avoid-trumps-bait' target='_blank'><strong>After fatal ICE shooting, Minneapolis mayor urges activists to avoid Trump’s ‘bait’</strong></a><br><p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday urged demonstrators protesting the fatal shooting of a motorist by a US immigration agent to stay peaceful, saying that any unlawful actions would play into US President Donald Trump’s hands.
Frey, a Democrat, cautioned them as civil liberties and migrant-rights groups prepared nationwide rallies to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Minnesota and US officials have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting.
Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight in Minneapolis as police responded to protests, including a gathering of demonstrators outside a hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, city Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.
One police officer was injured in the response, O’Hara told a news conference on Saturday.

Frey, who has been critical of immigration agents and the shooting, said the demonstrations to date have remained mostly peaceful and that anyone causing damage to property or engaging in other unlawful activity would be arrested by the police.
“We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos. He wants us to take the bait,” Frey said at the news conference.
The fatal shooting of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the “largest DHS operation ever.”
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a “reckless” example of “governance by reality TV.”
O’Hara said more than 200 law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Hilton Canopy Hotel on Friday night to respond to what started as a “noise protest” but then escalated, with more 1,000 demonstrators gathered on site.
“We initiated a plan and took our time to de-escalate the situation, issued multiple warnings, declaring an unlawful assembly, and ultimately then began to move in and disperse the crowd,” O’Hara said Saturday.
Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a US Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to “weaponize” his vehicle and run over agents.
The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other US cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner “ICE Out For Good” planned for Saturday and Sunday.
Protest organisers said more than 1,000 weekend events have been planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians.
The rallies were being organised by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of “No Kings” protests against Trump last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10225428e5fab22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966207/syrian-authorities-transferring-kurdish-fighters-from-aleppo-to-northeast' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian authorities transferring Kurdish fighters from Aleppo to northeast</strong></a><br><p>Syrian authorities on Saturday began transferring Kurdish fighters from the country’s second city, Aleppo, to areas they control in the country’s northeast, state television reported, after days of deadly clashes.
The violence in Aleppo erupted after efforts to integrate the Kurds’ de facto autonomous administration and military into the country’s new government stalled.
Since the fighting began on Tuesday, at least 21 civilians have been killed, according to figures from both sides, while Aleppo’s governor said 155,000 people have been displaced.
On Saturday evening, state television reported that Kurdish fighters “who announced their surrender … were transported by bus to the city of Tabaqa” in the Kurdish-controlled northeast.
An AFP correspondent saw at least five buses on Saturday carrying fighters leaving the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud district, accompanied by security forces.

Their departure came as US envoy Tom Barrack on Saturday met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and afterwards issued a call for a “return to dialogue” with the Kurds in accordance with an integration agreement sealed last year.
In a statement to the official SANA news agency earlier today, the military announced “a halt to all military operations in the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood”.
A Syrian security source had told AFP that the last Kurdish fighters had entrenched themselves in the area of al-Razi hospital in Sheikh Maqsud, before being evacuated by authorities.
On the outskirts of Sheikh Maqsud, families who were unable to flee the violence were leaving, accompanied by Syrian security forces, according to an AFP correspondent.
Men were carrying their children on their backs as women and children wept, before entering buses taking them to shelters.

Dozens of young men in civilian clothing were separated from the rest, with security forcing them to sit on the ground, heads down, before being taken by bus to an unknown destination, according to the correspondent.
Government forces began striking the district overnight after a deadline elapsed for Kurdish fighters to withdraw during a ceasefire.
Residents waiting to return
At the entrance to the district, 60-year-old resident Imad al-Ahmad waited for permission from the security forces to return home.
“I left four days ago… I took refuge at my sister’s house,” he told AFP. “I don’t know if we’ll be able to return today.”
Nahed Mohammad Qassab, a 40-year-old widow also waiting to return, said she left before the fighting to attend a funeral.
“My three children are still inside, at my neighbour’s house. I want to get them out,” she said.

The clashes, some of the most intense since Syria’s new authorities took power, present yet another challenge as the country struggles to forge a new path after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Both sides have blamed the other for starting the violence in Aleppo.
‘Fierce’ resistance
Kurdish forces earlier reported coming under artillery and drone attacks, and claimed on social media to be mounting a “fierce and ongoing resistance”.
The army said three soldiers had been killed by Kurdish fighters, while state television accused them of launching drones at residential areas of Aleppo. A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until late Saturday.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control swathes of the country’s oil-rich north and northeast, and were key to the 2019 territorial defeat of the Islamic State group.
But Turkey, a close ally of neighbouring Syria’s new leaders, views its main component as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which agreed last year to end its four-decade armed struggle against Ankara.

Turkey has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.
Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria’s northeast, accused Syrian authorities of “choosing the path of war” by attacking Kurdish districts and of “seeking to put an end to the agreements that have been reached”.
“We are committed to them and we are seeking to implement them,” she told AFP.
The March integration agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.
Ahmad welcomed on X a proposal by international mediators to evacuate the Kurdish forces from Sheikh Maqsud, but on condition that the local Kurdish population is protected.
Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the renewed clashes cast doubt on the government’s ability to unite the country after years of civil war.
Syria’s authorities have committed to protecting minorities, but sectarian bloodshed rocked the Alawite and Druze communities last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644383-woman-found-chained-inside-karachis-dha-flat' target='_blank'><strong>Woman found chained inside Karachi's DHA flat</strong></a><br><p>

The decision comes a day after Hayat rebuffed rumors and fake news on social media regarding the extension of holidays and maintained that schools would reopen on Jan 12.
The education minister, however, created a poll on his X account, asking people if schools and colleges should reopen from Jan 12 or 19. The majority of the users voted for Jan 19.







In the latest post today on X, Hayat wrote: “In view of the prolonged severe winter spell and the forecast of extremely low temperatures in the coming days, and on the advice of PDMA, the Government of Punjab has decided to extend winter vacations until January 19.”



Meanwhile, in a separate notification, the Punjab Higher Education Department stated that winter vacations for higher educational institutions were extended from January 10 to January 16 due to the severe weather.
“All colleges (public and private) shall re-open on Monday, January 19, 2026, resuming [the] full/normal week for all classes,” the notification, available with Dawn, read.
It added that BS 4-year programmes would continue to function and all examinations would be held as per the notified schedules of boards and universities.



The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
Earlier in the week, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.
Sindh govt changes school timings until Jan 26
The Sindh government today notified new school timings in the province due to the prevailing cold weather.
A weather advisory from the Met Office forecast cold and dry weather over most districts in Sindh, with a minimum temperature of 9º Celsius and a maximum of 25ºC.“Moderate to dense fog is likely to persist over Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Larkana, Tando Jam, Mohenjodaro and surrounding areas,” the advisory read.
According to a notification from the Sindh government, available with Dawn, all private and public educational institutions would open from 9am on January 12 (Monday) until January 26.



The changes to school timings would apply to educational institutions “under the administrative control of the school education and literacy department”, the notification read.
The decision was made after Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah consulted Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. While schools will open at 9am, school closure times will remain the same.</p><small>2026-01-10 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10210203185ab8b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966205/police-rescue-woman-forcibly-confined-in-karachis-darakhshan' target='_blank'><strong>Police rescue woman forcibly confined in Karachi’s Darakhshan</strong></a><br><p>A woman who was unlawfully confined and chained to a bed in Karachi’s Darakhshan area was rescued by police on Saturday, according to a senior police official.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police received a call about a woman unlawfully confined and bound with chains in a third-floor flat in Darakhshan Commercial Area. The station house officer Darakhshan immediately reached the scene.
The flat was found locked from the inside, with police breaking the lock and entering in the presence of neighbours, the DIG said.
“Inside the bedroom, a woman was found with iron chains tied around her neck, hands and feet. The chains were cut with power tools and the woman was freed,” he added.
The victim, a resident of Shireen Jinnah Colony, alleged that her ex-husband called her to the flat under the pretext of giving her money for their children.
When she arrived at about 9am, her ex-husband and his friend allegedly confined her in the bedroom and chained her to the bed. She further stated that she managed to break the bed to get free, escaped to the balcony and raised a hue and cry to draw attention. Neighbours alerted police on the Madadgar-15 helpline.
DIG added that the victim was taken to Darakhshan police station for further legal action, while police registered a first information report under Sections 337A(1) (punishment of assault to the head or face), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modest) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) PPC.
In December 2024, a young nurse in Karachi was rescued by police from the alleged wrongful confinement by her paternal family, who had shaved her head as a punishment for wanting to marry of her own free will.</p><small>2026-01-10 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10205050995a519.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966197/ttap-leadership-distributes-pamphlets-in-lahore-commences-public-outreach-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP leadership distributes pamphlets in Lahore, commences public outreach campaign</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: After addressing workers and supporters at Minar-i-Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership commenced a public outreach campaign in Lahore.
Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai of the TTAP, visited different markets and commercial areas of the provincial capital to rally support for the opposition alliance’s street movement.
As part of the drive, videos posted on X by the opposition leadership showed the leadership distributing pamphlets.







“A large number of people expressed solidarity with the leadership of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan,” said a post on X by the opposition alliance.
Obstacles at Minar-i-Pakistan
Earlier in the evening, Abbas and Achakzai reached Minar-i-Pakistan to address supporters of the PTI and the opposition alliance.
However, local authorities closed all doors and blocked party workers from entering the Minar-i-Pakistan ground but allowed the TTAP leadership to proceed.







PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik chided the Punjab government for not even allowing the TTAP delegation to present a resolution at Minar-i-Pakistan.
Speaking to Dawn, she said the party had called its workers to accompany the TTAP delegation, but the “terrified Punjab government” shut the gates of the Minar-i-Pakistan ground.
Drawing a comparison, Malik said the Punjab government allegedly smashed the vehicles of delegation members, while Sindh allowed a reception for the PTI delegation led by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.







Later, the TTAP delegation visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and the Bibi Pak Daman shrine to pay homage.
Lahore Press Club address
Abbas and Achakzai also held a press conference at the Lahore Press Club, along with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party General Secretary Ammar Ali Jan.
Abbas, speaking at the press conference, said that the opposition movement was about “reforms, protection of the Constitution, ensuring the rights of the people, and the liberation of the downtrodden classes of society”.







He maintained that those in power were “blocking all routes to any reform”. “What avenues will people be left with otherwise?” the leader questioned.
“They will rise and revolt against the system.”
Achakzai also spoke at the press conference, reiterated his earlier stance that the “Constitution was under attack” and the country had been plunged into a crisis.
“We are the common people of Pakistan, and we love this country just as much as anyone,” he said.
“We have to collectively bring the country out of this crisis,” Achakzai said.
“We are not here to tell people that please come follow us; we are here to ask them to stand with us,” Achakzai added.
Achakzai also called on people to join the opposition’s movement, stating that, “In such a crisis, it is a sin to stay at home; you must come out on the streets”.
“It does not matter what party you belong to, which sect, if you love this country, come and sit with us,” he said.
In response to a question regarding talks with the government, the TTAP chief said that regardless of what happens, “we will not make a deal at the expense of Pakistan”.







Achakzai further reiterated that “Pakistan’s army needs to stay within its framework as other countries’ armies do.”
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” he said.
Achakzai said the powerful quarters “had stopped the natural process of developing leadership through suppression that led to create internal crises.”
Citing that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif tried to take the right path of the constitution, the TTAP chief said he was sidelined and punished for a 10-year forced exile.
Hoping that history would forgive him, Achakzai said that he had asked Nawaz and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the “next democratic government should honour all those judges with the title of ‘heroes of democracy’ — those who did not surrender to the powerful and resigned from their jobs.”
“Such judges should one day be rewarded with all privileges that they had surrendered in their endeavour to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts,” Achakzai said.
Responding to a question, Achakzai suggested Pakistan could request the United Nations to call a round-table conference, where Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China could sit together, thrash out issues and find solutions.
“No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Ammar Ali Jan also spoke at the press conference and announced that his party, along with trade unions and student organisations, was joining the TTAP for “restoration of democracy, upholding of the Constitution, and the security of the country”.







He lamented that the parliament had been “rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary ruined, and the media chained.”
Meanwhile, PTI has also issued a call to the masses to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan, where the TTAP leadership is expected to announce a formal resolution.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged party leaders, workers and others to reach Minar-i-Pakistan and prove themselves as good hosts.
As part of today’s activities, the delegation was expected to head to the Data Darbar and Bibi Pak Daman shrines to pay their tributes.
The TTAP delegation wanted to visit Data Darbar to pay homage as soon as it entered Lahore on Thursday; however, the Punjab government blocked all roads leading to the shrine.
Therefore, the opposition alliance had kept the TTAP delegation’s movements secret, hoping they would find open routes to the shrine and Minar-i-Pakistan.
PTI Punjab also distributed pamphlets in an effort to mobilise the party’s support base for the upcoming street movement.
On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.</p><small>2026-01-10 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644375-sindh-curtails-school-timings-as-cold-wave-grips-province' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh cuts school timings as cold wave grips province</strong></a><br><p>

The 40-year-old woman was shot and injured by her husband in their home on Friday. The initial probe revealed that the incident occurred over a “domestic dispute”.
“The suspect had fled the scene after the incident,” the police official stated.
In the statement issued today, the police confirmed that the suspect is in custody and the murder weapon was recovered from his possession.
The statement added that the suspect was arrested during a raid conducted on Friday night.
“Further interrogation of the suspect is underway, and all the proceedings will be done as per the law,” said SSP Siddiqui.
The suspect is a serving police inspector, posted with the Special Investigation Unit (SIU).
A day earlier, the SSP revealed that it was the suspect’s second marriage to the victim. “The suspect had doubts that his wife was still in ‘contact’ with her former husband,” he said.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.

In particular, the JF-17‘s role in the May conflict and in the skirmish with India in 2019 proved the jet’s capabilities in battle. During last year’s war with India, the Thunder was credited with destroying the state-of-the-art S-400 surface-to-missile system deployed by India at Adampur. The jet also made a strong showing at last year’s Dubai Airshow.
Earlier this week, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.
“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News.
Here is a brief timeline of arms deals that Pakistan has finalised or is currently discussing with friendly countries since May 2025.
January 10, 2026: Iraqi Air Chief expresses ‘keen interest’ in JF-17
On January 10, Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi praised the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) professionalism during the May conflict and expressed interest in acquiring the battle-proven jets during a visit by PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to Iraq.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lt Gen Al-Asadi expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets [and] Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.



January 7: Saudi Arabia in talks for jets-to-loans deal
It was reported earlier this week that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert around $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources told Reuters, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.
One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and that the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.
January 6: Bangladesh expresses interest in buying JF-17s
Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said in a statement.
Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on the PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting the Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.

“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.
“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft.”
December 22, 2025: Pakistan finalises arms deal with Libya
Pakistan signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army last month, entering a select club of countries that export conventional arms and equipment.
A copy of the deal, which was seen by Reuters before it was finalised, listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets and Super Mushak trainer aircraft.

United States President Donald Trump’s threats to seize Greenland have triggered a wave of European solidarity with Denmark. But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality — Denmark is rallying support to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and negotiate directly with Washington.
“Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,” said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen.
Strategic relevance
Denmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its geopolitical relevance in the Arctic territory, strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the US ballistic missile defence system.
Yet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if Greenlanders choose independence — or strike their own deal with Washington.
The stakes extend beyond Denmark’s national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.

Denmark’s foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.
“National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” the two leaders said. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country … Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.”
This week, Frederiksen said: “If the US chooses to attack another Nato country, everything stops, including Nato and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.”

The ‘Greenland Card’
For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.
Copenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump’s threats.
“It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,” he said.
During the Cold War, Greenland’s strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington, allowing it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a Nato ally.

This became known as “the Greenland Card”, according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen’s Centre for Military Studies.
But Greenland’s aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders’ right to independence if they choose.
All Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how and when to achieve it.
Trump’s pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.
“How much should we fight for someone who doesn’t really care about us?” Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.
The financial burden
Copenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland’s economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2025.
The central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800m Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence — bringing total annual spending to just under $1bn.
In addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42bn Danish crowns ($6.54bn) Arctic defence package in response to US criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.
Some reject framing the relationship in transactional terms, pointing to Denmark’s legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.
“We’re talking about family relations, [a] long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,” said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. “So this is much more, it’s not just about defence and economy, it’s about feelings, it’s about culture.”
Difficult balancing act
Prime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.
For now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time “when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the US’s bad side is no good for anyone in the West”.
Frederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.
“I don’t understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,” Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. “To be completely honest, Greenland doesn’t inspire any sense of belonging in me.”</p><small>2026-01-10 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644342-zardari-ended-za-bhutto-benazirs-politics-says-kp-cm-during-sindh-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Zardari 'ended' ZA Bhutto, Benazir's politics, says KP CM during Sindh tour</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, who on a visit to Iraq, called on Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi.
The two met at the Iraqi Air Force headquarters, where ACM Sidhu received a guard of honour upon his arrival, it said.
“Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, with emphasis on joint training, capacity building and improving operational cooperation,” ISPR said.







During the meeting, ACM Sidhu “highlighted the deep-rooted religious, cultural, and historical ties between Pakistan and Iraq”.
He also “reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to support the Iraqi Air Force in training and capacity development”.
The statement said the pair “agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability”.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi air chief commended PAF’s “professionalism and technological advancement”.
The statement added that he also expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.
The commander also appreciated Pakistan for its role in regional stability, it said.
“The visit underscored the shared resolve of both air forces to further strengthen defence ties and professional collaboration,” ISPR added.
The JF-17 Thunder aircraft are jointly developed by Pakistan and China. Earlier this week, Bangla­desh had expressed an int­e­rest in the “potential pro­cu­r­e­ment” of JF-17 Thun­der aircraft.
Meanwhile, reports have emerged stating that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644334-govt-moves-to-address-water-crisis-in-islamabad-via-emergency-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt moves to address water crisis in Islamabad via emergency plan</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said that the two-week-long exercise — which began on Friday and is being held at the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) in Pabbi — will focus on the “counterterrorism domain, involving professional contingents from the armies of Pakistan and the US”.
Officials from both sides attended the opening ceremony, it added.



“The exercise is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and interoperability through the sharing of counterterrorism experiences, while further refining tactics, techniques, and procedures essential for effective CT operations,” the statement said.
“Emphasis is being laid on marksmanship skills during urban warfare, as well as on understanding each other’s operational doctrines and best practices,” it added.
The military’s media wing termed the exercise of “vital importance“, stressing its role in “addressing evolving security challenges, improving professional military standards, and strengthening the capacity of both forces to operate in complex counter-terrorism environments”.
“‘Inspired Gambit 2026’ reflects the continued commitment of Pakistan and the US towards collaborative efforts for peace and stability,” ISPR added.

Dr Sidhu is currently serving as the chairman of the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), a position he assumed in August 2023.
Under his leadership, the CCP witnessed significant institutional turnarounds in its history. Within two years, the CCP reduced its court case backlog by over 70 per cent, with 434 cases decided out of 567 pending matters, helping restore the regulator’s credibility and enforcement capacity.
During Dr Sidhu’s tenure, the CCP recovered approximately Rs1.36 billion in penalties. In contrast, its total recoveries in the last 20 years were merely Rs20o million. The regulator also imposed over Rs2bn in fresh penalties through new enforcement actions.
As CCP head, Dr Sidhu launched a renewed crackdown on cartels and market abuse, initiating major investigations and actions against cartels in poultry, sugar, edible oil, telecom, and medical services. Several of these actions were upheld by the Supreme Court and the Competition Appellate Tribunal, providing strong judicial validation to CCP’s enforcement work.
Dr Sidhu also placed strong emphasis on consumer protection and deceptive marketing enforcement. The CCP imposed significant penalties on companies operating in real estate, FMCG, education, pharmaceuticals, and automobile sectors. These included Kingdom Valley, Unilever, FrieslandCampina Engro, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Hyundai Nishat, British Lyceum and 3N Lifemed, sending a clear signal against misleading business practices.

 

A major institutional reform during his tenure was the launch of the Market Intelligence Unit (MIU), CCP’s first AI-powered surveillance arm. This initiative marked a shift toward data-driven, proactive detection.
On the market facilitation front, the CCP processed 139 mergers across 34 sectors during Dr Sidhu’s tenure. High-profile transactions included the PTCL–Telenor merger, Shell Pakistan’s sale to Wafi Energy, and several deals in financial services, energy, and logistics. The PTCL–Telenor merger order, in particular, was widely noted by stakeholders for balancing investment facilitation with competition safeguards.
The CCP also set up a centre of excellence in competition law. Its purpose was to carry out competition assessment studies to modernise the legal and regulatory framework in every sector of the economy.
According to the CCP website, Dr Sidhu holds a Bachelor’s degree in law, an LLM (Master’s in Law) in banking, insurance and international business law, and a PhD from the University of Manchester. His doctoral research was focused on the investor protection and regulation of stock exchanges in the United Kingdom, the United States and Shariah-compliant stock exchanges.
He also earned a postgraduate diploma in civil litigation from the Manchester Law Society and certifications in mortgage and financial advice from the London Institute of Banking and Finance.
With over 20 years of professional experience, Dr Sidhu has worked with insurance companies, law firms and financial institutions in the UK, as well as government ministries in Pakistan.
Prior to joining CCP, Dr Sidhu had served as a senior legal consultant at the Ministry of Law. He has also worked in the Privatisation Commission in a similar role, and remained a research associate with leading academics in UK universities.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10154514a3c8fda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966196/pakistan-navy-successfully-tests-surface-to-air-missile-at-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy successfully tests surface-to-air-missile at sea</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy conducted a “comprehensive exercise” in the north Arabian Sea, successfully firing a surface-to-air missile, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “Pakistan Navy demonstrated its operational readiness and combat preparedness through a comprehensive exercise in the north Arabian Sea, showcasing both conventional and unmanned capabilities, as per dictates of evolving naval warfare.
“The exercise included the successful live firing of LY-80 (N) surface-to-air missile from a vertical launching system at an extended range, validating the long-range capabilities of Pakistan Navy’s modern air defence systems,” said ISPR.



It said that the missile “successfully engaged and neutralised an aerial target, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s robust air defence capabilities”.
It added that the exercise also featured the “successful engagement” of surface targets using loitering munition, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s precision strike capabilities.
It added that the loitering munition successfully engaged and destroyed surface targets.
“Successful open-sea trials of an unmanned surface vessel were also conducted, marking a significant leap in autonomous naval technology. The trials validated the platform’s ability to combine high-speed performance with mission-critical durability,” it said.
“Key capabilities demonstrated include extreme manoeuvrability, precision navigation and weather resilience,” it said, adding that an unmanned surface vessel offered a low-risk, high-impact solution with the stealth of a tactical interceptor.
It added that the Pakistan Fleet commander witnessed the exercise, which showcased Pakistan Navy’s ability to “employ advanced systems”.
It stated that Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended officers on their “professionalism and operational competence”.
He reaffirmed Pakistan Navy’s resolve to “ensure seaward defence of Pakistan and safeguard national maritime interests under all circumstances”, it added.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10142921ee6a521.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966191/jui-f-leader-succumbs-to-injuries-following-blast-in-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F leader succumbs to injuries following blast in Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area.
Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia.
He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way.
Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible.
The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years.
In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”.
“This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values.
“Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said.
Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”.
He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away.

 

Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection.
The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas.
“The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented.
He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state.
“This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.”
Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents.
He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.







Peace committee chief unhurt in blast
Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil.

Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries.
Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital.
The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.</p><small>2026-01-10 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644312-punjab-extends-winter-vacation-for-schools-colleges-amid-cold-snap' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab extends winter vacation for schools, colleges amid cold snap</strong></a><br><p>

Taking media queries after a meeting with oil and gas executives at White House in Washington, Trump was asked about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s offer to share her Nobel Peace Prize with the US president.
“Norway is very embarrassed with what took place,” Trump said; the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.
“Whether people like Trump or don’t like Trump, I settled eight wars — big ones,” Trump said — a claim that he has repeated in the past.
“Some going on for 36 years, 32 years, 31 years, 28 years, 25 years. Some just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already eight jets were shot out in the air,” Trump said.
He pointed out that he arranged a ceasefire between the two countries in “rapid order without nuclear weapons”.







“I can’t think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel prize more than me, and I don’t want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. Obama got the Nobel prize. He had no idea why. He still has no idea,” Trump said, calling former US president Barack Obama a “bad president”.
“You should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. These were major wars. These were wars that nobody thought could be stopped. President Putin called me [and] he said about two of the wars that he’s been trying to stop them for 10 years [but] he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t believe it,” Trump said.
“So, in theory, you should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. Every war was major. But I don’t care about that; I care about saving lives. I’ve saved tens of millions of lives,” he added, before recalling his Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in September.
“The prime minister of Pakistan came here and he made a very public statement. He said that President Trump saved a minimum [of] 10 million lives having to do with Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging.”
Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations.
The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.

 

India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
Initially stating that five jets were shot down during the May conflict — albeit without specifying of which side — Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October, and then eight in November.
He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “highly respected general”, a “great fighter” and “my favourite”.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101134470a33d42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966182/fo-urges-pakistanis-to-avoid-unnecessary-travel-to-iran-amid-growing-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>FO urges Pakistanis to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Saturday issued a travel advisory urging Pakistani nationals to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest in the neighbouring country.
In a statement, FO said, “For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all unnecessary travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran until conditions improve.”
It also advised Pakistani nationals residing in Iran to exercise “extreme caution, remain vigilant, minimise non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani missions” in Tehran, Zahidan and Mashhad.







The FO also shared the phone numbers for the Pakistan embassy in the three cities; Tehran +98-21-66-9413-88/89/90/91, +98-21-66-9448-88/90, +98 910 764 8298; Zahidan +98 54 33 22 3389, +989046145412; Mashhad +98 910 762 5302, +98 937 180 7175.
Protests have taken place across Iran for nearly two weeks in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
Iranian rights group HRANA said on Friday it had documented at least 62 deaths, including 14 security personnel and 48 protesters, since demonstrations began on December 28.
At the start of January, US President Donald Trump had warned that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters.
In response, in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators “vandals” and “saboteurs”.
In a speech broadcast on state TV, he said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians”, in apparent reference to Israel’s June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own.
He predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.
For his part, Trump issued a new warning to Iran’s leaders on Friday, saying: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.”
“I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that’s a very dangerous place right now,” he added.
Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said Islamabad firmly opposed any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, including Iran, in its first public comments since protests erupted.
He said Pakistan viewed the situation in Iran as an internal matter and rejected external pressure or aggression. The spokesperson stressed that Pakistan did not wish to comment on Iran’s internal developments.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644274-pakistan-us-launch-inspired-gambit-2026-joint-counterterrorism-drill' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US launch 'Inspired Gambit-2026' joint counterterrorism drill</strong></a><br><p>

Bessent said he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since last summer’s summit of G7 leaders, and finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting in December.
India was also invited to attend the meeting, Bessent told Reuters in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries. He said he was unsure if it had accepted the invitation.
It was not immediately clear which other countries had been invited.
The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, as well as the European Union, most of whom are heavily dependent on rare earth supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.
Australia signed an agreement with the US in October aimed at countering China’s dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leveraged Australia’s proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.
Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47 per cent and 87pc of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defence technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Western countries have sought to reduce their dependence on China’s critical minerals in recent years, given moves by China to impose strict export controls on rare earths.
Monday’s meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.
Bessent said China was still living up to its commitments to purchase US soybeans and ship critical minerals to US firms.</p><small>2026-01-10 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1010253295dc3ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966180/venezuela-says-in-talks-with-us-to-restore-diplomatic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela says in talks with US to restore diplomatic ties</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela said on Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, days after US forces deposed Nicolas Maduro as its president.
It was the latest sign of cooperation following the leftist leader’s capture and US President Donald Trump’s claim to be “in charge” of the South American country.
Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy, while in Washington, Trump met with oil companies over his plans to access Venezuela’s huge crude reserves.

 

The government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement.
John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “travelled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity.
Venezuela said it would reciprocate by sending a delegation to Washington.
Rodriguez, in a statement, condemned “the serious, criminal, illegal and illegitimate attack” by the United States and vowed: “Venezuela will continue to confront this aggression through the diplomatic route.”
Trump vows oil investments
Trump said earlier on Friday that he had called off a second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the prisoner releases.
The US president had suggested he might use force again to get his way in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
At a White House meeting on Friday, he pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela’s reserves, but was met with a cautious reception — with ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissing the country as “uninvestable” without sweeping reforms.
Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, “but now you have total security. It’s a whole different Venezuela.”
He also stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela’s oil resources.
Trump earlier said that oil companies promised to invest $100 billion in Venezuela, whose oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions.
He had earlier announced a plan for the United States to sell between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, with the money to be used at his discretion.
He promised any funds sent to Caracas would be used to buy only US-made products.
In the meantime, Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude — oil that would be sold, Trump said.
State-owned oil company PDVSA confirmed in a statement that one vessel was returning to Venezuelan waters, describing it as the “first successful joint operation” with Washington.
Prisoners’ release
Anxious relatives waited outside Venezuelan jails for a glimpse of their loved ones as the authorities began releasing political prisoners — a move Washington claimed credit for.
“When I heard the news, I broke down,” said Dilsia Caro, 50, waiting for the release of her husband, Noel Flores, who was jailed for criticising Maduro.
Venezuela began releasing prisoners on Thursday in the first such gesture since US forces removed and detained Maduro in the deadly January 3 raid.
Trump told Fox News he would meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whom he earlier brushed aside as lacking the “respect” to lead Venezuela.

 

Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that any democratic transition in the country must recognise his claim to victory in the 2024 presidential elections.
Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the vote, but his re-election was widely seen as fraudulent.
Gonzalez was hoping on Friday for the release of his son-in-law, who was detained a year ago in Caracas.
Protests in Caracas
Maduro was seized in a US special forces raid accompanied by airstrikes, operations that left 100 people dead, according to Caracas.
US forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking and other charges.
Rodriguez insisted on Thursday that her country was “not subordinate or subjugated” despite her pledge to cooperate with Trump.
Angry protesters rallied in the streets of Caracas on Friday, demanding Maduro’s release in the latest of a daily series of demonstrations.
“We don’t have to give one little drop of oil to Trump after all that he has done to us,” said one protester, Josefina Castro, 70, a member of a civil activists’ group.
“Our Venezuelan brothers died (in the attack), and that hurts.”</p><small>2026-01-10 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644251-dpm-dar-reaches-saudi-arabia-for-oics-extraordinary-moot-on-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar reaches Saudi Arabia for OIC's extraordinary moot on Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>
