Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said the force had taken prompt action and launched a search operation to arrest the suspects.
“The suspects stripped the boy, beat him with sticks, and filmed the assault before making the video go viral on social media,” Faheem said.
Quoting District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi, the spokesperson said he reacted strongly to the incident and said that “no powerful person can target the weak or poor class, the law is equal for everyone.”
He said the district police took immediate notice of the incident and directed the Hoti police to take strict action against the culprits.
According to Faheem, Hoti police Station House Officer Riaz Khan ordered immediate action and registered a case against two residents of Gali Bagh, Misri Abad Road.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at Hoti Police Station on Wednesday at the complaint of the victim under Sections 292 (sale, etc of obscene books, etc), 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation), 376 (rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation; if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Sections 37 (punishment for violence) and 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.
According to the complainant, the video was recorded one year ago.
Police added that special teams have been formed to arrest the suspects.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objectives of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” said Sahil.
Earlier this week, police in Mardan arrested four individuals in a case involving a viral video wherein the suspects were involved in the harassment of a teenage girl.
The action was taken on KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s instructions after the incident was highlighted by journalists.</p><small>2025-08-07 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07213203b092530.jpg?r=213243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929345/trump-to-sign-order-requiring-universities-to-disclose-admissions-data-on-race' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to sign order requiring universities to disclose admissions data on race</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order requiring universities to hand over admissions data to prove that they are not engaged in affirmative action efforts, the White House press secretary said in a post on X on Thursday.
In her post on X, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not give details on the order, such as the ramifications universities will face if they do not cooperate.
 






Since taking office for his second term, Trump’s administration has attempted to dismantle affirmative action policies at universities, launching dozens of investigations and threatening to cut off funding to schools that promote diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Trump has particularly taken aim at Harvard University since he took office, calling the institution a “joke” that teaches “hate and stupidity” and going as far as to freeze their government funding.
In May, Trump’s administration revoked Harvard’s right to enrol foreign students — more than a quarter of its annual enrollment.
Though the move was blocked by a judge, the US president stood by his decision.
“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”</p><small>2025-08-07 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07215759abca975.jpg?r=220658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929346/cricketer-haider-ali-suspended-by-pcb-amid-uk-police-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Cricketer Haider Ali suspended by PCB amid UK police investigation</strong></a><br><p>Cricketer Haider Ali was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday due to his involvement in an investigation being carried out by police in the UK, according to a statement.
The PCB announced last month that Saud Shakeel would lead an 18-member Pakistan Shaheens squad to tour England from July 17 to August 6 for two three-day and three 50-over matches. Ali was a part of the squad.
According to the statement, the PCB was informed about the investigation by the Greater Manchester Police regarding an incident that reportedly took place during the tour.
The nature of the incident was not immediately clear, nor were any details provided in the statement itself.
“In line with its duty of care and responsibility to ensure the welfare and legal rights of all its players, the PCB has ensured that Haider Ali has received appropriate legal support to protect his rights throughout this process,” the PCB stated.
The statement added that the cricket board acknowledged British legal processes and the importance of allowing an investigation to run its course.
“Accordingly, the PCB has decided to place Haider Ali under provisional suspension, effective immediately, pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation,” the statement read.
“Once the legal proceedings are concluded and all facts have been duly established, the PCB reserves the right to take appropriate action under its Code of Conduct, if necessary.”
The statement added that the PCB would not issue any further comment on the matter until it reaches its “legal conclusion”.

Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com: “A total of 20 fire tenders with two snorkels, five ambulances and water boozers were engaged in the fire that was controlled at 4pm.”
The rescue official detailed that they received information about the incident at 10am, following which hectic efforts remained underway till the fire was put out in the evening. However, cooling work continued.
 


“Some repair/construction work was also underway at the factory, whose structure ostensibly appeared to be weak,” Haseeb said. He added that eight factory workers who were removing goods, despite warnings from firemen not to do so, were injured as part of the building collapsed.
“They did not give any heed to such warnings, probably [because] they were under strict instructions from the factory management to remove the goods from it and shift the same to a safer place,” the Rescue 1122 official explained.
According to the rescue spokesperson, the factory staff told the firemen that some welding work was ongoing in the five-storey building’s basement, which triggered the fire. Further investigation into the incident was underway.
Haseeb noted: “It was a vast area and wind direction was heavy, which caused rapid spread of the fire, and resultantly, three adjoining factories also caught fire.”
While the structure of those three factories was intact, they sustained damage. However, the first building from which the fire originated was completely destroyed.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson estimated there were 1,200 workers who worked in the said factories, and those present on the site were evacuated safely.
Haseeb said some fire tenders were dispatched initially, but realising the gravity of the problem, more fire tenders were called from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122.
“The injured were taken to a nearby hospital via Edhi ambulance,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement earlier today.
Earlier in the day, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the fire and directed officials to take immediate steps to save people on a priority basis.
 






He directed all fire brigades and rescue agencies to take immediate action, while Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi was tasked with a thorough inquiry into the cause.
The chief minister assured factory owners and workers affected by the incident of full assistance.
CM Shah was informed that many employees were present inside the factory when the blaze broke out, but rescue teams successfully evacuated all personnel safely.
The chief minister was informed that one individual was injured during the building collapse and issued directives to provide immediate medical aid to the victim.

The nuclear-armed rivals exchanged artillery, drone and air strikes in May, after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for a deadly attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. The four-day confrontation came to an end when US President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire.
In a post on X, Netanyahu announced that he met the Indian ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, in Jerusalem today, where the pair “discussed strengthening and expanding cooperation between Israel and India, particularly in the fields of security and economics”.
“Afterward, I held a meeting with a group of senior journalists from India and answered their questions,” the Israeli leader wrote.
 






According to Indian television channel NDTV, Netanyahu confirmed the use of Israeli weapons during India’s military operations in May, including the deployment of HARPY drones and the Barak-8 missile, which is jointly developed with India.
“The things we provided before worked very well on the field… we develop our weapons in the field and they are battle-tested,” the Israeli PM was quoted as saying by NDTV. “They worked fine and we have a pretty solid foundation.”
The channel added that Israel was one of several countries that supported Operation Sindoor. Kobbi Shoshani, the Consul General in Mumbai, said it was “essential” to send a strong message to the terrorists.
“That (Operation Sindoor) was an action of self-defence, and I’m very proud of this operation,” Shoshani was quoted as saying.
According to Indian channel News18, New Delhi deployed the HARPY and SkyStriker loitering munitions “to great effect” during Operation Sindoor, reportedly targeting Pakistani air defence and surveillance systems.
 
 

Over the last decade, India has imported military hardware worth $2.9 billion from Israel, including radars, surveillance and combat drones, and missiles.
In 2019, India struck what it claimed was a “terrorist training camp” in Balakot with Israeli-made Rafael SPICE “smart bombs”, though local residents in the area claimed nobody had been injured or killed.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07193001f551411.jpg?r=193018' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929339/pm-shehbaz-calls-for-national-policy-to-address-rapid-population-growth' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls for national policy to address rapid population growth</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an immediate national policy to address Pakistan’s rapid population growth rate on Thursday.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost forty-five per cent of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
The prime minister termed the high population growth rate an “alarming trend” and said that immediate and coordinated policy action was required at a national level to address the issue. The World Bank reported Pakistan’s annual growth rate for 2024 as 1.5pc.
The statement came during a high-level meeting chaired by the premier at his office to review the challenges posed by Pakistan’s rising population and deliberate on effective strategies to manage it, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.
The meeting was also attended by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf and Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, along with senior officials from institutions.
“We need comprehensive planning to ensure our growing population, especially the youth, becomes a productive part of the economy,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
 






“A large segment of our population comprises young people, who are the most valuable asset for our country.”
He emphasised that the government was taking several initiatives to empower the youth and integrate them into the country’s economic mainstream.
“Opportunities are being created to enable our youth to play a central role in national development,” he added.
 
 

Speaking on gender inclusion, Shehbaz underlined the critical importance of women’s participation in the workforce.
“Women constitute a significant portion of our human capital. We must ensure greater employment opportunities for them,” he said.
The premier instructed the formation of a committee to develop a comprehensive and effective national policy, in close collaboration with provincial governments.
“A unified and strategic response is the need of the hour,” he said, calling for a coordinated federal-provincial framework to tackle population-related issues.
He also stressed the importance of launching a nationwide awareness campaign to educate citizens about the implications of unchecked population growth, especially in the context of sustainable economic development.
During the meeting, the premier was briefed on various proposals and recommendations to manage population growth. Officials stressed that any long-term solution would require active provincial collaboration and public engagement at the grassroots level.
Last month, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said that population growth in Pakistan has reached an alarming level. He highlighted the wide-ranging consequences of the demographic challenge, including over 25m children currently being out of school and overcrowding at government hospitals.
In June, parliamentarians unanimously approved a resolution on population stabilisation and vowed to table it in the National Assembly.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071903321801bae.png?r=192219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929336/muzaffargarh-police-arrest-2-suspects-for-allegedly-raping-disabled-teenage-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Muzaffargarh police arrest 2 suspects for allegedly raping disabled teenage girl</strong></a><br><p>Police on Thursday said they had arrested suspects for allegedly raping a deaf-mute and mentally disabled girl in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district.
Muzaffargarh police spokesperson Wasim Khan Gopang told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Rohilanwali area on Aug 4.
“Two suspects had been arrested within 24 hours of the incident.”
He said the 17-year-old girl was in the fields when one of the suspects allegedly caught her and raped her. “The suspect fled when locals reached the spot after hearing the girl’s voice,” he added.
In a first information report (FIR) dated Aug 6, seen by Dawn.com, the victim’s brother said that his sister was born deaf-mute and mentally disabled.
He said, “She went out of the house to relieve herself in the fields on Aug 4 around 05:30pm.”
The complainant detailed that the suspect, who was standing near the field, “forcibly grabbed the victim and raped her under a tree.”
The FIR named two passersby who heard the victim’s voice and caught the suspect raping her. “Upon seeing the men, the suspect ran away. Subsequently, the witnesses chased him for a long time, but he managed to escape,” it added.
The complainant said he, the victim’s father, and the witnesses went to the suspect’s father — who was also booked in the case as a co-accused.
“The suspect’s father started cursing and threatening me due to a previous fight and an ongoing land dispute,” the complainant said, adding, “I believe the suspect raped the girl on his father’s instructions.”
A case was registered at the Rohilanwali police station under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 376 (iii) (punishment for rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary in May.
In April, a 17-year-old girl died by suicide after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Muzaffargarh.
The same month, police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071858447c0fea5.jpg?r=190211' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/indias-modi-unwilling-to-compromise-on-agriculture-as-us-tariff-war-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi unwilling to compromise on agriculture as US tariff war escalates</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, a day after United States President Donald Trump announced 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods.
Washington announced the hike in levies on Wednesday, citing New Delhi’s purchasing of Russian oil, a key revenue source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market.
India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.
“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.
“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.
India has also refused to allow the import of genetically modified products.
 


Additionally, New Delhi fears that allowing the import of dairy products may upset the cultural and religious sensitivities of India’s majority Hindus, who revere cows as sacred.
It seems a far cry from India’s early hopes for special tariff treatment.
In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.
Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.
India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Modi, meanwhile, according to Indian media but not confirmed by officials, may visit China in late August, which would be his first visit since 2018.
Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping last met in Russia in October 2024.
Indian exporters warned that additional US tariffs risked making businesses “not viable”.
Stocks opened marginally lower on Thursday, with the benchmark Nifty index down 0.31 per cent after an initial 25pc US tariff came into effect.
India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars on discounted crude.
India’s foreign ministry condemned Trump’s announcement of further tariffs, calling the move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
 






S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said he feared a troubling impact.
“This move is a severe setback for Indian exports, with nearly 55pc of our shipments to the US market directly affected,” he said in a statement.
“The 50pc reciprocal tariff effectively imposes a cost burden, placing our exporters at a 30–35pc competitive disadvantage compared to peers from countries with lesser reciprocal tariff.”
Ralhan said “many export orders have already been put on hold” as buyers reassess sourcing decisions.
For “a large number” of small to medium-sized enterprises, profit “margins are already thin”, he said.
“Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable,” he added.
India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.
 
 

“If the extra 25pc tariff that President Trump has announced on imports from India remains in place, India’s attractiveness as an emerging manufacturing hub will be hugely undermined,” Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a note.
US spending drives around 2.5pc of India’s GDP, Shah said.
But a 50pc tariff is “large enough to have a material impact”, he added, with the resulting drop in exports meaning the economy would grow by closer to 6pc this year and next, down from the 7pc they currently forecast.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071732092cce89d.png?r=180339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929333/nepra-slashes-uniform-tariff-by-rs189-for-aug-oct' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.
A notification dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com said that the authority “decided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.
“Accordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.”
Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.
Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.
According to a separate Nepra notification — also dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com — the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.
Nepra decided that the FCA “shall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”, the notification read.
The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers’ bills based on the units billed to them in June.
“In case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,” Nepra added.
“While effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.”
In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh
“The actual fuel charges, as claimed by CPРА, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,” the notification read.
Today’s notifications come in the wake of a Nepra hearing discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.
The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p><small>2025-08-07 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07163308f557437.png?r=164658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929325/trumps-higher-tariffs-hit-major-us-trading-partners-sparking-defiance-and-concern' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s higher tariffs hit major US trading partners, sparking defiance and concern</strong></a><br><p>United States trade partners such as Switzerland, Brazil and India were still scrambling to get a better deal on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s higher tariff rates on imports from dozens of countries kicked in, raising the average US import duty to its highest in a century.
The US Customs and Border Protection agency began collecting the higher tariffs of 10 per cent to 50pc at 12:01am EDT (09:01am PKT) after weeks of suspense over Trump’s final tariff rates and frantic negotiations with major trading partners that sought to lower them.
The leaders of Brazil and India vowed not to be cowed by Trump’s hardline bargaining position, even while their negotiators sought a reprieve from the highest tariff levels.
The new rates will test Trump’s strategy for shrinking US trade deficits without causing massive disruptions to global supply chains or provoking higher inflation and stiff retaliation from trading partners.
After unveiling his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, Trump has frequently modified his plan, slapping much higher rates on imports from some countries, including 50pc for goods from Brazil, 39pc from Switzerland, 35pc from Canada and 25pc from India.
He announced on Wednesday a separate, 25pc tariff on Indian goods, to be imposed in 21 days, over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
 


“Reciprocal tariffs take effect at midnight tonight!” Trump said on Truth Social just ahead of the deadline.
“Billions of dollars, largely from countries that have taken advantage of the United States for many years, laughing all the way, will start flowing into the USA. The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail!”
Tariffs are ultimately paid by companies importing the goods and consumers of the end products.
Eight major trading partners accounting for about 40pc of US trade flows have reached framework deals for trade and investment concessions to Trump, including the European Union, Japan and South Korea, reducing their base tariff rates to 15pc.
Britain won a 10pc rate, while Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines secured rate reductions to 19pc or 20pc.
“For those countries, it’s less-bad news,” said William Reinsch, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
“There’ll be some supply chain rearrangement. There’ll be a new equilibrium. Prices here will go up, but it’ll take a while for that to show up in a major way,” Reinsch said.
Countries with punishingly high duties, such as India and Canada, “will continue to scramble around trying to fix this”, he added.
Switzerland’s government will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide its next move after President Karin Keller-Sutter returned home empty-handed from an 11th-hour trip to Washington aimed at averting the crippling US import tariff on Swiss goods.
A last-minute attempt by South Africa to improve its offer in exchange for a lower tariff rate also failed.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa held a telephone call with Trump on Wednesday and the two countries’ trade negotiating teams will have more talks, Ramaphosa’s office said.
 






Meanwhile, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told Reuters on Wednesday he wouldn’t humiliate himself by seeking a phone call with Trump even as he said his government would continue cabinet-level talks to lower a 50pc tariff rate on Brazilian exports to the US.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was similarly defiant, saying he would not compromise the interests of the country’s farmers after Trump introduced a 50pc tariff on Indian goods.
Trump’s order has specified that any goods determined to have been transshipped from a third country to evade higher US tariffs will be subject to an additional 40pc import duty, but his administration has released few details on how these goods would be identified or the provision enforced.

Revenues, price hikes
US import taxes are one part of a multilayered tariff strategy that includes national security-based sectoral tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, autos, steel, aluminium, copper, lumber and other goods.
Trump said on Wednesday the microchip duties could reach 100pc.
China is on a separate tariff track and will face a potential tariff increase on August 12 unless Trump approves an extension of a prior truce after talks last week in Sweden.
He has said he may impose additional tariffs over China’s purchases of Russian oil as he seeks to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Trump has touted a vast increase in federal revenues from his import tax collections, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying tariff revenues could top $300 billion a year.
The move will drive average US tariff rates to around 20pc, the highest in a century and up from 2.5pc when Trump took office in January, the Atlantic Institute estimates.
Commerce Department data released last week showed more evidence that tariffs began driving up US prices in June, including for home furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods and motor vehicles.
Costs from Trump’s tariff war are mounting for a wide swath of companies, including bellwethers Caterpillar, Marriott, Molson Coors and Yum Brands.
Toyota on Thursday said it expected a hit of nearly $10bn from tariffs on cars imported into the US as it cut its full-year profit forecast by 16pc.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07164331d41c39d.png?r=164418' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929328/pmd-issues-heavy-rain-warning-for-azad-kashmir-and-kp' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues heavy rain warning for Azad Kashmir and KP</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In a post on X, the PMD said at 3:30pm that a “rain-bearing weather system” was forming in the Poonch, Bagh, Haveli and Sudhnoti areas of Kashmir.
According to the post, the system was likely to cause “heavy rain with strong winds and thunderstorms” during the next 2-5 hours in the above-mentioned areas as well as Azad Kashmir’s Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Rawalakot, Bhimber, Mirpur and Neelum Valley.
 






Other areas that could come under the rain spell were KP’s Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur and Kohistan, along with Murree, Galyat, and surrounding areas.
The PMD has advised the public to take precautions and stay updated.
At least 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across KP since the start of the monsoon season in late June, according to the latest figures by KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
On Sunday, the nationwide death toll from monsoon rains rose to 299, up from 234, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
On Saturday, the PMD forecast more rain, with wind-thundershowers in the upper and central regions of the country over this week. The department asked provincial disaster management authorities and district administrations to take preventative measures against possible urban flooding.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617761-pm-seeks-national-policy-to-address-challenges-posed-by-rising-population' target='_blank'><strong>PM seeks national policy to address challenges posed by rising population</strong></a><br><p>

With the bill’s approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.
“The House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,” the NA’s official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.
As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.
 






“The legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,” Qamar, chairman of the NA’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.
“[…] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,” Qamar noted.
On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.
The Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill
The PPP government made the first attempt to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the second attempt in 2021.
The PML-N government had also discussed the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.
In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.
 
 

The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country’s strategic interests.
The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.
The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.
Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.
High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071513161f99a9b.jpg?r=152333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929316/550-point-gain-helps-psx-maintain-record-setting-spree' target='_blank'><strong>550-point gain helps PSX maintain record-setting spree</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its record-setting spree for a fifth consecutive session as it gained over 550 points on Thursday.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 992.53 points (0.68 per cent) to reach an intraday high of 146,081.02 points at 12:37pm, from the previous close of 145,088.49 points.
However, the shares soon declined slightly, standing at 145,613.09 points at 3:09pm, gaining 524.60 points (0.36pc) from yesterday. Witnessing fluctuations throughout the day, the index finally closed at 145,647.13 points, gaining 558.64 (0.39pc) from yesterday.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “Investor interest in companies posting strong corporate results or anticipated to report robust profitability has propelled the index to a new record high.
 
 

“Additionally, the recent imposition of an additional 25pc tariff on India has further bolstered market sentiment,” he added, referring to the United States’ recent levy on New Delhi, which will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc.
Commenting on the stock market’s future, Ashraf said: “We expect the KSE-100 to reach 165,215 [points] by December 25, supported by sustained earnings growth, declining fixed income yields, and a relatively stable rupee.”
Reacting yesterday to the PSX’s record-setting spree, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted it was a “reflection of investors’ confidence in government policies”.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617757-jirga-head-confesses-to-killing-woman-himself-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Jirga head confesses to killing woman himself in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

The summit would be the first between sitting United States and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021, and comes as Trump seeks to broker an end to Russia’s military assault on Ukraine.
Three rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv have failed to yield any progress towards a ceasefire, with the two sides appearing far apart in their demands to end the more than three-year-long conflict.
Trump said on Wednesday he was likely to meet Putin face-to-face “very soon”.
“At the suggestion of the American side, an agreement has been reached in principle to hold a bilateral summit in the coming days,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov was quoted as saying on Thursday by Russian state news agencies.
“We are now starting to work out the details together with our American colleagues,” Ushakov said.
The Kremlin said a venue had been agreed “in principle”, but did not indicate where the summit could take place.
“Next week has been set as a target date,” Ushakov added.
Zelensky calls for meeting
Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia launched its military offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.
Russian bombardments have forced millions for flee their homes and destroyed swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine.
Putin has resisted multiple calls from the United States, Europe and Kyiv for a ceasefire.
 
 

At talks in Istanbul, Russian negotiators have outlined hardline territorial demands if Ukraine wants Russia to halt its advance — calling for Kyiv to withdraw from territory it still controls and renounce Western military support.
Moscow has also repeatedly sought to cast doubt on Zelensky’s legitimacy and ruled out a meeting between the two leaders until after the terms of a peace deal have been agreed.
The announcement of the upcoming summit comes a day after US envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow.
Witkoff proposed a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but Russia did not respond to that proposal, Ushakov said.
“The Russian side left this option completely without comment,” he added.
Zelensky earlier on Thursday had refreshed his call for a meeting with Putin — which he says is the only way to make progress towards peace.
“We in Ukraine have repeatedly said that finding real solutions can be truly effective at the level of leaders,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
“It is necessary to determine the timing for such a format and the range of issues to be addressed,” he added.
 






The Ukrainian leader said on Thursday morning that he had planned to hold “several” conversations throughout the course of the day, including with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz as well as French and Italian officials.
“There will also be communication at the level of national security advisors,” Zelensky added.
“The main thing is for Russia, which started this war, to take real steps to end its aggression,” Zelensky added.</p><small>2025-08-07 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617751-lawyers-assault-techpreneur-zia-chishti-in-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Techpreneur Zia Chishti 'assaulted by lawyers' in IHC</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
“The blast was caused by a remote-controlled explosive device planted near a police vehicle [in the Rustam Bazaar],” Deputy Superintendent of Police Imranullah was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
Data from the incident report from the Wana District Headquarters Hospital showed two dead with 12 people with major injuries and eight with minor injuries.
A list of casualties issued by South Waziristan police spokesperson Anayat Khan identified two wounded policemen as Zubair Salaam Khan from the district’s Dabkot area and Fareedun Zubair from Birmal tehsil.
 
 

Lower South Waziristan’s District Police Officer (DPO) Tahir Khan had earlier told Dawn.com: “The wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital.”
Security forces cordoned off the area after the blast and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.
Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.
The incident follows residents’ complaints of the open display of firearms and the free movement of armed men in Wana’s Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.
Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.
Pakistan witnessed a slight uptick in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.
A day ago, a police constable was among two people injured when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle came under attack in the district’s Ladha tehsil.
Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among seven people martyred in two separate firing incidents in KP’s Karak and Peshawar districts.
 
 

On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.
Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were killed in a clash between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan’s Birmal tehsil.
Cop injured as late-night attack on Bannu police post repulsed
Separately, a cop was injured as police and civilians repulsed a late-night terrorist attack on the Khuni Khel police post in KP’s Bannu district.
“Police personnel responded strongly to the terrorist attack while showing bravery and determination,” Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi said in a statement.
“A policeman got injured by the terrorists’ firing and was taken to a hospital,” the officer added, noting that residents also joined the police and took up positions against the attackers.
DPO Kulachi stressed that the residents’ courage further heightened the police’s courage. “The net around the terrorists is being tightened,” he asserted.
According to APP, the assault was carried out using both light and heavy weaponry by terrorists from the outlawed TTP and Tehreek-i-Jihad Afghanistan (TTG), operating under the combined name Al-Ittihad al-Mujahideen.
 
 

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in July.
Last week, a fire exchange following a terrorist attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu left a constable and three terrorists dead, while three cops were injured.
Bannu has also seen multiple quadcopter attacks over the past month, which the military says are carried out by the TTP.</p><small>2025-08-07 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617741-at-least-seven-injured-as-fire-engulfs-factory-in-karachis-landi' target='_blank'><strong>At least eight injured as fire engulfs factory in Karachi's Landhi</strong></a><br><p>

The navy and ANF have previously worked in several intelligence-based joint operations to counter unlawful activities along the coast.
“The value of the seized consignment in the international market is approximately $38 million,” a press release from the navy said. “The consignment was being smuggled via the Arabian Sea to international destinations.”
It added that the seized items, comprising 1,100kg of hashish, 50kg of crystal meth, and 100kg of heroin, have been handed over to the ANF for further legal proceedings.
“This successful operation by the Pakistan Navy and ANF, resulting in [the] seizure of a large quantity of drugs, is a testament to PN’s resolve to fight against illegal activities as a national obligation,” the statement said.
“Pakistan Navy will continue to shoulder its responsibility to establish lawful order at sea.”
Last year, the navy seized a large quantity of narcotics in the north Arabian Sea during a regional maritime security patrol.
In February 2023, a joint intelligence-based counter-narcotics operation in the Arabian Sea resulted in the seizure of narcotics worth Rs3 billion.</p><small>2025-08-07 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617737-khawaja-asif-laughs-off-resignation-rumours-as-mere-whims' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif laughs off resignation rumours as mere whims</strong></a><br><p>

At least 43 people were killed in the conflict that ended last Tuesday, after a long-standing dispute over border temples boiled over into violence.
A truce was brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim — chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) regional bloc — after cajoling by United States President Donald Trump and a team of Chinese mediators.
The deal dictated a ceasefire, followed by a meeting of rival regional commanders, before defence officials held three days of talks in Kuala Lumpur that concluded with a joint statement on Thursday.
“Both sides agree to a ceasefire involving all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians and civilian objects and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas,” it said.
“This agreement must not be violated under any circumstances.”
 
 

In the first days of the truce, both Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of breaching the deal with limited skirmishes along their shared 800-kilometre border, though clashes quickly dropped off.
The joint statement signed by Thai Deputy Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit and Cambodian Defence Minister Tea Seiha said they agreed to continue a freeze on border troop movements and patrols.
“We are here for a detailed ceasefire arrangement to stop bloodshed and the suffering by soldiers and civilians of both sides,” Tea Seiha told reporters at a press conference.
“The steps are life-saving measures and lay groundwork for restoring confidence, trust, and normalcy between our two countries.”
The statement scheduled another meeting within a month and said both sides would also “agree to refrain from disseminating false information or fake news in order to de-escalate tensions”.
“In order for our discussions today to result in concrete outcomes, both sides needed to show cooperation and sincerity,” Natthaphon told reporters.
The contested temples are claimed by both nations because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia’s French colonial administrators in 1907.
This month’s clashes were the deadliest in the region in over a decade and caused more than 300,000 people to flee combat areas on both sides of the border.</p><small>2025-08-07 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617735-will-august-bring-a-four-day-holiday-stretch-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Will August bring a four-day holiday stretch next week?</strong></a><br><p>

On Wednesday evening, a major rescue operation was launched after a section of the emerald mine collapsed, trapping multiple workers underground. According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.
“Rescue 1122 medical teams are providing immediate medical assistance to the rescued workers,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told Dawn.com. “The operation continued for several hours after the mine collapsed, in which more than 40 personnel participated.”
The rescue operation was led by District Emergency Officer Swat Rafiullah Marwat, as per Faizi.
“The trained personnel and modern equipment of Rescue 1122 made the operation successful,” Faizi said.
Meanwhile, the army was also involved in the rescue operation, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
“As soon as the incident was reported, Pakistan Army teams were immediately dispatched to the site,” it said. “After relentless efforts, all the trapped workers were safely rescued,” the report added.
 






Mining in Swat’s lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at serious risk.
The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.
Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has seen a boom, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju.
In November, two workers were killed after elevator in an emerald mine collapsed. The tragic incident occurred when an elevator rope snapped, causing two workers to fall to their death.</p><small>2025-08-07 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071209096a7409f.jpg?r=120954' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929292/khawaja-asif-dismisses-rumours-of-him-resigning-as-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif dismisses rumours of him resigning as defence minister</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday refuted rumours circulating on social media that he had stepped down from his position following a controversy.
Asif clarified the matter after an X user named Zubair Ali Khan, in a series of posts on the platform late Wednesday night, alleged that the defence minister had handed in his resignation over a controversy but had withdrawn it and was now unreachable.
Replying to the post that levelled the allegations against him, Asif wrote:
“With apologies, this gentleman has written his wishes in this tweet. Not reality.”
He shared a screenshot of the post thread, edited with a red stamp marking it as “FAKE”.
 






The X user, a former journalist, had alleged that the minister resigned due to “intensified controversy regarding the arrest of the additional deputy commissioner revenue (ADCR) of Sialkot a few days ago on charges of alleged financial corruption”.
“In the resignation sent to Dr Tauqeer Shah, advisor to the prime minister’s office, Khawaja Asif stated that either the ADCR should be released or his resignation should be accepted,” the post alleged.
 






Khan also suggested that an “influential person” was behind the arrest, who was a subordinate of the defence minister’s department.
Later, he posted an update, further alleging that Asif and former premier Nawaz Sharif had held a meeting in Murree, during which the defence minister was persuaded to withdraw his resignation on the PML-N president’s advice.
“After the meeting, Khawaja Asif is out of reach to everyone; neither any minister nor any journalist can contact him. Khawaja Asif has turned off all his numbers and has moved to an unknown location!” he alleged.
 






The rumours spread after Asif said that a large portion of Pakistan’s bureaucracy was seeking shelter and citizenship in Portugal with billions in hand.
“More than half of the bureaucracy of our dear homeland has already acquired property in Portugal and is preparing to obtain citizenship,” Asif said in a post on Tuesday.
“These are well-known bureaucrats. Yet, after devouring billions of rupees, they are comfortably living a retired life.”
He added that politicians “eat the leftovers and make a fuss, with neither plots nor foreign citizenship because they have to contest elections”.
“The largest role in providing shelter to bureaucracy and other elites in Portugal is being played by Mr Virk”, he said.

The Senate committee headed by ruling PTI’s Ali Zafar issued the directives after it was informed by the Ministry of Interior that 689 cases had been registered under the Peca law throughout the country, including nine FIRs [First Information Report] registered against journalists.
According to an official handout, the committee received a detailed briefing from officials of the information and interior ministries regarding the number and nature of cases registered under Peca since its passage from the parliament in January, with a special focus on journalists, media professionals, digital content creators, and social media activists.
 






The committee was further informed that only one journalist had been arrested while seven were out of the country.
The committee directed the interior ministry to provide details of the FIRs lodged against the journalists and their complete reason in the next meeting. The committee also discussed the long-standing issue of delayed salaries and pensions of Pakistan Television (PTV) employees.

The committee’s chairman expressed serious concern over the situation and directed the concerned officials to provide detail and rationale for recruiting the employees during last five years in the ministry, considering the financial position of it.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar assured the committee that he would personally follow up on allegations of Rs1.24 billion embezzlement in the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
 
 

Responding to a query raised by Senator Sarmad Ali, who asked why an FIR had not been lodged despite the passage of over ten months since the misappropriation was unearthed.
The minister told the committee that the scam, involving misappropriation of Rs1.24bn in provident fund and employee-related expenses, was uncovered by the APP managing director.
He assured the committee that he would pursue the case himself for registration of an FIR against those responsible.

Residents told Dawn on Wednesday that the Jirga-TTP talks, which had been continuing for the last six days and were meant to convince terrorists to leave the region for Afghanistan, had not only led to the postponement of the Operation Sarbakaf planned by security forces in 16 Lowi Mamund areas but also helped normalise situation in many villages to some extent.
They said the Laghari Bazar, a major commercial centre in the tehsil, reopened on Wednesday after remaining closed since July 29 due to the curfew imposed by the district administration in those areas for the launch of the Operation Sarbakaf to flush out terrorists, who were present in the region for several weeks.
 
 

Attributing normalcy to the ongoing Jirga-TTP dialogue, the residents said they were relieved to see life slowly return to normal in many areas.
“We are thrilled to see normalcy gradually return to our areas, which were plagued by uncertainty over the last week,” said Asmat Khan of Tarkho area.

He said the credit for normalcy largely went to members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga.
Ihsan Khan, a trader in Laghari Bazaar, told Dawn that almost all shops in the bazaar remained open on Wednesday.
“The entire population, especially Laghari Bazaar traders, were overjoyed to see things returning to normal after a week of unrest,” he said.
The residents said public transport vehicles had also resumed plying many areas, especially on the Inayat Kallay-Laghari Road, a main artery of Lowi Mamund tehsil that connected the area with rest of the district.
They hoped that the situation would further improve after the Jirga-TTP talks yielded results.
 
 

Meanwhile, around 800 families from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil had so far been displaced from their native villages to safer areas due to the uncertain situation.
According to residents and non-governmental organisations, those families, mostly from Tharkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanato and Zagai, have left their homes on July 30, a day after the security forces launched Operation Sarbakaf against terrorists in the region.
They claimed that almost the entire population in the affected areas had been displaced.
Reports suggest that most displaced people have moved to different areas of Khar tehsil, including Khar town, Sadiqabad town, Inayat Kallay, Umary, Tang Khata, Loe Sam, Yousafabad and Khazana. Many of them have been accommodated in guesthouses by landlords, tribal elders and well-off individuals free of charge.
Moreover, humanitarian organisations Al-Khidmat Foundation, Pakistan Red Crescent Society and JUI-F have established relief camps where displaced people get food and essential commodities.

A crackdown on dollar smuggling launched on July 23 has led to a minor depreciation of around Rs3 in both the open and interbank markets. However, this has done little to bridge the gap between market sentiment and official expectations. The dollar continues to trade above Rs280, and a noticeable shortage has emerged.
In recent meetings held in Islamabad with banks, currency dealers, and jewellers, authorities reportedly reiterated their desire to bring the dollar down to Rs250. However, participants in the meetings described the target as unrealistic. Some bankers estimate the real market parity to be closer to Rs281.
Currency dealers say major foreign currencies — including the US dollar, British pound, and euro — are largely unavailable. “You might find a few hundred dollars at some counters, but most dealers are facing acute shortages,” said a senior dealer from an ‘A’ category exchange company.

Market pushback thwarts govt’s bid to bring greenback down to Rs250

While Malik Bostan, President of the Forex Association of Pakistan, recently dismissed reports of a currency shortage and claimed readiness to meet demand, most dealers disagree.
 
 

Many suspect that an illegal parallel market has resurfaced, where the dollar is selling at higher rates than those quoted by the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
On Wednesday, ECAP quoted the dollar at Rs285.15 in the open market and Rs282.87 in the interbank.
“There is no real shortage — the resistance to price controls is fuelling the perception of one,” said a senior interbank market analyst.
Atif Ahmed, a dealer operating in the interbank market, explained that banks with State Bank approval to sell dollars to importers are prioritising their own clients and setting higher rates acceptable to buyers. “Opening a letter of credit (LC) for $0.5 million has become a tough task for importers,” he added.
 
 

Although imports in FY25 have increased, indicating a relatively easier import regime than last year, analysts believe the current forex dynamics will make it difficult to achieve the Rs250 target. While the rupee may briefly strengthen into the 270s, sustained appreciation appears unlikely.
“The economy does not support a stronger rupee at this stage,” said a senior banker. “We remain dependent on the US dollar’s performance in global markets — and even though it has weakened slightly in 2025, that won’t be enough to pull the rupee to Rs250.”

During Wednesday’s proceedings, the Nat­ional Assembly passed the Societies Regis­tration (Amendment) Act 2025, allowing religious seminaries to get registered with the authority of their choice — the federal education ministry’s Directorate Gene­ral of Religious Education (DGRE), or their relevant DC office under the Societies Act 1860.
The new amendment is an addition in section 21-(C) of the law, allowing religious seminaries to choose which body they want to register themselves with. It has already been approved by the Senate.
The law became a bone of contention bet­ween the JUI-F and the ruling coalition after President Asif Ali Zardari reportedly withheld presidential assent on the bill last year.
 
 

The bill sailed through the Senate on Oct 20, 2024 and was okayed by the National Assembly the following day. At the time, the government had supported its passage in return for the JUI-F support’s on the 26th Amendment.
But the Maulana and his coterie — which included the heads of Shia, Barelvi, Deobandi, Ahle Hadith and Jamaat-i-Islami-affiliated seminary boards — were not pleased with the new requirement of having to re-register themselves.
On the other side of the spectrum were clerics led by Raghib Naeemi — the head of the country’s Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — who support registration with the education ministry.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan Ulema Council Chairman Allama Tahir Ashrafi said that since seminaries provide education, they should be under the education ministry.
“This decision has averted the conflict among the clerics and we have respected their choice, despite the fact that we have a clear majority in this sector with 10 seminary boards, and a majority of the 18,600 madressahs are under these boards,” he added.
But a legal lacuna threatens the smooth sailing of this legislation; the federal law known as the Societies Act 1860 no longer applies to provinces after it was repealed following the 18th amendment and replaced with a local law.
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza expressed concern over the government’s attitude on the matter, saying that currently, seminaries across the country were not “unregistered”, many were also facing issues such as the blocking of their bank accounts.
“The provinces repealed the Societies Act after 2019, we have had several meetings with the Balochistan government and they are waiting for approval from the federal government in this regard,” Senator Murtaza added.

Sources said this would be a return visit, following a trip to Pakistan by Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), in late July.
In a press statement issued on Aug 4, CENTCOM recalled Gen Kurilla’s recent visit to Pakistan and other countries in the region.
During the visit, Gen Kurilla was also conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Milit­ary) by the Pakistani government.
Field Marshal Munir previously visited Washin­gton in June, when he was hosted by President Don­ald Trump for lunch at the White House — an unprecedented gesture typically reserved for visiting heads of state or government.
There was no official word on the visit from Inter- Services Public Relations or Pakistan’s embassy in Washington, but during his previous, the army chief had hinted that he expected to return to the US again later in the year.
The development comes just over a month after the US general described Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in counterterrorism efforts during a congressional hearing, where he also praised Pakistan’s role “in promoting peace and stability” in the region.
No designs on Presidency
Separately, the ISPR chief has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president, Dawn.com reported.
His statement follows a similar rebuttal by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told The Econo­mist in a recent interview that talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’.
