Trump said that there was no “immediate peace” on the horizon in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in 2022 — following what he described as a one-hour and 15-minute call with the Russian president.
On Iran, Trump said that Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused the Islamic republic of “slow walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a deal.
The call came three days after Ukraine conducted a massive, daring drone attack against Russian military airbases, saying it had destroyed several Russian nuclear-capable bombers worth billions of dollars.
Trump said that he and Putin had “discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides”.
“It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Trump said in his post.
Trump did not say whether he had warned Putin off any such retaliation against Ukraine, which Washington has supported to the tune of billions of dollars in its fight against Russia.
‘Definitive answer’
The Republican has repeatedly alarmed Kyiv and Western allies by appearing to side with Putin over the war, and had a blazing Oval Office row with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
But Trump has also shown growing frustration with Putin as Russia has so far derailed the US president’s efforts to honour a campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours, even if he never explained how this could be achieved.
The call between Trump and Putin did, however, show that Washington and Moscow may be eying cooperation on another key global issue — Iran.
Trump said he believed they were both “in agreement” that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon, and that time was running out for Tehran to respond to US offers of a deal.
“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” Trump said.
The US president added: “It is my opinion that Iran has been slow walking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!”
Putin told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian that Moscow was ready to help advance talks on a nuclear deal, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier today that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interest, amid sharp differences over whether Tehran can continue to enrich uranium.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607793-us-diplomat-underscores-enduring-pakistan-us-ties-at-independence-day-celebration' target='_blank'><strong>US diplomat underscores enduring Pakistan-US ties at Independence Day celebration</strong></a><br><p>

The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.
In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.
 






It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC’s Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.
The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC’s working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.
The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.
“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” the press release said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.
Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.
Pakistan began a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.
This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.
Elected in June to replace Japan, Pakistan occupies one of the two Asia-Pacific seats on the UNSC. It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.
While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.
Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607782-pakistan-elected-vice-chair-of-unscs-counter-terrorism-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan elected vice chair of UNSC's Counter-Terrorism Committee</strong></a><br><p>

Two boys were found dead in a metal trunk of a house after both went missing in Kassoki village of Hafizabad district. Two uncles of one of the deceased boys, and their three accomplices, were among the suspects and police had arrested two of them.
Police had registered a case against four nominated and two unidentified suspects and started an investigation.
Hafizabad Crime Control Department (CCD) Deputy Superintendent of Police Ijaz Ahmed told Dawn.com today that one of the uncles was in CCD custody when the incident occurred. “The suspect drowned and his dead body was later recovered from the canal,” he added.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Hafizabad’s Kasoki Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Ali Kamran under Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“During an interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime, saying that he had physically tortured the victims with a wooden bat,” the FIR said, adding that he hid the bat in his living room.
It added that the police were on their way with the suspect to recover the bat when the vehicle slowed down near a canal near Kariala village after approaching a pothole, where the suspect removed the handcuffs from his right hand. The FIR said the police tried to stop the suspect but he jumped out of the vehicle and ran towards the bushes.
As the police were chasing after the suspect, they heard a splashing sound, the FIR said and added that the police called on him, but the suspect kept moving forward in the water and disappeared.
Last month, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
The Punjab Home Department recently launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children. The campaign, called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’, was created “to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors”.</p><small>2025-06-04 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041819343e0efdb.jpg?r=195830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915401/pm-shehbaz-invites-opposition-leader-to-consult-on-new-chief-election-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz invites opposition leader to consult on new chief election commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent’s term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.
The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP)  exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
The 26th Amendment allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.
In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub — seen by Dawn.com — the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).
“In term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,” the letter read.
“In view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.”
No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.
Disqualification reference
Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.
Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq forwarded a reference seeking Ayub’s disqualification to the ECP.
The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.
A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.
“The budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,” he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.
Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker’s reference. The commission granted Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.
In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader’s lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.
 






Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference “without using their brains”.
“The speaker did not consult me about this reference,” he said. “In the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.”</p><small>2025-06-04 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04205154edd0112.jpg?r=221611' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915413/saudi-arabia-using-ai-and-real-time-translation-to-open-haj-to-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia using AI and real-time translation to open Haj to the world</strong></a><br><p>The world’s largest gathering of people, and perhaps it’s the world’s largest test of communication, takes place in holy sites in Saudi Arabia, where more than two million pilgrims from 180 nations converge for Haj.
With those pilgrims come hundreds of languages, dialects, and customs, making effective communication profoundly challenging.
According to a press release from the Saudi Ministry for Haj and Umrah, the kingdom is “rewriting the rules of communication at Haj”, making broad use of AI translation tools at the core of a pilgrimage built on clarity, access, and spiritual depth.
“One of the most powerful examples came during the Arafat sermon, a central and emotionally resonant moment of Haj,” the press release read. “This year, the sermon was translated in real-time into 35 languages, allowing millions around the world — and every pilgrim on the ground — to hear the message of unity, compassion, and faith in their own tongue”.
According to the ministry, the broadcast was enabled by advanced AI systems under the General Authority for the Care of the Two Holy Mosques, exemplifying “how technology and tradition can harmonise to elevate spiritual experience”.
“Translation is not simply a technical feature—it is a spiritual bridge,” the ministry said.

Initiatives like ‘Smart Haj’ and the ‘In their languages’ programmes have allowed Saudi Arabia to ensure multilingual support at nearly every point of the pilgrimage.
Pilgrims use the Nusuk App to navigate along their journey in multiple languages. Its AI-powered Personal Assistant delivers real-time voice translation, allowing pilgrims to ask for help, understand procedures and communicate with worshippers and service teams seamlessly, according to the press release.
“Manara, a voice-activated robot, offers religious guidance in 11 languages, answering common questions with clarity and cultural sensitivity,” the ministry added.
“On the ground, field teams use AI-powered devices that understand both speech and images, enabling quick, precise communication in each pilgrim’s native language. These tools don’t just make things easier, they help every pilgrim feel understood, included, and supported in real-time.”
The ministry said Saudi Arabia’s commitment to inclusive communication also extends to the Holy Quran.
“Translated copies are widely distributed across the Grand Mosque, allowing pilgrims to reflect on sacred verses in their own languages. In these most sacred spaces, worship becomes deeply personal and universally accessible,” it stated.
The ministry added that in terms of medical emergencies or crowd management, AI-powered translation is proving to be life-saving.
“Instant, accurate communication across dozens of languages is essential to maintaining safety and order during one of the world’s most densely populated religious gatherings,” it said.

“By placing real-time translation at the core of the Hajj experience, Saudi Arabia is creating a global case study for how technology can enhance, not replace, faith,” the press release said.
“What was once a logistical challenge is now an opportunity to deepen spiritual connection. In bridging languages, the kingdom is also bridging hearts. Through thoughtful innovation, Haj is not only more accessible, but it’s more connected, more human, and more spiritually alive than ever before.”
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Last month, the Saudi Health Ministry launched a health awareness kit, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims and last month, the Saudi government announced that its 937 Health Call Centre was offering multilingual support to Haj pilgrims around the clock. Both of these services can be availed in Urdu.

Troops and tanks forcibly cleared peaceful protesters from Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, after weeks-long demonstrations demanding greater political freedoms. The exact toll is unknown, but hundreds died, with some estimates exceeding 1,000.
China’s communist rulers have since sought to erase any public mention of the crackdown, with censors scrubbing all online references.
Police were seen by AFP on Wednesday at the entrance to Wan’an Cemetery, a site in west Beijing where victims of the crackdown are known to be buried. Officers were also posted at several intersections leading into Tiananmen Square.
On Wednesday evening, a line of buses and a cherry picker partially blocked screens at the German and Canadian embassies showing images of candles, a symbol commonly used to pay tribute to Tiananmen victims.
‘Never forget’
Rubio said in a statement that the “world will never forget” what happened on June 4, even as Beijing “actively tries to censor the facts”.
“Today we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,” Rubio said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian hit back during a briefing in the capital, saying Beijing had “lodged a solemn protest” over the American politician’s comments, which “maliciously distort historical facts … and seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs”.
Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te echoed Rubio’s remarks, vowing to preserve the memory of victims of the bloody crackdown.
“Authoritarian governments often choose to be silent and forget history; democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who have contributed to the ideal of human rights and their dreams,” Lai said on Facebook.
China claims Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to seize the democratically run island by force.
‘Reaffirm our commitment’
In Hong Kong, jailed activist Chow Hang-tung began a 36-hour hunger strike on Wednesday, a dogged attempt to individually commemorate the anniversary in a city that once hosted huge public remembrances.
The former lawyer used to help organise an annual vigil that drew tens of thousands to the city’s Victoria Park.
Hong Kong had been the only place under Chinese rule where commemoration of the crackdown was tolerated. Slogans at the candlelight vigil sometimes called for democracy in China and an end to one-party rule.

But after huge and sometimes violent protests roiled the city in 2019, Beijing brought in a wide-ranging national security law that has quashed political dissent.
The public memorial has effectively been banned and Chow imprisoned, facing a potential life sentence on subversion charges.
On Wednesday, AFP journalists saw at least seven people taken away by police around Victoria Park, including two schoolgirls holding white flowers — which often signify mourning in Chinese culture — and a man standing in silent tribute. Some people were stopped and searched by police.
“It’s a shame that there’s no more [vigils] … In fact, no one will ever forget [the vigils],” a man named Yuen, 49, who did not give his first name, told AFP.
Over the last few years, activists have been detained for “offences in connection with seditious intention” around the anniversary.
In a social media post, Chow said her hunger strike would “commemorate this day and reaffirm our commitment” and urged authorities to apologise over her “wrongful” imprisonment.
“History tells us that [the apology] will likely take a very long time — the Tiananmen Mothers have been waiting for 36 years and still have not received an apology,” she said, referring to an activist group made up of families of victims of the crackdown.

A video featuring 87-year-old Zhang Xianling, whose 19-year-old son was killed in 1989, circulated online last week.
China’s authorities have never addressed the group’s plea for dialogue around the issue — instead, they have used all means to monitor and wiretap members of the Tiananmen Mothers, Zhang said.
“The lights in Victoria Park may have been blown out by the gales, but the sparks of justice will glow in the hearts of every conscientious person,” she added.
At a vigil on Wednesday in Taipei’s Liberty Square, 20-year-old American student Lara Waldron told AFP: “I feel like this June 4 is very close to me right now.
“As a college student, I’m of the age of many organisers and participants — people [who] lost their lives in Tiananmen. “</p><small>2025-06-04 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/042154074d8c18e.jpg?r=215533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915397/at-least-11-die-in-crowd-chaos-outside-indian-cricket-stadium' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 die in crowd chaos outside Indian cricket stadium</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 people died on Wednesday in a crowd surge outside a cricket stadium in the Indian city of Bengaluru, where fans were celebrating Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s first Indian Premier League title win, authorities said.
Thousands of people, some waving the home team’s red flag, lined the streets around the Chinnaswamy Stadium as the team arrived in a bus in the evening, TV channels showed, with some climbing trees and the stadium wall for a better view.
As the celebration proceeded, some people outside without passes tried to push through gates and there was further trouble between the perimeter and main arena, police said. Images from the scene showed people climbing over others.
At least 11 people were killed and 47 were injured in the incident, Karnataka state chief minister Siddaramaiah, who uses only one name, told reporters.
“At a time of celebration, this unfortunate event should not have happened. We are saddened by this. The fans that showed up were beyond our expectations,” he said.
One policeman carried an injured spectator to an ambulance, while people gathered around another lying seemingly unconscious on the ground. Visuals also showed some people receiving CPR.
Uncontrollable crowd
Police started caning people at one gate, leading to more chaos, said Mithun Singh, a software engineer among the crowd.
Naseer Ahmed, political secretary for the Karnataka chief minister, told broadcaster NDTV the crowd became uncontrollable and authorities were unable to make proper arrangements.
The team had given away free passes for the event through its website, but also warned that numbers would be limited.
Bengaluru Metro stopped services near the stadium, where the ceremony continued despite the turmoil outside.
Stampedes and other accidents are not uncommon when large crowds gather in India, including during religious events.
At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Hindu festival in January, as tens of millions gathered to take a dip in sacred waters on its most auspicious day.</p><small>2025-06-04 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04200315d8f46b0.jpg?r=200330' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915408/murder-of-three-children-in-nowshera-solved-suspect-arrested-say-police' target='_blank'><strong>Murder of three children in Nowshera solved, suspect arrested, say police</strong></a><br><p>Nowshera police on Wednesday arrested the prime suspect in the murder of three children last month, with the alleged killer revealed to be the victims’ grandmother, according to a statement issued by Nowshera police.
In May, a family suffered from health problems after consuming food believed to be contaminated, resulting in the death of three children in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah told Dawn.com, “The family had consumed Mithai [sweets] with tea at night, after which their condition deteriorated. Three siblings died after consuming poisonous food. Their mother was in critical condition.”
According to Wednesday’s statement, police formed an investigation team to probe the case, which was registered on May 19 upon the complaint of the victim’s father. An inquiry was launched under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) (police to inquire and report on suicide, etc).
“District Police Chief Abdul Rashid formed an investigative team led by SP (Superintendent of Police) Alamzaib Khan and assigned them the task of ascertaining the facts of the case,” the statement read.
The team comprised Nowshera Cantt Circle Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Muqaddam Khan, Azakhel Station House Officer (SHO) Adil Syed and Investigation Officer Naik Zaman Khan.
“The complainant and his wife, while recording their statements under Section 164 of the CrPC (power to record statements and confessions), filed a formal claim against his mother, claiming that due to [a] domestic dispute, she had given his wife and children a poisonous substance, which caused their death,” the statement read.
Nowshera police said that the suspect had been arrested and that further investigation was underway.
Last week, a woman turned out to be the killer of her two minor children in the Rangpur locality of Gujrat, Punjab as A-Division police claimed to have resolved a mysterious double murder case.

Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran during decades of successive wars, seeking safety and better economic opportunities.
Both governments have grown weary of large migrant populations and ordered millions to leave under the threat of arrest.
Pakistan has launched a strict campaign to evict more than 800,000 Afghans who have had their residence permits cancelled, including some who were born in the country or lived there for decades.
According to the interior ministry, more than 135,000 Afghans left Pakistan in April, while around 67,000 departed in May and more than 3,000 were sent back in the first two days of June.
The number of returnees has slowed ahead of the Eidul Azha holiday later this week, but some Afghans were still crossing the main border points from Pakistan today.
“We left behind our orchards” and livelihoods, 21-year-old farmer Mohammad Wali told AFP near the Spin Boldak crossing.
“But we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity,’ so it’s better to return to our homeland now.”
 
 

The UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday voiced concern over a surge in Afghan families being deported from Iran, recording 15,675 crossing in May, a more than two-fold increase from the previous month.
Iranian officials have ordered Afghans without documentation to leave by July 6.
Nader Yarahmadi, from the Iranian interior ministry, said on state television that it would affect around four million of the more than 6m Afghans who Iran says are in the country.
The IOM said the influx across both borders threatens to strain Afghanistan’s already “fragile reception and reintegration systems”.
It again called for “all countries to immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans, regardless of their immigration status, until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place”.
Rise in border violence
Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Taliban government in 2021.
A campaign to evict them began in 2023, prompting hundreds of thousands to cross the border in a matter of weeks, fearing harassment or arrest. In total, more than one million Afghans have left Pakistan.
Islamabad has labelled Afghans “terrorists and criminals”, but analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to control militancy in the border regions.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afghanistan, confronting rising attacks by terrorists in Balochistan and the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 
 

The government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks and blames Kabul for allowing militants to take refuge on its soil, a charge Taliban leaders deny.
Some Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, and the deportation campaign has widespread support.
Pakistan is now threatening to lift the protection granted to the 1.3m Afghans holding refugee cards issued by the UN high commissioner for refugees at the end of June.</p><small>2025-06-04 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607764-karachi-to-experience-low-intensity-tremors-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to 'experience low-intensity tremors this week'</strong></a><br><p>

According to District West Police spokesperson Nabeel Ahmed Rajput, “A tanker driver attempted to kidnap a traffic official near the Malik Chandio Chowk area of ​​Manghopir Police Station.
“Instead of stopping at the checkpoint, the tanker driver tried to kidnap the traffic policeman,” he said, adding that the noise prompted a nearby police mobile to chase the tanker to stop it.
The statement also said, “An angry group of people, accompanying the driver, launched an attack, injuring three police officers by assaulting them with sticks and stones.”
The injured have been shifted to the hospital for immediate medical attention, the spokesperson said. He added that the police were present at the scene and the situation was under control.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Last week, three people lost their lives in separate road accidents in Karachi, according to the police.
In May, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.</p><small>2025-06-04 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0411080945477bc.png?r=111140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359/bilawal-led-delegation-reaches-washington-after-wrapping-up-ny-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</strong></a><br><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.
Pakis­tan had launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
 






It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.
According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.
 






Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.
“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.
The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.
It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.
Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.
“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.
He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.
“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”
Pakistan praised globally for our kinetic actions: FM DAR
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state visit, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.
“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.
While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.
 


Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.
He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.
SAPM Fatemi meets Putin’s foreign policy senior aide
Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, senior aide to the Russian president on foreign policy issues, and briefed him on the recent escalation in South Asia, outlining Pakistan’s position vis-à-vis India’s aggressive actions, especially unilaterally holding the IWT in abeyance.
“Besides these meetings, the SAPM gave two interviews to the leading Russian TV networks, expressing his candid views on the increasingly positive trends in Pakistan-Russia relations and recent escalation between Pakistan and India. He also had an extensive exchange of views with a group of academics and journalists from prominent print and electronic media. Furthermore, the SAPM was hosted by Valdai Discussion Club, a prestigious think-tank in Moscow, for a talk on June 4, on the recent developments in South Asia and Pakistan-Russia relations.
“Overall, the visit of the SAPM was highly successful, with several important official engagements and candid exchanges with parliamentarians, a think tank, several academics and journalists. It paved the way to explicitly share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent situation and other important issues, such as IWT to the Russian side.
“There was widespread appreciation for the manner in which Pakistan was enhancing its relations with Russia, in important areas of trade, investment, energy and connectivity routes,” the FO said.

The bill, which sought to protect the rights of children and eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, was signed into law by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from the religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law”.
A citizen, Shahzada Adnan, filed a petition through his lawyer, Advocate Mudassar Chaudhry, against the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025. The petition has been filed against the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Law and Justice, and the CII as respondents.
The petitioner said the law is in “clear conflict and repugnant to Sharia” and that is why it needs to be declared “un-Islamic, unconstitutional and against the fundamental of Islam”.
He reproduced several sections from the Act which he said should be impugned. The law relates to the registration of child marriage, the punishment for a male adult marrying a child, the punishment for child abuse, and the punishment for parents or guardians concerned in child marriage.
The petitioner maintained the law related to child marriage is against the Holy Quran and Hadith as well as the Constitution.
The petition read that in “accordance with the stated legislation the Islamic concept of marriage is totally negated as according [to the] injunction of Islam, age does not matter but puberty is the key [to the] ceremony of Nikah”.
It continued that the “impugned law [is] ultra vires and against the basic fundamental laws of Sharia.” The petition also cities verses from the Holy Quran.
The petition further reads that the “impugned law is against the commandment in the Quran” whereas in Islam, “marriage (Nikaḥ) is a sacred contract and a highly recommended act”.
The petitioner said the state legislative bodies did not consider the opinion of the CII that has declared the “impugned act as Islamic and against the spirit of Islam as well as the Constitution of Pakistan”.
It added that in Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence), “there’s no specific age mandated for marriage. However, the general principle is that both parties must have reached maturity and have the mental capacity to understand the responsibilities of marriage”.
It read that Islamic scholars generally “consider the age of 15-16 as the appropriate age for marriage due to its suitability.”
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman recently rejected the law and announced nationwide protest rallies, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.
“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised fornication,” Fazl said.
“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulema and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and Sunnah,” he added.
Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29. He said the party will host rallies to “create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance”.</p><small>2025-06-04 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041713273003a37.jpg?r=171502' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915388/irans-khamenei-dismisses-us-nuclear-proposal-vows-to-keep-enriching-uranium' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei dismisses US nuclear proposal, vows to keep enriching uranium</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against the country’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’”.
“Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,” Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
“The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100pc against our interests … The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he added.
“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.”
Khamenei said, “If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don’t have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,” because “nuclear power plants need fuel” to operate. “If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.”
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
‘Maximum pressure’
Reuters reported on Monday that Tehran was poised to reject the US proposal as a “non-starter” that failed to soften Washington’s stance on uranium enrichment or to address Tehran’s interests.
 
 

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the US proposal includes “an arrangement that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels” as the US and other countries “work out a more detailed plan intended to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon”.
It said the proposal would see the United States facilitating “the building of nuclear power plants for Iran and negotiate the construction of enrichment facilities managed by a consortium of regional countries”.
Iran has previously said it is open to temporary limits on its enrichment of uranium and is willing to consider the establishment of a regional nuclear fuel consortium. But it has stressed that such a consortium is “in no way intended to replace Iran’s own uranium enrichment programme”.
Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January, which included tightening sanctions and threatening to bomb Iran if the negotiations yield no deal.
Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. Iran’s clerical establishment, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions.
During his first term, Trump ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact’s limits.
Iran’s clerical establishment is grappling with multiple crises — energy and water shortages, a plunging currency, losses among regional militia proxies in conflicts with Israel, and rising fears of an Israeli strike on its nuclear sites — all intensified by Trump’s hardline stance.
Iran’s arch-foe Israel, which sees Tehran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has repeatedly threatened to bomb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Tehran has vowed a harsh response.
‘Less than satisfactory’
In its latest quarterly report last week, the IAEA said Iran had further stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium.
In a separate report, it also criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.
The reports came ahead of a planned IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna later this month which will review Iran’s nuclear activities.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.
The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by Israel.</p><small>2025-06-04 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607745-tycoon-tanweer-ahmed-donor-of-namal-but-no-link-with-pti-says-aleema-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Tycoon Tanweer Ahmed donor of NAMAL but no link with PTI, says Aleema Khan</strong></a><br><p>

Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the bullish momentum to the news of the approval of a new financial package between Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The ADB approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.
The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.
Additionally, Tawfik noted that stock valuations were trading at an “attractive level” due to the correction phase witnessed at the stock market earlier this week.
“Lastly, there is also some institutional buying which has increased liquidity,” she added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market has hit an all-time high as participants brush off any negative budget-related news flow.”
He explained that expectations were building that economic stability would persist and interest rates will gradually trend downward, allowing stock market price-to-earning (PE)  ratios to rerate upwards.
“We believe the market is gradually entering the second phase of the bull run — transitioning from the accumulation phase to the public participation or momentum phase — marked by increasing public involvement, rising stock market volumes, gradual PE multiple expansion, and clearer signs of economic recovery,” he stated, adding that investor confidence, media attention, and new IPO activity were expected to grow.
“Measures such as reduced taxation that boost corporate earnings, along with adherence to IMF guidelines, will further reinforce confidence,” Farooq highlighted, noting that steps towards mass digitisation would also propel stock market sentiment.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0415330429e449c.jpg?r=161421' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915384/modi-to-visit-occupied-kashmir-to-unveil-strategic-railway' target='_blank'><strong>Modi to visit occupied Kashmir to unveil ‘strategic railway’</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to make his first visit to occupied Kashmir since the conflict between the country and Pakistan began last month, inaugurating a ‘strategic railway’ service to the mountainous region, his office said on Wednesday.
 






Modi will visit the valley on Friday to open the Chenab Bridge, a 1,315-metre-long steel and concrete span that connects two mountains with an arch 359m above the river below.
“The project establishes all-weather, seamless rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country,” the Indian Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
Modi is expected to flag off a special train.
 
 

Last month, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan fought an intense four-day conflict, their worst standoff since 1999, before a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and launched a series of airstrikes on different Pakistani cities.
Anti-India groups have been fighting for decades for held Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan, and enjoy broad popular support.
The 272-kilometre Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway — with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges — has been constructed “aiming to transform regional mobility and driving socio-economic integration”, the statement added.
Its dramatic centrepiece is the Chenab Bridge, which India calls the “world’s highest railway arch bridge”.
While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in China.
Indian Railways calls the $24-million bridge “arguably the biggest civil engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history”.
The bridge will facilitate the movement of people and goods, as well as troops, that was previously possible only via treacherous mountain roads and air.
The train line could slash travel time between the town of Katra and Srinagar, the region’s key city, by half, taking around three hours.
The bridge will also revolutionise logistics in Ladakh, the icy region in India bordering China.
India and China, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Their troops clashed in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, and forces from both sides today face off across contested high-altitude borderlands.
The railway begins in the garrison city of Udhampur, the headquarters of the Indian army’s northern command, and runs north to Srinagar.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607728-pakistan-ready-for-dialogue-with-india-but-not-desperate-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for dialogue with India but not desperate: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

The US Department of Justice on Tuesday identified the pathogen as Fusarium graminearum, a fungus it said was classified in scientific literature as a potential agroterrorism weapon. In a statement, it said that the fungus causes “head blight” in some crops and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses globally each year.
 






According to an FBI criminal complaint, Zunyong Liu, 34, a researcher currently in China, brought the fungus into the US while visiting his girlfriend, Yunqing Jian, 33, in July 2024.
He admitted to smuggling in the fungus so he could conduct research on it at a University of Michigan laboratory where his girlfriend worked, according to the complaint.
The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the complaint, an examination of electronic communications between the two indicated that they discussed shipping biological materials and research being done in the laboratory prior to Zunyong’s arrival.
Yunqing and Zunyong were accused in the complaint of conspiracy, smuggling goods into the US, false statements and visa fraud.
Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office, said the pair’s actions “posed an imminent threat to public safety”.
Yunqing was expected to appear in court in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday.

He said Noorzai was on his way from Quetta to Tump on Wednesday morning, but did not provide further details.
Noorzai is from Quetta and has previously served as AC in different areas of the province.
In September 2016, Asad Khan Tareen, son of then-Balochistan’s Minister for Local Government Sardar Mustafa Tareen — who had been kidnapped in May that year — was recovered from an area of Qila Abdulla district close to the Pak-Afghan border.
Armed men kidnapped Asad Tareen in Pishin town on May 21 when he was returning from Cadet College Pishin, where he worked as a warden. He was reportedly taken across the border in Afghanistan.

Parts of Karachi experienced three more tremors on Tuesday morning, as the city has been shaken by 19 mild earthquakes over the past three days, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) officials said.
The tremors, all classified as low to moderate in intensity, ranged from 2.1 magnitude to 3.6 on the Richter scale. The strongest tremor, measuring 3.6, was recorded on Sunday, while the weakest was of 2.1 magnitude.
PMD Director General Mahr Sahibzad Khan, while speaking during Dawn News TV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, said Karachi will face low-intensity quakes for the next couple of days.
The Met chief claimed earthquakes are occurring in Karachi due to lack of ground water and illegal pumping by the so-called ‘tanker mafia’.
“Karachi has small fault lines in areas of Korangi and Malir that are causing minor earthquakes,” he said, adding that tremors were being felt in the areas close to the fault line.
“The main problem in Karachi is that there is no ground water. If you remove the hard rocks, there is only sand,” he added.  “There is a strong tanker mafia in Karachi. They take out water through pumping or other illegal means.”
He said the pumping of ground water is being done over the fault line which causes “induced earthquakes.”
He observed that the intensity of the quakes in Karachi has reduced over the past few days. He said the first quake measured 3.6 on Richter Scale but the one that struck today (June 3) recorded a magnitude of 2.6.
When asked about the collapse of the wall in Malir prison that led to a massive jailbreak, he said the prison’s wall collapsed because it was located close to the epicentre.
“It (Malir jail) was located near the epicentre. The intensity is greater in the areas near the epicentre,” he elaborated.
When asked if the tremors will continue in the upcoming days, the Met chief said the aftershocks will remain for the next few days until the seismic activity settles.
“The tremors will continue but not with high intensity. The fault line is not very active. They will end after two to three days,” he added.
When asked if the residents of the city should panic, he said there is “nothing to worry about for people of Karachi.”</p><small>2025-06-04 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041317192b6e450.jpg?r=134733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915372/million-plus-pilgrims-begin-haj-under-blazing-sun' target='_blank'><strong>Million-plus pilgrims begin Haj under blazing sun</strong></a><br><p>More than a million pilgrims joined Islam’s most important rite under a beating sun on Wednesday, as the Haj kicked off with the Saudi hosts scrambling to avoid last year’s 1,000-plus deaths in sweltering heat.
With the temperature expected to top 40 degrees Celsius, robed pilgrims slowly circled the Kaaba at the heart of Makkah’s Grand Mosque.
State media reported that others had begun arriving in the tent city of Mina on Makkah’s outskirts where they will stay overnight before the Haj’s high-point on Thursday — prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Holy Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) delivered his final sermon.
About 1.4 million pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of the Haj.
Authorities have ratcheted up heat protection measures such as extra shade to avoid a repeat of last year, when 1,301 people died as temperatures hit 51.8C.
On Wednesday, pilgrims will perform the tawaf — walking seven times around the Kaaba.
Pilgrims arriving on buses had begun already trickling into Mina on Tuesday afternoon, greeted by staff offering them coffee and dates.
“I am so happy, it’s such an amazing feeling,” said Reem al-Shogre, a 35-year-old Saudi performing the pilgrimage for the first time.
Following last year’s lethal heatwave, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials to improve protection.
Shaded areas have been enlarged by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands of additional medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Haj Minister Tawfiq al Rabiah told AFP last week.
Artificial intelligence technology will help process the deluge of data, including video from a new fleet of drones, to better manage the massive crowds.
Authorities said most of the deaths last year were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to air-conditioned tents and buses.
This year, they have cracked down on the unregistered, using frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt the Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Large crowds at Haj have proved hazardous in the past, most notably in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest Haj disaster.</p><small>2025-06-04 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607687-from-adiala-to-times-square-pti-escalates-rhetoric-jeopardises-peace-with-establishment' target='_blank'><strong>From Adiala jail to Times Square: PTI escalates rhetoric, jeopardises peace with establishment</strong></a><br><p>

During the meeting, the two officials also spoke about “Bitcoin integration, and the future of decentralised infrastructure”.
Bo Hines was appointed by President Trump in January 2025 to lead the national policy development on digital asset innovation, regulation, and emerging financial technologies, according to the statement.
In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.
Saqib is now responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
The meeting comes following Pakistan’s announcement of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, positioning the country as one of the first in Asia to incorporate Bitcoin into its sovereign asset strategy.
“I envision Pakistan to be a leader in the Global South for Digital Assets.” said Saqib. “From launching our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to unlocking national infrastructure for crypto mining and AI data zones, Pakistan is building a real framework for digital asset adoption and economic modernisation.”
The statement added that both sides expressed a shared interest in fostering collaboration between the US and Pakistan on digital asset innovation, regulatory coherence, and emerging financial technologies during the meeting.
“They also discussed ways to support innovation ecosystems that empower youth and accelerate economic inclusion through blockchain,” the press release added.
Saqib also met with the White House Counsel’s Office.
Pakistan’s broader Crypto strategy includes allocating two gigawatts to power Bitcoin mining and AI-driven data zones.
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.
An MBE, which stands for “Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire”, is awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.</p><small>2025-06-04 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041140154cd3f1c.jpg?r=114054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915363/14-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in North Waziristan operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Fourteen terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in an operation by security forces in North Waziristan district’s Datta Khel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday.
Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.
“On June 2-3 2025, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in the general area Datta Khel, North Waziristan District, on the reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The statement added that during the conduct of operation, the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “after an intense exchange of fire, fourteen Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Last month, security forces killed nine terrorists “sponsored” by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the ISPR.
In July last year, the government, through an official notification, designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna al Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-04 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607676-gang-selling-childrens-videos-on-dark-web-traced' target='_blank'><strong>Gang selling children's videos on dark web traced</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: The capital police on Tuesday announced the arrest of the suspect in the murder case of a social media influencer, who was gunned down at her house in G-13 on Monday.
Addressing a hastily-called news conference, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said after the murder of 17-year-old Sana Yousuf, seven police teams were formed under the supervision of DIG Operations Jawad Tariq. These teams conducted a technical investigation, analysing social media accounts and more than 300 call records. Footage from Safe City Islamabad and private cameras was also obtained.
The suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder.”

IGP says there was immense pressure on police, but identifying suspect was a complex process

The IGP said the murder of Sana caused a wave of concern across Islamabad and the entire country. The brutal killing of the young girl was a significant challenge for the police. There was immense pressure to arrest the killer, but identifying him was a complex process.
He added that a strong case would be built against the suspect, ensuring a thorough investigation and collection of solid evidence so that the competent court awards him the appropriate punishment.
The IGP held the press conference at Rescue 15 and was accompanied by DIG Mohammad Jawad Tariq and other police officers.
 
 

Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the suspect, the son of a retired grade-16 officer, and the victim had known each other for the last one year. The suspect came to Islamabad on the night between May 28 and 29 to wish her a happy birthday and reached her house in G-13; however, they could not meet due to unknown reasons.
Later, both the girl and the suspect talked on the phone with the latter complaining about her unavailability to meet him on her birthday. However, they decided to meet on June 2, and he again arrived in Islamabad. When he reached outside her house, she did not come out.
Somehow, the suspect managed to enter the house, where an argument ensued during which he pulled out a weapon and shot her, killing her on the spot.
At the time of the incident, the victim’s aunt was present in the house while her parents had gone out.
After registration of the case, the investigators collected CCTV footage from cameras installed around the victim’s house and from Safe City, which revealed that the suspect had reached Chungi No 26 and boarded a passenger vehicle to Faisalabad.
Geo-fencing of the area also confirmed the suspect’s presence at G-13 and later at Chungi No 26. Police conducted a raid in Faisalabad, arrested the suspect and brought him to Islamabad.
NCSW demands transparent investigation
Meanwhile, the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) condemned the cold-blooded murder of the young TikToker and said the heinous act was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted patriarchal violence that continues to deprive women and girls of their fundamental right to life.
NCSW Chairperson Ume Laila Azhar demanded an immediate, transparent and thorough investigation into the crime. She said the perpetrators must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
“We will not let this case be buried under social stigma, false narratives of honour, or procedural loopholes. This senseless killing highlights the vulnerability of women and girls, even in their own homes. We demand justice for Sana and her family, and expect the state to ensure accountability of the perpetrators.”
Burial in Chitral
The body of the victim was laid to rest in her ancestral graveyard in Chuinj village of Upper Chitral on Tuesday.
Touching scenes were witnessed during the burial as villagers and relatives burst into tears over the tragic death of the girl.
Her father, Yousuf Hassan, who works in a government office in Islamabad, said the Chitrali community residing in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar had started feeling insecure as incidents of cold-blooded murders had increased in the past few years.
Earlier, hundreds of people had gathered to condole with the bereaved parents in a hotel in Chitral city, where they stayed for an hour on Tuesday morning before leaving for the village in Upper Chitral with the body.

In a working paper for the federal budget 2025-26, the Planning Commission also attributed the lower-than-targeted GDP growth to a poor performance of the agriculture sector. “GDP growth for FY25 is recorded at 2.7pc against the target of 3.6pc, primarily due to a massive contraction in key commodity-producing sectors, including important crops, which witnessed a 13.5pc contraction due to adverse weather conditions, reduced rainfall, input challenges, and policy shift”, the Planning Commission candidly placed on record.
Last year, the government announced a lucrative minimum support price (MSP) for wheat, but the Punjab government subsequently withdrew its support for farmers, leaving them at the mercy of middlemen and market forces. The federal government, as part of the IMF negotiations, later announced its intention to end commodity market interventions and refrain from implementing minimum support prices.
The subsequent policy changes, including extended fertiliser subsidies, added salt to the farmers’ pain, causing input challenges as pointed out by the Planning Commission.

Planning Commission foresees higher food imports next year

“During FY25, the crop sector showed mixed trends as production of important crops declined by 13.5pc, whereas other crops showed growth of 4.8pc. Production of cotton declined by 30.7pc, maize by 15.4pc, sugarcane by 3.9pc, rice by 1.4pc, and wheat by 8.9pc”, the commission noted.
The outcome could not have been expected to be different. “Yields of sugarcane and rice declined despite a slight increase in cultivated area. This could be attributed to erratic weather patterns or input issues during the growing season”, the commission said, warning that the overall data highlighted falling yields and the need for better policy support and climate-resilient practices.
On top of that, cotton ginning contracted by 19pc in FY25 compared to a growth of 47.2pc last year. “This was mainly due to decline in cotton production and closure of ginning factories in the country”, the working paper reads.
This helped the federal government contain the expansion of net domestic assets to a marginal Rs145.6bn in 2024-25 compared to Rs1.588 trillion last year. “This was largely due to the government’s net retirement of SBP borrowings, reduced demand for budgetary support from scheduled banks owing to lower fiscal deficit and a net retirement of financing for commodity operations, mostly driven by repayment of loans availed for wheat procurement”, the commission said.
“It mainly reflects the impact of reforms in commodity operations to stem the accumulation of commodity debt. These measures included rationalisation of wheat procurement, gradual abolition of MSP” besides the timely payment of subsidies, and transitioning to targeted subsidies, mostly in the energy sector.
Conversely, the planning commission appreciated the livestock performance and gave its credit to the government. “Livestock maintained its growth streak to 4.7pc during current year compared to 4.4pc last year. This was mainly due to key initiatives like vaccination programmes for livestock, both by the federal and provincial governments” in the improvement in surveillance programmes and disease control mechanisms in the country.
This also had a cascading impact on manufacturing sector that underperformed, slowing from 3pc growth in the previous year to 1.3pc in FY2024-25 against a target of 4.4pc. The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector was a key contributor to this slowdown, which reversed its modest 0.9pc growth from last year and contracted by 1.5pc in FY2024-25, underscoring persistent weaknesses in industrial output and subdued demand.
LSM groups like food production, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products, iron and steel, electrical equipment, machinery, and furniture recor­ded a decline, which offset the growth in the output of tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, automobiles, and other transport equipment, indicating resilience in consumer-oriented and energy-related industries.
