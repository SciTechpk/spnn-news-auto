Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told Dawn.com that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in an explosion targeting the vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.
“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for treatment.
The DPO said that security was increased in the area and relief activities were underway.
The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid.
KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.
He contacted Khar DHQ’s district health officer and the medical superintendent to enquire about the well-being of those injured in the attack.
“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff have been alerted for first aid,” he said.
The health adviser assured the public that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.
KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).
He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department’s additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.
“A special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,” Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner’s vehicle.
Hameed said that teams were formed “to arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot”, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.
Those elements disturbing the country and province’s peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.
KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif strongly condemned the incident and said the loss of lives was regrettable.
“The KP chief minister has issued orders for an enquiry into the incident and to provide medical facilities to the injured,” Saif said.
“Those who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes and will be brought to justice.”
KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah also condemned the incident. He directed the district administration and health department to remain on full alert, provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and utilise all available resources to deal with the emergency situation.
Condemnations
President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the bomb blast and expressed his grief over the deaths.
The president also extended his condolences and sympathies to the victims’ families and offered prayers for the deceased.
“Terrorists are the enemies of humanity who target people,” Zardari asserted, reiterating Pakistan’s resolve to take “all possible measures to complete [the] eradication of the scourge of terrorism”.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the attack on X.
“I am deeply saddened by the martyrdom of Nawagai assistant commissioner, tehsildar and other officials in this blast,” he said in a statement.
“Terrorists are staunch enemies of the nation and country [and] do not want peace and tranquillity.”
Extending his prayers to the families of the deceased, Bilawal wrote, “Every individual in Pakistan is united in the war against terrorism.”
 






National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq also strongly condemned the incident.
He expressed deep sorrow and regret over the loss of lives and expressed solidarity with the affected families.
He denounced the targeting of AC Ismail’s vehicle as a “cowardly and shameful act”, urging that those responsible be brought to justice.

Last week, the Constit­utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.
Acting on the court’s verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its July 24 and 29 notifications from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.
In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.
After this process, the ruling coalition ach­ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224. The ruling coalition now has 233 seats.
The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies.
Reserved seats case
Through its March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls — of reserved seats.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, ECP and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p><small>2025-07-02 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02161859f239de9.jpg?r=162036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921637/iran-suspends-cooperation-with-un-nuclear-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran suspends cooperation with UN nuclear watchdog</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Wednesday formally suspended its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, a measure drawn up in the wake of unprecedented Israeli and US strikes on the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites.
The war between Iran and Israel, which broke out on June 13 and lasted for 12 days, has intensified tensions between Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On June 25, a day after a ceasefire took hold, Iranian lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in favour of the bill to suspend cooperation with the agency.
State media said today that the legislation had cleared the final hurdle and was in effect.
The text, published by Iranian media, states that the legislation aims to “ensure full support for the inherent rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran” under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and “especially uranium enrichment”.
The issue of enrichment was at the core of disagreements between Washington and Tehran in nuclear negotiations that had been derailed by the war.
Israel and some Western countries had for long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons — an ambition Tehran has consistently denied.
The text of the law did not specify concrete moves linked to the suspension of cooperation with the IAEA, whose inspectors have had access to declared nuclear facilities.
Following the parliament vote, the bill was approved by the Guardian Council, a body tasked with vetting legislation, before a final ratification from the presidency.
 
 

Iranian President “Masoud Pezeshkian promulgated the law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency”, state TV said today.
Iranian officials have sharply criticised the IAEA for what they described as the agency’s “silence” in the face of the Israeli and US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.
Germany said on Wednesday that Iran’s decision to suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog sends a “disastrous signal”.
“For a diplomatic solution, it is essential for Iran to work with the IAEA,” foreign ministry spokesman Martin Giese told reporters after Tehran formally enacted the suspension.
‘Deceptive and fraudulent’
Tehran has also lambasted the UN agency for a resolution adopted on June 12 that accuses Iran of non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.
Iranian officials said the resolution was among the “excuses” for the Israeli attacks.
 
 

Senior judiciary official Ali Mozaffari said today that IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi should “be held accountable” for what he called “preparing the groundwork for the crime” against Iran, referring to Israel’s air raids.
Mozaffari accused Grossi of “deceptive actions and fraudulent reporting”, according to Iranian news agency Tasnim.
Iran has rejected a request from Grossi to visit nuclear facilities bombed during the war, and earlier this week Pezeshkian decried his “destructive” conduct.
Iran has said Grossi’s request to visit the bombarded sites signalled “malign intent” but insisted there were no threats against him or against inspectors from his agency.
France, Germany and Britain have condemned unspecified “threats” against the IAEA chief.
Iran’s ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper has recently claimed that documents showed Grossi was an Israeli spy and should be executed.
‘Serious’ damage
On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the parliament vote to halt cooperation with the IAEA reflected the “concern and anger of the Iranian public opinion”.
The 12-day war began when Israel launched a major bombing campaign on Iran and killed top military commanders, nuclear scientists, and hundreds of civilians, with Tehran responding with waves of missiles and drones launched at Israel.
On June 22, Israel’s ally the United States launched unprecedented strikes of its own on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.
 
 

More than 900 people were killed in Iran, according to the judiciary.
Iran’s retaliatory attacks killed 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
US President Donald Trump said the US attacks had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme, though the extent of the damage was not clear.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has admitted “serious” damage to nuclear sites.
But in a recent interview with CBS’s Evening News, he said: “One cannot obliterate the technology and science… through bombings.”</p><small>2025-07-02 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612063-ruling-coalition-gets-lions-share-of-reserved-seats-as-ecp-implements-top-courts-order' target='_blank'><strong>Ruling coalition gets lion's share of reserved seats as ECP implements top court's order</strong></a><br><p>

The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.
Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at close, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.
The PSX extended its record-breaking rally for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts attributed to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said the increase in tax rate on income from debt securities, along with a change in the taxation structure for mutual funds to proportionate holdings of equities and fixed income, has resulted in inflows to equities from fixed income.
“Significant reduction in inflation rate — fell to a low of nine years — with improved outlook has increased the odds for further reduction in policy rate, which will help in continuation of flows towards equities,” he said.
The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a nine-year low of 4.49pc during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing disinflation, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.
Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.
“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,” Ashraf said a day ago.
In a recent statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100’s record close reflected growing confidence in the government’s economic policies. He described the index’s performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p><small>2025-07-02 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02144445354e1ea.jpg?r=144743' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921630/writing-is-thinking-do-students-who-use-chatgpt-learn-less' target='_blank'><strong>‘Writing is thinking’: Do students who use ChatGPT learn less?</strong></a><br><p>When Jocelyn Leitzinger had her university students write about times in their lives they had witnessed discrimination, she noticed that a woman named Sally was the victim in many of the stories.
“It was very clear that ChatGPT had decided this is a common woman’s name,” said Leitzinger, who teaches an undergraduate class on business and society at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
“They weren’t even coming up with their own anecdotal stories about their own lives,” she told AFP.
Leitzinger estimated that around half of her 180 students used ChatGPT inappropriately at some point last semester — including when writing about the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI), which she called both “ironic” and “mind-boggling”.
So she was not surprised by recent research, which suggested that students who use ChatGPT to write essays engage in less critical thinking.
The preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was shared widely online and clearly struck a chord with some frustrated educators.
The team of MIT researchers behind the paper have received more than 3,000 emails from teachers of all stripes since it was published online last month, lead author Nataliya Kosmyna told AFP.
‘Soulless’ AI essays
For the small study, 54 adult students from the greater Boston area were split into three groups. One group used ChatGPT to write 20-minute essays, one used a search engine, and the final group had to make do with only their brains.
The researchers used EEG devices to measure the brain activity of the students, and two teachers marked the essays.
The ChatGPT users scored significantly worse than the brain-only group on all levels. The EEG showed that different areas of their brains connected to each other less often.
 
 

And more than 80 per cent of the ChatGPT group could not quote anything from the essay they had just written, compared to around 10pc of the other two groups.
By the third session, the ChatGPT group appeared to be mostly focused on copying and pasting.
The teachers said they could easily spot the “soulless” ChatGPT essays because they had good grammar and structure but lacked creativity, personality and insight.
However, Kosmyna pushed back against media reports claiming the paper showed that using ChatGPT made people lazier or more stupid.
She pointed to the fourth session, when the brain-only group used ChatGPT to write their essay and displayed even higher levels of neural connectivity.
Kosmyna emphasised it was too early to draw conclusions from the study’s small sample size, but called for more research into how AI tools could be used more carefully to help learning.
Ashley Juavinett, a neuroscientist at the University of California San Diego, who was not involved in the research, criticised some “offbase” headlines that wrongly extrapolated from the preprint.
 
 

“This paper does not contain enough evidence nor the methodological rigour to make any claims about the neural impact of using LLMs (large language models such as ChatGPT) on our brains,” she told AFP.
Thinking outside the bot
Leitzinger said the research reflected how she had seen student essays change since ChatGPT was released in 2022, as both spelling errors and authentic insight became less common.
Sometimes students do not even change the font when they copy and paste from ChatGPT, she said.
But Leitzinger called for empathy for students, saying they can get confused when the use of AI is being encouraged by universities in some classes but is banned in others.
The usefulness of new AI tools is sometimes compared to the introduction of calculators, which required educators to change their ways.
But Leitzinger worried that students do not need to know anything about a subject before pasting their essay question into ChatGPT, skipping several important steps in the process of learning.
A student at a British university in his early 20s who wanted to remain anonymous told AFP he found ChatGPT was a useful tool for compiling lecture notes, searching the internet and generating ideas.
“I think that using ChatGPT to write your work for you is not right because it’s not what you’re supposed to be at university for,” he said.
The problem goes beyond high school and university students.
Academic journals are struggling to cope with a massive influx of AI-generated scientific papers. Book publishing is also not immune, with one startup planning to pump out 8,000 AI-written books a year.
“Writing is thinking, thinking is writing, and when we eliminate that process, what does that mean for thinking?” Leitzinger asked.

Hasina, 77, fled to neighbouring India at the culmination of the student-led uprising in August 2024, and has defied orders to return to Dhaka.
“She will serve the sentence the day she arrives in Bangladesh or surrenders to the court,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told reporters after the court decision.
The case centred around comments that prosecutors said she had made after she was ousted from power, which they said threatened witnesses in ongoing court hearings.
“The prosecution team believes her comment created an aura of fear among those who filed the cases and among the witnesses,” Islam said.
Shakil Akanda Bulbul, a fugitive leader of her now-banned Awami League, was sentenced to two months in prison in the same case.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August last year, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.
In a separate ongoing trial that began on June 1, prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.
Her state-appointed defence lawyer said she has denied the multiple charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.</p><small>2025-07-02 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02151521c8b1449.jpg?r=152710' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921634/trump-urges-60-day-gaza-ceasefire-deal-ahead-of-netanyahu-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Trump urges 60-day Gaza ceasefire deal ahead of Netanyahu visit</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump urged Hamas on Tuesday to accept a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, saying that Israel had agreed to finalise such a deal, as its forces also stepped up operations in the Palestinian territory.
Nearly 21 months of relentless Israeli bombardment have created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip, where Israel has recently expanded its military operations.
The civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people today.
Trump, in a post on social media, said his representatives had met with Israeli officials about the raging conflict, ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington next week.
“Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-day ceasefire, during which time we will work with all parties to end the war,” Trump wrote.
He said representatives of Qatar and Egypt, mediators in the conflict, would deliver “this final proposal”.
“I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this deal, because it will not get better — it will only get worse,” he warned.
 


Without directly mentioning Trump’s remarks, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said later that “a large majority within the government and the population is in favour of the plan to free the hostages”.
“If the opportunity arises, it must not be missed!” Saar wrote on X.
 


Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian fighters during Hamas’s 2023 attack that triggered the offensive, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 that the Israeli military says are dead.
Trump earlier on Tuesday said he would be “very firm” with Netanyahu when they meet on July 7.
The end of Israel’s 12-day war with Iran — which followed a US bombing mission on Tehran’s nuclear sites — has provided a window of opportunity for a deal, with Trump keen to add another peace agreement to a series of recent deals he has brokered.
Trump has complained he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in various conflicts, including the recent one between India and Pakistan.
Families lose multiple members as Israeli bombing continues
Trump campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.
 
 

However, Israel’s bombing of Gaza continues to rage on.
AFP footage from the area showed makeshift tent structures blown apart as Palestinians picked through the wreckage, trying to salvage what was left of their belongings.
One man held a pack of nappies, asking: “Is this a weapon?”
“They came here thinking it was a safe area and they were killed … What did they do?” said Maha Abu Rizq, whose uncle was killed in the strike.
AFP images from the nearby Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis city, showed medics treating young children covered in blood. Some appeared terrified while others lay still on hospital beds in bloodied bandages and clothes.

In southern Gaza, civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that five members of the same family were killed in an Israeli air strike today that hit a tent housing displaced people in the coastal Al-Mawasi area.
Despite being declared a safe zone by Israel in December 2023, Al-Mawasi has been hit by repeated Israeli strikes.
Further north, Bassal said that four people from the same family were killed in a pre-dawn Israeli air strike on a house in Gaza City, and another five in a drone strike on a house in the central Deir el-Balah area.
AFP photographers saw Israeli tanks deploying at the Gaza border in southern Israel and children picking through the rubble of a destroyed home in Gaza City.
Others photographed Palestinians mourning over the bodies of relatives in the city’s Al-Shifa hospital and the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it did not have enough information to comment on the specific reports, but insisted it was “operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities” in line with “international law, and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”.
In response to reports of deadly strikes in the north and south of the territory, the Israeli army told AFP it was “operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities”.
Separately, it said on Tuesday morning that in recent days it had “expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip”, claiming to have eliminated fighters and dismantled what it called “terror infrastructure sites”.
 


Raafat Halles, aged 39, from the Shujaiya district of Gaza City, said “air strikes and shelling have intensified over the past week” and tanks have been advancing.
“I believe that every time negotiations or a potential ceasefire are mentioned, the army escalates crimes and massacres on the ground,” he said. “I don’t know why.”
The Israeli military onslaught in response to the Hamas-led Oct 7, 2023 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures, has killed more than 56,600 people across Gaza.
The offensive has destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave, including the hospital system. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands missing under the rubble.
Netanyahu’s US visit
Netanyahu announced he would visit Trump and senior US security officials next week, amid mounting pressure to end the devastating fighting in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home.
Trump, while visiting a migrant detention centre in Florida, said Netanyahu “wants to end it too”.
Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP the group is “ready to agree to any proposal if it will lead to an end to the war and a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of occupation forces”.

The commission was set up in 2011 to trace missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible for their disappearance.
In the month of June alone, a total of 27 missing persons cases were received nationwide, while 33 cases were disposed of.
The commission offered a monthly breakdown of the cases received and disposed; 26 cases were received in January and 209 disposed of; 12 new cases in February and 104 disposed of; 30 were recieved in March and 34 disposed of; 11 were reported in April and 42 disposed of; 19 were received in May and 62 disposed of.
The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
A total of 4,771 missing persons have returned home, according to the report, while 1,017 people are being held in internment centres and 705 in prisons.
According to the report, the bodies of 293 missing persons have been recovered since the commission was formed in 2011.
Since then, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded the highest number of missing persons received at 3,622, followed by Balochistan at 2,885, Sindh at 1,847, Punjab at 1,752, Islamabad at 405, Azad Jammu and Kashmir at 71, and Gilgit-Baltistan at 10.

Followers of the Dalai Lama laud his tireless campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau in China about the size of South Africa.
It is a landmark decision for Tibetans, many of whom had feared a future without a leader, as well as for global supporters who see the Dalai Lama as a symbol of non-violence, compassion and the enduring struggle for Tibetan cultural identity under Chinese rule.
According to Tibetans, Tenzin Gyatso is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The charismatic Nobel Peace Prize-winning Buddhist had previously said the institution of Dalai Lama would continue only if there was popular demand.
He said on Wednesday he had received multiple appeals over the past 14 years from the Tibetan diaspora, Buddhists from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China, “earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama continue”.
“In particular, I have received messages through various channels from Tibetans in Tibet making the same appeal,” he said in a video broadcast at the start of a meeting of religious leaders in the Indian Himalayan town where he has lived for decades.
“In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he added, according to an official translation.
The announcement was made ahead of his 90th birthday on July 6.
‘Historic’
While China condemns him as a rebel and separatist, the internationally recognised Dalai Lama describes himself as a “simple Buddhist monk”.
Many exiled Tibetans fear China will name its own successor to bolster control over a territory it poured troops into in 1950.
But the Dalai Lama said that responsibility for identifying the 15th Dalai Lama “will rest exclusively” with the India-based Gaden Phodrang Trust, the office of the Dalai Lama.
Samdhong Rinpoche, a senior Tibetan leader from the Gaden Phodrang Trust, told reporters that the Dalai Lama was “in excellent health” and that, at this time, there were “no further instructions for succession”.
However, Rinpoche said the next Dalai Lama could be of “any nationality”, and would come from a place where there is “access to freedom”.
China said on Wednesday that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing, and that it would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters.
That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has already warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.
The Dalai Lama handed over political authority in 2011 to an exiled government chosen democratically by 130,000 Tibetans globally.
At the same time, he warned that the future of his spiritual post faced an “obvious risk of vested political interests misusing the reincarnation system”.
In 1995, Beijing selected a Panchen Lama, another influential Tibetan religious figure, and detained a Dalai Lama-recognised six-year-old, described by rights groups as the world’s youngest political prisoner.
The Dalai Lama’s announcement about the continuation of the role was welcomed with relief by Tibetans, including by Jigme Taydeh, a civil servant with the India-based Tibetan government.
“Whilst we rejoice at this confirmation of its continuation, we stringently object to China’s interference and plans to install a puppet Dalai Lama”, he said. “Neither the Tibetans nor the world would recognise such mischief. “</p><small>2025-07-02 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021406436118fa5.png?r=152947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921626/chinas-alibaba-launches-e-commerce-subsidies-of-7bn-in-consumption-boost' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Alibaba launches e-commerce subsidies of $7bn in consumption boost</strong></a><br><p>The online retail platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba announced on Wednesday that it will issue $7 billion in subsidies for certain purchases, providing a much-needed boost for a country struggling with sluggish spending.
Taobao, China’s e-commerce champion launched by Alibaba in 2003, said in a WeChat statement that the 50bn yuan ($6.97bn) would “directly subsidise consumers and merchants” over a 12-month period starting Wednesday.
The spending incentives on Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature will take the form of “red envelopes” — a digital form of traditional cash gifts — as well as discounts on products, deliveries and commissions, the statement said.
Taobao said that the subsidies will “provide consumers with preferential and convenient services and experiences, further stimulating consumption vitality”.
Beijing is battling to stave off deflationary pressure, which has threatened to dampen economic growth even as challenges elsewhere mount.
A lengthy property sector crisis and a fierce trade war with the United States this year have exacerbated concerns among Chinese households about making major purchases.
 
 

Chinese authorities have sought to allay fears, unleashing a series of aggressive policy measures aimed at boosting spending, including key interest rate cuts and various consumer goods trade-in schemes.
Results have been mixed, with retail sales in May growing at the fastest clip year-on-year since December 2023, according to official statistics, even as commercial property prices in a group of 70 key cities fell from April.
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged efforts to “advance the building of a unified national market” during a high-level meeting on economic policy, state news agency Xinhua said.
Leaders at the meeting also called for better management of “low-price disorderly competition” among companies.
“As China’s economy faces deflation pressures and a weak labour market, the government aims to address these challenges from the supply side,” Zhiwei Zhang, President and Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in response to Tuesday’s meeting.
“The top priority seems to be preventing over-competition,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02135838db26e41.jpg?r=135845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620/pakistan-and-india-likely-to-clash-on-sept-7-in-asia-cup-2025-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and India likely to clash on Sept 7 in Asia Cup 2025: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India are expected to play against each other “likely” on September 7 in the Asia Cup 2025 — set to begin on September 4 or 5 in the UAE, according to a report by The Times of India on Wednesday.
The T-20 tournament will mark the 17th edition of the Asia Cup, beginning with a group stage and then a super-four round. The participating teams include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the UAE.
According to Asia Cup’s website, recent political tensions between India and Pakistan have made UAE the frontrunner to host the tournament or serve as part of a hybrid hosting model. The multi-nation tournament was initially going to be hosted solely by India.
According to the Indian media report, a 17-day window has been almost finalised by the Asian Cricket Council, where India and Pakistan are to clash on September 7. The two teams could also see a second match on September 14, depending on how the teams progress.
The report said that all the participating teams are currently in the process of getting approvals from their respective governments, adding that promotional activities for the tournament are already underway.
The recent India-Pakistan tensions briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. The BCCI later termed the report as “speculative and imaginary”, according to the Press Trust of India.
India will host the women’s 50-overs World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.
Bilateral cricket has been suspended since 2013 between the Asian neighbours, who play each other only in multi-team events.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0212160042c747f.jpg?r=123052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921612/join-pakistans-anti-terror-efforts-bilawal-repeats-offer-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>Join Pakistan’s anti-terror efforts, Bilawal repeats offer to India</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday again extended an olive branch to India, asking the neighbouring country forge a partnership to pursue peace and jointly combat terrorism.
“Pakistan is ready to forge a historic, phenomenal partnership with India to jointly combat terror,” he said while addressing an international conference on ‘Pakistan Fighting War for the World against Terrorism’ at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute.
“Not as adversaries playing a zero sum game but as neighbours who share a moral and civilisational obligation to save a billion souls from the plague of extremism.
“All it requires is from India’s leadership is to step down from the high horse heading in the abyss and pursue peace with Pakistan.”
Bilawal also called on the Indian leadership to resolve all outstanding dispute including the Kashmir and the water crisis.
“Let us resolve Kashmir in accordance with the aspirations of the people. Let us end the weaponisation of water. And instead build peace as mighty as the Himalayas.
“Let us return to our shared traditions grounded not in hatred but the ancient soil of the Indus valley civilisation. It is not weakness to extend a hand. It is wisdom.”
The PPP chairman has been repeatedly calling for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.
Talking today, the former foreign minister said terrorism is a global crisis that need to be defeated for a sustainable future. He also highlighted the threat of “digital propaganda” in counter extremism.
“Pakistan is not drifting through the storm of terrorism. We are steering the vessel,” he said, adding that the country has rendered tremendous human and economic loss in this war on terror.
“We are still fighting because the alternate is surrender. And surrender is not a word in Pakistan’s dictionary,” he exclaimed.
 






He also highlighted the rise in militant violence over the past year, saying “2024 was the deadliest year in a decade in which 685 service members embraced martyrdom in 444 separate attacks”.
Bilawal also noted the efforts made by the armed forces and security personnel in combatting terrorism.
“Over the past two decades, Pakistan’s armed forces backed by iron willed citizens have broken the backs of Al Qaeda networks, dismantled so-called caliphates such as Daesh, and driven the TTP [Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan] from the fortress to the fox hills.”
“Operation Zarb-e-Azab drained the northern swamp, Raddul Fassad uprooted the sleeper cells in our cities and elsewhere. Today operations in Balochistan sever the connection between separatism and foreign funded terror.”
‘We saved Kabul’
The former foreign minister said Pakistan supported the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but instead faced a surge in cross-border terror attacks.
“Taliban regime was greeted as an inevitable fact. They promised the world stability, they delivered a 40 per cent surge in militant attacks on Pakistani soil, and a sanctuary for the TTP, BLA, Etim, and others.
“We saved Kabul. Sovereignty confers duty. Stop the exodus of fighters, choke the traffic of arms, and honour the blood price of the Doha accord or be judged by the company you keep.”
Bilawal said the world should learn lessons from Pakistan’s experience and achievements as the country requires development as an “antidote” against counter insurgency.
“We need equitable burden sharing. We asked for structured investment in counter terrorism and counter violent extremism, modern technology and weaponry,” he said. “No counter insurgency has achieved victory without first winning hearts and minds.”
He also delivered a message to the “merchant of hate” within the country, saying “there is no constitutional right to weaponise religion.”

“If the world demands we outlaw militias, it must also demand all that people live free from collective punishment.
“From the Kashmir valley to olive orchards of Palestine, the world must deliver a just peace.”
He said the world has changed drastically since India and Pakistan sat across the table in 2012.
“We have fought and won the most expensive counter terrorism campaign in modern history.  After our removal from FATF gray list, Pakistan stands among the most serious counter terrorism states.
“It is time India recognise this transformation, not as a concession but as an opportunity. Terrorism is a collective menace. No border fence, no nationalist rhetoric, no regional hegemony can shield one nation from a fire it may have help light on the other side.”
He stressed that terrorists have no nationality, religion, caste, or creed, and this menace respects no law. He called for collective global efforts to eliminate terrorism.</p><small>2025-07-02 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612037-hrcp-expresses-concern-over-shrinking-space-for-human-rights-work' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern over 'shrinking space' for human rights work</strong></a><br><p>

The April 22 attack in held Kashmir’s Pahalgam sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry as India blamed it on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
The US State Department issued a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the grouping, who met in Washington, but stopped short of naming Pakistan or blaming Islamabad.
“The Quad unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism,” the ministers said in the statement.
 
 

They called on all members of the United Nations to cooperate actively with “all relevant authorities” in delivering justice to the “perpetrators, organisers, and financiers of this reprehensible act”, without any delay.
India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s rising influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism efforts.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down six Indian jets after they bombed sites across the border that New Delhi alleged were “terrorist infrastructure”, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.
The ceasefire was first announced by US President Donald Trump on social media after Washington held talks with both sides, but India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
On Monday, India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, restated its position that trade was not a factor in the ceasefire.
“Relationships will never be free of issues,” he said, referring to the United States, adding, “What matters is the ability to deal with it and to keep that trend going in the positive direction.”
Last week, defence ministers attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting failed to adopt a joint communiqué as New Delhi refused to sign the statement over the exclusion of language referring to the Pahalgam attack.
The discord was a rare outcome for the 10-member Eurasian bloc that prides itself on consensus-based decision-making.</p><small>2025-07-02 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02114901722dedf.jpg?r=115037' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534/jaishankar-again-disputes-trumps-south-asia-ceasefire-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Jaishankar again disputes Trump’s ‘South Asia’ ceasefire claim</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, currently in Washington to participate in a Quad meeting, has again publicly challenged US President Donald Trump’s assertions that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, following a military escalation between the two nuclear armed neighbours in May this year.
In an interview with Newsweek, Jaishankar firmly denied Trump’s version of events, saying: “I can tell you that I was in the room when Vice President [JD] Vance spoke to Prime Minister Modi on the night of May 9.”
“There was no linking of trade and ceasefire,” he added.
Jaishankar recalled that Vance warned Modi that Pakistan was preparing for a large-scale attack.

Tells Newsweek he was ‘in the room’ when Vance spoke to Modi, claims trade was never discussed

“We did not accept certain things,” he said, noting that Modi remained unfazed and signalled that India would respond decisively.
The next morning, he claimed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed him that Pakistan was ready to talk. Later that day, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations, Major General Kashif Abdullah, directly contacted his Indian counterpart to request a ceasefire, the Indian minister asserted.
The remarks offer the first detailed Indian account of how the standoff ended — a version that contradicts Trump’s narrative. There was no official reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office until going to press.
The US president insists it was his personal intervention — via trade pressure and high-level calls — that prevented a nuclear conflict between the two South Asian neighbors.
India has publicly expressed frustration over what it sees as the Trump administration’s increasing tendency to insert itself into India-Pakistan affairs — particularly on the Kashmir issue. Trump’s repeated offers to “mediate” have drawn strong reactions in New Delhi, which has long rejected third-party involvement.
Trump has not only taken credit for defusing the May standoff but also praised Pakistan’s military leadership for its restraint — suggesting their cooperation made a peaceful resolution possible. While this framing may serve Washington’s broader diplomatic aims, it sits uneasily with New Delhi.
Islamabad, by contrast, has welcomed Trump’s acknowledgment of its role in easing the crisis. His remarks crediting an unnamed “quiet but decisive” Pakistani general are widely seen as referring to Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief.
The army chief’s Munir’s recent visit to Washington — which included a White House meeting — marked a significant breakthrough after years of limited military engagement.
Following the visit, Secretary Rubio made two phone calls to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, further fuelling speculation about US efforts to play a back-channel role in managing tensions in South Asia.
In remarks at a separate engagement, Jaishankar declared that India will not “yield to nuclear blackmail” while responding to alleged terrorist attacks, reaffirming New Delhi’s claim that the May 9 strikes inside Pakistan were retaliation for the Pahalgam incident.
Later, at a news briefing in Washington following a Quad meeting, Jaishankar appeared to hurl a veiled warning at Pakistan when he said: “The world must display zero tolerance [towards terrorism]. Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, and India has every right to defend its people against terrorism. And we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that.”

It is stated to be one of the mega irregularities reported so far in the accounts of the health authority, raising questions about the transparency in the public exchequer.
According to the audit report (a copy is also available with Dawn), there were 32 formations in the authority, and the audit was conducted of only 12 formations.
Total expenditure and revenue of the health authority were Rs5,070m and Rs5.8m, respectively, out of which 61pc expenditure and 65pc receipts were audited.

Auditor general exposes massive financial irregularities in scrutiny of 2022-24, raising questions about transparency

During an audit of the chief executive officer (CEO) of the authority for the financial year 2023-24, it was observed that it had purchased bulk medicines for Rs138.2m.
 
 

The probe revealed that minimum three prequalified bidders did not participate in the bidding process, and accordingly purchase order was issued in violation of clarification by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) and instructions issued by the Directorate General of Health Services Punjab. This resulted in irregular purchase of medicines worth Rs138.2m, and irregular purchase occurred due to weak financial controls, the report says.
In the audit of the financial years 2022-24, it was observed that the management had hired different batches of contingent paid staff for polio and dengue activities and paid Rs10.742m.
Scrutiny revealed that the management entered twice the same candidates with same names and CNICs in the same appointment orders/acquaintance rolls to draw double or triple salaries and embezzled the amount mentioned above. The matter was reported to the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) in Sep 2024, reads the report.
The management claimed salary discrepancies were due to typographical errors but failed to provide supporting records, making the reply unsatisfactory.
The Special Departmental Accounts Committee (SDAC), in its meeting on Nov 19, 2024 directed an administrative-level inquiry along with recovery of overpayment.
“No compliance was shown to the audit till finalization of the report in 2025 and the audit recommends recovery besides fixing responsibility against the person(s) at fault,” reads the audit report.
During an audit of 2022-24, it was observed that the amount of Rs192.7m was drawn from the treasury on account of the salary of contingent-paid staff.
Scrutiny revealed that Rs153.5m was paid and the remaining amount of Rs39.2m was misappropriated. Audit recommends recovery and fixing of responsibility. Under the same head,
The audit found that the management had withdrawn Rs451.4m on account of the salary of 6,552 contingent-paid staff hired for 152 days. However, as per attendance register out of 6,552 employees, 3,492 employees remained absent for 16,676 days but payment of Rs15.6m was paid for the absence period. The management misappropriated the overdrawn amount.
The audit found misappropriation of Rs58.5m due to the double hiring of contingent paid staff for the same period in different towns. The matter was reported to the PAO concerned in November 2024.
The management replied that the deputy district officers health were concerned only with the staff hired and paid for their towns only and the duplication with other towns was not known.
The reply was not tenable. The Special Departmental Accounts Committee, in its meeting on Nov 19, 2024, directed an inquiry at the administrative level to fix the responsibility. No compliance was shown to audit till finalization of the report.
During the audit of deputy district officer health (DDOH) Wahga Town for the financial years 2022-24, it was observed that Dr Hafiz Naveed, after transfer on Sept 26, 2022 and charge relinquishment on Sept 27, 2022, irregularly sanctioned Rs42.5m on Sept 28, 2022.
 
 

The audit report says that he opened an unauthorised bank account with the Bilal Ganj branch of a private bank without finance department’s approval, while maintaining the existing Baghbanpura account with a public bank.
A treasury cheque for Rs42.5m was deposited with the new account and subsequently withdrawn through two cheques of Rs20m and Rs 22.5m.
Moreover, the then DDO presented the bogus hiring orders as the details of CPS hired at Wagah Town and those entered in the bill submitted to the AG Office did not match. This resulted in fraudulent cash withdrawal of staff funds on fake orders of Rs42.5m.
Similarly, the audit report also pointed out irregularities, misappropriation and embezzlement of other funds in the account of the health authority. Some of them included, Rs47.6m against unauthorised engagement of additional staff, Rs487m against non-transparent hiring of the employees, Rs45.8m against overpayment of pay and allowances, etc.

The US Department of Education said in a statement that UPenn had entered into a resolution agreement vowing to comply with Title IX, the federal law which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any educational program.
It follows an investigation by the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which found the university had violated Title IX by allowing transgender swimmer Thomas to compete in women’s competitions in 2021-2022.
US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on the issue of trans athletes, has worked to prohibit them from competing in girls’ and women’s sports since returning to office.
Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at banning transgender athletes, allowing federal agencies to halt funding to any institution that does not consider birth-assigned genders in determining sex.
US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement on Tuesday that the resolution of the UPenn case marked a “great victory for women and girls … across our nation”.
 






“The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX’s proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law.”
Under the terms of the settlement, UPenn will restore all individual swimming records and titles to female athletes affected by Thomas’s participation.
The university will also send a “personalised letter of apology” to each swimmer impacted by the case.
The college will also be required to issue a public statement specifying it will “not allow males to compete in female athletic programmes” or use Penn Athletics facilities for women, such as locker rooms.
Thomas became a lightning rod around the debate of transgender athletes in women’s sports after competing in female collegiate competitions in 2022.
She had earlier swum on UPenn’s men’s team while undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
Her participation in women’s events sparked widespread outrage, with critics and some fellow swimmers saying she should not have been allowed to compete due to an unfair physiological advantage. Her supporters argued she should be allowed to compete as a woman.
One of Thomas’s competitors, Riley Gaines, welcomed Tuesday’s announcement.
 






Gaines has been a long-time critic of Thomas’s participation in women’s collegiate swimming, and tied for fifth place with her in the 200-yard freestyle at a national collegiate meeting in 2022.
“It is my hope that today demonstrates to educational institutions that they will no longer be allowed to trample upon women’s civil rights, and renews hope in every female athlete that their country’s highest leadership will not relent until they have the dignity, safety, and fairness they deserve,” Gaines said in a statement.</p><small>2025-07-02 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612004-pti-rift-widens-as-junaid-akbar-cm-gandapur-camps-trade-blame' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rift widens as Junaid Akbar, CM Gandapur camps trade blame</strong></a><br><p>

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Erad­ication at the National Ins­titute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the latest polio case from District North Waziristan in southern KP.
“A 19-month-old boy from Union Council Mir­an­shah-3, District North Waziristan, has been confirmed as the eighth polio case from KP this year. With this latest detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 14 — including eight from KP, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” an official from the laboratory said.
“Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under the age of five during each campaign, along with timely completion of all essential immunisations,” he said.
“While nationwide efforts to eradicate polio continue to improve the quality of vaccination campaigns, the southern districts of KP remain a major concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination. These obstacles result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,” the official said.
“A special vaccination activity was conducted in six union councils of Bannu from June 23 to 28, during which 17,485 children received the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). A similar targeted vaccination drive is being planned in 11 union councils of North Waziristan.
“Additionally, preparations are underway for a large-scale special vaccination campaign in southern KP, scheduled for August,” he further said.
“Recent polio cases in sou­thern KP are a stark reminder that children missed during vaccination campaigns rem­ain at serious risk. While the programme is making every effort to reach every child, the role of parents is critical. Ensuring every child receives every dose of the polio vaccine is not just important — it’s urgent,” he emphasised.

“The name of the institution remains ‘Jinnah Institute of Cardiology, Lahore’ and no change is under consideration. In the Punjab government’s annual development programme for the fiscal year 2025-26, funding has been allocated under the name Jinnah Institute of Cardiology,” Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a post on ‘X’ on Tuesday.
 






“As part of the efforts to provide world-class treatment for cardiac and other diseases, 14 new hospitals will be established in the Nawaz Sharif Medical District. The master plan for this project is near completion,” Ms Aurangzeb said and asked journalists to “verify the facts” before publishing any news.
The controversy stemmed from the speech of the chief minister in the Punjab Assembly and a subsequent statement by Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique.
The minister had said the Jinnah Institute of Cardiology Lahore has been renamed as ‘Maryam Nawaz Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases’.
The chief minister said on the floor of the House on Saturday last that she has decided to set up an extension of the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) as both the population and heart diseases had increased in the province.
“The Maryam Nawaz Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases will be an extension of the PIC. It is in the final stage of completion,” she said and also showed the pictures of the project site in the assembly.
Following this decision, the provincial government as well as the chief minister faced backlash on social media as even ‘pro-PML-N’ analysts and journalists started questioning the logic behind this move.
PTI senior leader and former federal minister Moonis Elahi said on X: “This is too much. The institute which was established in the name of the father of the nation has been renamed after Maryam Nawaz. This is outrageous.”
 






PPP Punjab leader Faisal Mir said: “When small people reach big positions by accident or other means, this is what exactly happens. The name of the father of the nation is being erased so that a sitting chief minister can plaster her own name there.
Former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said: “That’s the way to go. Jinnah who? If self-entitlement and being deaf to public opinion had another name.”
 






Journalist Mona Alam said: “Sorry Maryam Nawaz sahiba, but Jinnah’s name is the red line for every Pakistani.”
Khwaja Salman Rafique on Tuesday also clarified that in the official documents, there has been no change in the name of the cardiac facility in question.

Justice Jawad Hassan of LHC, Rawalpindi Bench, issued the order on Tuesday and set a three-month deadline for the mediation process.
The dispute is over 250 kanals of land acquired by the military in the early 1980s in Shamsabad, Rawalpindi, for defence purposes. Later, the land’s status was changed to commercial and Panorama Shopping Centre was built over it.
During the proceedings on Tuesday, petitioners’ lawyer, Sardar Muhammad Ghazi, informed the court that the clients filed the case under Article 199 of the Constitution. They had sought an amicable settlement of disputes related to their acquired land, particularly the issue of fair market compensation.
He highlighted that the prolonged litigation has distressed the landowners, who were now inclined to settle the matter outside court through mediation.
 
 

The military authorities, through a letter dated June 24, had already expressed their willingness to settle the dispute out of court. He noted that one of the landowners, Chaudhary Riaz Ahmed, had already shown willingness to settle the matter out of court and had written to the Army Air Defence Command, Rawalpindi, in this regard.
The authorities, in response to the letter, said, “…the request has been considered at appropriate level and [Headquarters Command] has agreed to resolve the matter of price/compensation through out of court settlement, subject to withdrawal of all writ petitions related to Ohjri Camp land”.
During the proceedings on Tuesday, Advocate Ghazi cited Supreme Court judgments, including Messrs Mughals Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd vs EOBI (PLD 2025 SC 1) and Muhammad Naseer Butt vs Additional District Judge, Lahore, to emphasise the constitutional and statutory backing for mediation under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017.
Justice Hassan, while disposing of the matter, acknowledged the petitioners’ decision and directed the relevant authorities to expedite the mediation process.
He ordered that meetings for dispute resolution should be held at a time and place suited to the respondents. The entire exercise must be completed strictly in accordance with the law in three months, the judge ordered.
In 2012, the LHC had directed the Ministry of Defence to either vacate the land or compensate the owners. However, the decision was not implemented.

This marks the lowest inflation rate since FY16, when it stood at 2.9pc — a nine-year low.
Pakistan is currently experiencing disinflation, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), average cumulative inflation over the past 53 months has risen by 83pc, significantly affecting retail prices of consumer goods. Despite the recent decline in inflation, the cost of living remains elevated.
The State Bank of Pakistan has revised its inflation target for FY25 to a range of 5-7pc, down from the government’s initial projection of 12pc. The International Mon­etary Fund has also lowered its inflation forecast for the same period to 9.5pc, compared to its earlier estimate of 12.7pc. For FY26, the government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc.
The inflation rate in June recorded a growth of 3.2pc, slightly eased from 3.5pc recorded in May. This decline was mainly contributed by a slight decrease in the prices of food items during the month under review.
 
 

The headline inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by 0.2pc in June on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the PBS on Tuesday.
The annual inflation, however, fell short of the projected targets. Analysts attributed the decline to lower global commodity prices, stable exchange rates, higher base effect and better agricultural outputs.
Over the past 12 months, the average monthly inflation has shown fluctuations.
The inflation rate in June 2025 was the lowest mainly due to the high base effect from the previous year (June 2024 — 12.6pc).
The CPI inflation dropped to 9.6pc in August 2024, marking the first single-digit figure in over three years, and the downward trend continued in the following months.
Food inflation for June recorded a positive growth of 4.2pc in urban areas and 2.4pc in rural areas, whereas non-food inflation was 2.2pc in urban areas and 4.7pc in rural areas.
The food prices rebounded to a positive trend after a decline in four consecutive months.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was recorded at 6.9pc in urban areas and 8.6pc in rural areas in May.
In urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the month-on-month increase in June included tomatoes (57.33pc), potatoes (25.74pc), onions (15.26pc), eggs (8.82pc), gur (2.75pc), rice (1.67pc), wheat flour (1.53pc), sugar (1.52pc), fresh fruits (1.38pc), milk powder (0.78pc), milk fresh (0.40pc) and milk products (0.35pc).

• Industrialists demand end to peak, off-peak charges; decry denial of promised ‘sizeable relief’
• No change in rates for first two slabs of domestic consumers; relief ranges between 3pc and 10pc depending on usage
ISLAMABAD: As the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) decided on Tuesday to reduce the national average power tariff by Rs1.14 per unit, the move was criticised by industrialists and businesspersons from Karachi as being “too minuscule”.
The decision to reduce the tariff was taken at a public hearing presided over by Nepra members Maqsood Anwar and Rafique Shaikh.
The government team, led by the Power Division additional secretary, Mehfooz Bhatti, said the regulator had determined national average tariff — excluding all taxes, surcharges and duties — at Rs34 for FY2025-26, down Rs1.50 per unit from Rs35.50 per unit last year.
 
 

After subsidies and cross-subsidies, the government has worked out the tariff to be Rs31.59 per unit, as compared to Rs32.73 per unit last year, a reduction of Re1.14 per unit.
The official said the same rate would apply to K-Electric consumers under the government’s uniform tariff policy.
A formal notification of the new tariffs will be issued within this week. The new rates will take effect from July 1.
Rushed process
Karachi-based representatives of the FPCCI, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry and Surjani Town businesses criticised the government and the Nepra for rushing through the approval process and not allowing their requests for time to understand and review the government’s petition.
They said the Power Division filed the petition on June 28. It was approved a day later by the federal cabinet and made public on June 30 for a hearing on July 1.
They said the process violated the law that provided at least seven days after the publication of petition to hold a public hearing.
Peak, off-peak billing
The industrialists criticised the government for a nominal reduction of Rs1.14 per unit in the tariff after promising “sizeable relief”.
“Even after the reduction of Rs1.14 per unit, the effective tariff would be about Rs5 per unit higher than last year when the industry paid on average Rs30 per unit”, said one of the businessperson.
 
 

The government team insisted the effective average tariff during the new fiscal year would be around Rs40.43 against Rs47.89 per unit in FY2025 after taking into account all taxes, surcharges, duties and quarterly adjustments and the removal of PTV fee and electricity duty.
They said the government efforts, coupled with improved exchange rate, helped reduce capacity payments by Rs1.27 per unit on average from 30.88 to Rs29.61 per unit when compared to the outgoing year.
The average transmission and distribution losses of Discos, they claimed, had dropped to 11.03pc from 11.43pc.
Industrial consumers also demanded an end to peak and off-peak rates, enabling the industry to operate round-the-clock instead of shutting down during peak hours due to higher rates.
New tariff
The Rs1.15 per unit reduction in tariff would apply to consumers in almost all categories, except lifeline domestic consumers.
There would be no change in electricity rates for first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they are already over-subsidised.
The per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in 50 to 100 unit monthly consumption. They have to maintain their consumption threshold throughout the year.
For all other consumers and categories, the government sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26.
However, the relief ranges between 3 to 10pc depending on the users’ respective rates at present.
The protected consumers in 1 to 100 units would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, showing a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers in first 100 units would be charged at Rs23.44 per unit instead of Rs23.59 per unit, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would  vary from three to four percent but flat Rs1.15 per unit. The cheapest rate, in these categories, have been provided to the industry whose average rate would now be Rs33.48 per unit instead of Rs44.32 per unit.
Commercial consumers would be provided electricity at an average Rs45.43 per unit instead of Rs46.58 per unit. The average rate of general services would be Rs43.17 per unit instead of Rs44.32 while tariff for bulk consumers would come down to Rs41.76 per unit from Rs42.92 per unit.
However, agricultural consumers would get an even cheaper rate of Rs30.75 per unit instead of Rs31.90. The average rate would work out to be around Rs31.60 per unit from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.

Designed to measure greenhouse gas emissions with “unprecedented resolution”, the MethaneSAT space probe was also funded by Wellington and the US-based Environmental Defence Fund.
Plagued with technical problems, the satellite recently stopped responding to its Earth-bound controllers.
“Clearly, this is a disappointing development,” said Andrew Johnson, a senior official at the New Zealand Space Agency.
“As those who work in the space sector know, space is inherently challenging, and every attempt — successful or not — pushes the boundaries of what we know and what we’re capable of.”
The Environmental Defence Fund, which led the project, said it was “difficult news” but would not be the end of its methane-tracking efforts.
MethaneSAT was designed to measure emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, which fuels climate change by trapping heat in the planet’s atmosphere.
 
 

It has proven notoriously difficult to get accurate estimates of the methane emissions belched out by oil and gas projects around the globe.
“It was one of the most advanced methane tracking satellites in space, measuring methane emissions in oil and gas producing regions across the world,” the MethaneSAT team said.
‘Remarkable’
Project lead Steven Hamburg said initial data gleaned by the satellite was “remarkable”.
“Recent measurements in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico revealed emissions three to five times higher than estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, while emissions observed in the South Caspian region are over 10 times higher than reported,” Hamburg wrote on LinkedIn.
MethaneSAT was launched into space in March 2024 on the back of a SpaceX rocket fired from California.
Controllers first lost contact with the satellite on June 20, the MethaneSAT team said in a statement.
They confirmed it had lost all power on Monday this week and was “likely not recoverable”.
“The engineering team is conducting a thorough investigation into the loss of communication,” MethaneSAT said. “This is expected to take time. We will share what we learn.”
Despite its shorter-than-expected lifespan, MethaneSAT hailed the mission as a “remarkable success in terms of scientific and technological accomplishment”.
The satellite eventually succumbed after overcoming a string of technical glitches.
It repeatedly entered a sleep, or stand-by, mode without prompting — forcing engineers to perform a lengthy reset each time.
One of its three thrusters also failed.</p><small>2025-07-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02112746783b8fc.jpg?r=112751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921574/justice-dogar-formally-picked-to-head-capital-court' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Dogar formally picked to head capital court</strong></a><br><p> 

(LEFT to right) IHC CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, PHC CJ S. M. Attique Shah, BHC CJ Rozi Khan Barrech and SHC CJ Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.

• Receives nine votes from 16-member JCP; set to take oath in a couple of days
• Justice Rozi Barrech named BHC CJ, Justice Attique Shah becomes top judge at PHC, Justice Junaid Ghaffar appointed to head SHC
• Justice Mansoor suggests postponing JCP meeting until decision on IHC judges’ appeal
• Justice Mandokhail abstains from voting, citing his position on Constitutional Bench
ISLAMABAD: The five Islamabad High Court judges who had petitioned the Supreme Court over a seniority dispute were left with no recourse on Tuesday, as the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — in a highly-anticipated move — nominated Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the high court.
The appointment of Justice Sarfraz Dogar as the new IHC chief justice was expected after President Asif Ali Zardari formally declared him the “senior-most judge” last week, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law.
Justice Dogar was transferred to the IHC from the Lahore High Court under Article 200(1) of the Constitution on Feb 1 this year.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the 16-member JCP held four different meetings, also concerning the appointments of chief justices for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Peshawar High Court (PHC), Sindh High Court (SHC).
But the appointment of the IHC CJ was peculiar, since it had evoked much interest among the legal fraternity in view of the representation by five IHC judges, and a constitutional petition filed before the Supreme Court.
For the IHC, the JCP had three nominees under consideration: Justice Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. Justice Dogar received a total of nine votes, while Justice Aurangzeb was supported by the CJP, PTI members Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as Islamabad High Court Council member Zulfikar Abbas.
Justice Mohsin Kayani received the votes of SC’s senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail did not vote for any nominee, stating that since he was a member of the Const­itutional Bench, he preferred to abstain.
Justice Dogar, however, secured the support of the remaining members: Justice Aminuddin Khan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Ahsan Bhoon, Sheikh Aftab Ahmed, Rana Tanveer, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui and Roshan Khursheed Bharucha.
He is now expected to take oath in the next couple of days at the Presidency, as the JCP has already informed the principal secretary to the prime minister about his elevation.
As Tuesday’s session commenced, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who was connected via weblink from Tokyo (Japan), suggested postponing the meeting until the pendency of the intra-court appeal (ICA) filed on behalf of the five IHC judges against the Constitutional Bench’s June 19 judgement in the seniority dispute.
In its short order, the CB, by a majority of three to two, had held that the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts was within the framework of the Constitution.
Subsequently, discussion ensued on the suggestion, with some members stating that since the seniority dispute had already been resolved, the JCP should proceed with the appointment process for the IHC.
Meanwhile, some members suggested that the JCP, as a constitutional body, could decide to put on hold the appointment of Justice Dogar as chief justice. Others were of the view that until the ICA was finally decided, Justice Aurangzeb should be elevated as the acting chief justice of the IHC.
When the JCP commenced its proceedings, Justice Shah reiterated his earlier stance that the commission should wait until the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment were decided by the Constitutional Bench before addressing matters that directly flow from it.
Justice Shah also wrote a fresh letter to the JCP to highlight his point.
Earlier, the JCP also considered a letter from Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail of the Balochistan High Court, who drew the commission’s attention to the fact that the participation of retired Justice Nazir Ahmad Lango as its member would violate the mandate of Article 175A(5) of the Constitution.
However, the commission, by majority, reappointed Justice Lango as a member of the commission and, in turn, nominated Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice of the BHC. The names of Justice Mulakhail and Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kazi were also under consideration for the same post.
Justice S.M. Attique Shah was nominated as the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court. The names of Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Arshad Ali were also considered. PTI lawmakers and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa law minister opposed Justice Attique’s appointment.
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar was unanimously appointed chief justice of the Sindh High Court.

Federal tax collection in Karachi rose by 29 per cent year-on-year, while the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) recorded a 29.5pc increase in sales tax on services. The city retained its status as the largest contributor to national and provincial revenue.
The SRB collects General Sales Tax (GST) on services, while five offices of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) — RTO-1, RTO-2, Medium Tax­payers Office (MTO), Corporate Tax Office (CTO), and Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) — handle income tax, sales tax on goods, and Federal Excise Duty (FED) within Karachi.
 
 

According to estimates, 80pc of SRB’s GST collection originates from Karachi, with the remaining 20pc from interior Sindh. However, even when operations are based outside the city, taxes are still collected at the company headquarters in Karachi.

LTO and SRB report historic highs in income tax and GST on services in FY25

LTO Karachi performance
The Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) Karachi collected Rs3.256 trillion in FY25, up from Rs2.515tr in the previous year — an increase of 29.46pc.
The LTO Karachi also collected record Rs184.7bn in one day with overall collection of Rs449.05bn in June, registering a growth of 48pc year on year.  The LTO chief commissioner attributed this performance to a committed and professional team.
Income tax collection reached Rs1.798tr in the outgoing fiscal year, up 32pc from Rs1.360tr a year ago.
Sales tax grew by 21pc to Rs1.235tr from Rs1.018tr, while FED rose sharply by 63pc to Rs222.2bn from Rs136.3bn.
The figures do not include taxes collected via port operations, further underscoring Karachi’s economic importance.
 
 

SRB collection
The Sindh Revenue Board collected Rs306.6bn in the fiscal year 2024-25, up from Rs236.8bn in FY24. Despite low inflation and modest economic growth, the provincial tax authority maintained double-digit growth. In June alone, SRB collected Rs40.5bn — its highest-ever monthly total — up 44pc from Rs28.1bn in June FY24 and 3pc higher than May FY25.
SRB Chairman Dr Wasif Ali Memon credited the surge to the dedication of the SRB workforce, political backing from the Sindh government, and cooperation from taxpayers.
He noted that SRB is preparing to meet new challenges in FY26, including the collection of Agricultural Income Tax (AIT) and implementation of a Negative List Tariff regime for sales tax on services, set to begin on July 1, 2025.

• Links counterterrorism to resolving root causes of conflicts
• Dar to chair three key UNSC sessions, including debate on Palestine
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has urged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in war-ravaged Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and exact a devastating toll on infrastructure.
“The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza defies comprehension,” said Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, during a briefing to the 15-member Council on the Middle East situation.
The Israeli military has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians — mostly women and children — since Oct 7, 2023.
The briefing came as Pakistan assumed presidency of the Security Council for July 2025, marking a significant moment in its multilateral diplomacy.
The briefing was held in line with Security Council’s Resol­ution 2334 (2016), which requires the UN Secretary-General to report on its implementation every three months. The resolution demands that Israel cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
However, the discussion also covered the risk of famine in Gaza and a new aid mechanism conducted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a non-UN entity backed by Israel and the United States.
In sharply worded remarks, the Pakistani envoy said the new aid distribution mechanism is not only contrary to international humanitarian law and human dignity, but it also places starving civilians in direct danger, forcing them to cross active combat zones in search of food and water.
“The result is a grotesque cycle of horror: over 500 people have been killed while trying to access humanitarian aid,” Ambassador Ahmad said. “This is a death trap.”
He added, “The failure to enforce the Council’s own decisions carries grave consequences for global peace and security and undermines the Council’s own authority and credibility.”
At the outset, UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari warned that the level of suffering and brutality in Gaza was unbearable, calling the continued collective punishment of Palestinians unjustifiable.
‘Deep sense of purpose’
Meanwhile, as Pakistan has assumed the UNSC presidency for the current month, the Foreign Office said in a statement that the country “undertakes this responsibility with a deep sense of purpose, humility and conviction. Our approach will continue to remain anchored in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect for international law, and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism”.
As a country that has consistently advocated for dialogue and diplomacy, Pakistan brings to the Security Council an objective, principled, and balanced perspective shaped by its foreign policy, past experience at the Council, and its long-standing contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security, including through UN peacekeeping and peace-building efforts, it said.
The presidency will convene two high-level signature events during this month: an open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”, to be held on July 22; and a briefing on “Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional and Sub-Regional Organisations: The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)”, scheduled for July 24.
Both meetings will be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who will also preside over the quarterly open debate on the Question of Palestine on 23 July 2025. Mr Dar will also preside over the quarterly open debate on Palestine.
“Pakistan looks forward to working closely with all Council members to promote timely and united action, in line with the Council’s Charter responsibilities and the expectations of the international community,” the Foreign Office said.
Mr Dar said Pakistan takes on this responsibility with humility, conviction, and a profound commitment to the UN Charter.
“Our presidency comes at a time of escalating conflicts and humanitarian crises across the world. We will strive to steer the Security Council towards responsive and effective action grounded in dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution”, he said on a post on X.
In a separate address on the future of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture, Ambassador Ahmad called for addressing the root causes of terrorism — particularly unresolved conflicts, foreign occupation and systemic injustice.
“The UN’s counterterrorism discourse must not only address the response factors but also the underlying and preventive factors,” he said.

The announcement was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Af­­fairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday. Senior ministry officials also attended the session.

To launch ferry service connecting Pakistan with GCC countries

“The initiative is part of the government’s strategy to enhance regional connectivity, boost maritime trade and position Gwadar as a major hub in the Arabian Sea,” Mr Chaudhry said. “We aim to transform Gwadar into a strategic transhipment and logistics centre, benefiting Pakistan and the wider region.”
He emphasised that with Gwadar Port now fully ope­rational, it is time to accelerate its integration into international maritime networks. He directed relevant dep­artments to pursue all necessary steps to increase the port’s commercial activity and unlock its full potential.
 
 

He said additional shipping lines will be connected to Gwadar to facilitate greater movement of goods, promote transit trade with Central Asia and the Middle East, and support Pakistan’s growing role in the regional logistics landscape.
“The new routes will reduce pressure on existing ports and ensure faster, more efficient cargo handling,” Mr Chaudhry stated.
In addition to enhancing cargo operations, the maritime ministry has also planned to launch a ferry service from Gwadar to GCC countries. The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
“The ferry service will strengthen people-to-people ties, boost tourism and provide a new economic lifeline for Balochistan,” the minister said. “It will create local employment, improve supporting infrastructure and attract private sector participation, especially in the areas of ship services, hospitality and transportation.”

The outage had resulted in a significant shortfall of over 360 million gallons of water during the past four days, exacerbating the city’s existing water crisis.
Though the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) started pumping water from the Dhabeji pumping station after the restoration of electricity, the crisis will persist for at least another day as it takes over 18 hours to fully charge the main pipelines of the distribution network.
According to a KWSC spokesman, the power was restored in the morning and the water supply to the city had resumed as usual. Due to the power outage, the city faced a shortage of 360 million gallons of water, he added.
The power breakdown at the pumping station had occurred on June 26 at 10 pm.
