The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was cut to 11pc in May. The bank had kept the rate unchanged on June 16 as well.
The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) had claimed that both interest and exchange rates were being kept artificially high without economic justification, and appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure a correction to support growth and stability.
The PBF also criticised the current interest rate of 11pc, calling it unjustifiable given that the Consumer Price Index-based inflation had dropped to 4pc. It urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to reduce the policy rate to at least 9pc in its upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for July 30.

Pakistan joined the United Nations shortly after gaining independence in 1947 and has played a prominent role in peacekeeping efforts, contributing to 48 missions in 29 countries since 1960.
Islamabad has repeatedly called for enhancements in UN peacekeeping, with Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad in April urging the integration of the use of advanced technologies to boost effectiveness.
Ambassador Ahmad, while addressing the 15-member UN Security Council on Tuesday, said: “Nowhere is this more urgently needed than in Jammu and Kashmir, a longstanding dispute on the UN Security Council’s agenda.
 






“This Council, which mandates the missions, must ensure that missions are deployed with an accompanying credible political process that addresses the root causes of conflicts, and that mission mandates are demand-driven, clear, sequenced, and context-specific.”
The Pakistan envoy was speaking at a debate titled ‘Adapting Peace Operations for the Pursuit of Political Solutions’.
“This council should fulfil its obligations and make concerted efforts to secure a just and lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he added.
In his remarks, Ambassador Iftikhar highlighted Pakistan’s experience of nearly eight decades of engagement with UN Peace operations, saying the country had remained among the top troop contributors, host to one of the UNs oldest missions United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan, which monitors the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region.
“We are also a founding member of the Peacebuilding Commission,” he said, pointing out that over 235,000 Pakistani peacekeepers have served with distinction in missions across four continents.
“A total of 182 of our bravest have laid down their lives in the service of peace. We greatly value the importance of the UN peace operations”.
In May, the UN honoured 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers from 32 countries, including two from Pakistan, who died serving in missions last year, at a ceremony marking the annual ‘International Day of UN Peacekeepers’. Two of them were honoured posthumously.
“Overall, peace operations are a success story,” said Ahmad, who is the UNSC President for July.
“With an annual budget of $5.5 billion, UN peacekeeping worldwide constitutes less than 0.3 per cent of global military spending.”
He pointed out that multiple studies have confirmed that peacekeeping reduces violence, protects civilians and helps sustain peace arrangements.
“All reform efforts must therefore preserve operational credibility, institutional memory and readiness of peace operations,” he said. “Peacekeeping is not a silver bullet, but neither is it obsolete.”
 






The Pakistani envoy said the success of peace operations depends on a strong political undertaking by member states, particularly the Security Council.
“Where the UN and the council retreat or hesitate, political vacuums emerge,” he said, noting that this vacuum is being increasingly filled by negative actors and soldiers of fortune, thus proliferating the threats to international peace and security.
“That space must be reclaimed through credible political processes, anchored by the Council’s authority and implemented through empowered UN missions.”
He urged that peacekeeping missions should put greater emphasis on promoting local peace arrangements at the community level wherever possible to reduce violence and build trust.
In April this year, while speaking at a UN peacekeeping meeting, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar proposed a comprehensive reform of UN peacekeeping operations, urging the international community to adapt peacekeeping structures and strategies to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing global security landscape.
Also in April, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding support for UN peace operations while speaking to UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who called on him at the interior ministry.</p><small>2025-07-30 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3013242334b52b0.png?r=140902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600/kp-seeks-confidence-over-bajaur-military-operation-vows-to-lift-curfew' target='_blank'><strong>KP seeks confidence over Bajaur military operation, vows to lift curfew</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has opposed the newly launched military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift a three-day curfew imposed in the district’s 16 areas yesterday.
Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in the Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. Tribal elders in Bajaur and some other KP districts have long opposed any military operation, citing concerns over displacement.
Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.
Chairing a PTI parliamentary party meeting in Peshawar late last night, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said: “We are not in favour of any military operation without the provincial government being taken into confidence.”
 
 

He lamented that the “relationship of confidence between our army and our public” was eroding due to the “martyred civilians and collateral damage in Bajaur”, adding that the lack of trust was failing the country’s fight against terrorism.
The meeting vowed that the recent curfew in parts of Bajaur would be revoked today. However, an official announcement for that is yet to be made.
It was decided that further course of action regarding an operation would be announced after the matter was debated in the KP Assembly.
“We are standing with our public. We will go to every extent for our public,” CM Gandapur vowed. “We cannot ruin our soil for those decisions that are imposed on us without our consultation.”
The meeting made several decisions regarding the ongoing security situation and its future actions to address the concerns raised by the people.
CM Gandapur ordered all deputy commissioners not to impose any curfew without permission from the KP home department, regardless of “any kind of situation”. He also decided to transfer the powers of imposing Section 144, under which a curfew is put in place, to the department.
 


The PTI meeting further decided to revoke the KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance 2019, with legislation for that expected to be introduced in Friday’s KP Assembly session.
The ordinance provided legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations — similar to two 2011 regulations imposed in the tribal areas.
The gathering also approved the decisions taken at a multi-party conference (MPC) held last week, wherein Gandapur opposed a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region and vowed to take action against all armed outfits.
Further, the KP CM said he would meet with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir to discuss the province’s law and order situation.
Speaking on a series of jirgas planned in the upcoming week, the chief minister said: “In the next 10 days, we will hold multiple jirgas, each of two districts, after which a grand jirga of all stakeholders in terrorism-ridden areas will be convened.
“In view of the decisions made in the jirgas, policies will be re-evaluated,” he said, adding that the government will convey the reassessment to “those responsible for protecting the borders”.
The KP CM claimed that soldiers who sacrificed their lives were “not rewarded properly due to wrong policies”. “We have repeatedly said to review these policies.”
Protesters gather in Bajaur: PTI MPA
Meanwhile, PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan said protesters were gathering at Bajaur’s Umary Chowk to demonstrate against the “unannounced operation”.
Pictures shared by him of the purported protest showed hundreds of men gathered on a street.
The gathering follows yesterday’s protest by residents of War Mamund tehsil against the operation, where they demanded that authorities ensure the safety of civilians during the operation.
Besides Zeb, MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman and Mohammad Nisar Khan; former MNA Gul Zafar Khan; and MNA Mubarakzeb Khan, the prime minister’s special assistant on tribal districts, have condemned the operation and the curfew in the area.
Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the operation’s launch and urged authorities to stop it immediately.
 






The Awami National Party also condemned the military action, with party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain questioning its legality. They noted that according to Article 245 of the Constitution, approval of the provincial government was required for military operations.
 






Compensation for slain ‘civilians, soldiers’ in operation
The chief minister also presided over a separate meeting to review the law and order situation in the wake of the Bajaur operation.
CM Gandapur was briefed on the situation by the relevant officials, according to a statement from his office. Expressing his condolences to the bereaved families of “civilians and security personnel martyred in the Bajaur incident”, he announced compensation worth Rs10 million for them.
Compensation of Rs2.5m was also announced for those injured during the “incident”.
The KP chief secretary and Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed were among various officials present during the meeting.
 






The reported incident comes just days after seven protesters were shot dead and 16 others were injured in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to sources and protesters, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.
Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government also announced separate Rs10m for each deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p><small>2025-07-30 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3013383708bc2da.png?r=135704' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927592/rescue-1122-saves-160-tourists-stranded-due-to-flash-floods-in-kps-naran-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Rescue 1122 saves 160 tourists stranded due to flash floods in KP’s Naran: spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams evacuated 160 stranded tourists from Naran in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mansehra district after flash floods, triggered by heavy rainfall, swept through parts of the region on Wednesday, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September, are crucial to the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
This year’s monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.
Mansehra’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Amir Khadam Khan, told Dawn.com that 160 tourists were stranded after floods hit Naran, Jalkhad, Barwai and Besar.
“Rescue 1122 personnel crossed the flood drain on foot near Besar to access more than 160 stranded tourists and vehicles,” he said. “All the people were safely evacuated and accommodated in nearby hotels.”
He added that the Naran Road was also blocked in multiple locations. However, after “tireless” efforts of 12 consecutive hours, it was cleared for all traffic by the National Highway Authority, with the support of the police and the Kaghan Development Authority.
The spokesperson said that the rescue operation still continued in the area, and the stranded tourists’ vehicles were also successfully recovered.
He added that during the operation, Rescue 1122 provided first aid to seven or eight people with minor injuries, severe body pain, hypoglycemia, vomiting and other ailments. Fresh water was also provided to the tourists.
“Fortunately, no serious casualties were reported,” Khadam said.
Meanwhile, flash floods triggered by heavy rain caused the deaths of two children due to a house collapse in the Hazara Division in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The Abbottabad police spokesperson, Azam Khan, told Dawn.com that two children were killed after a house collapsed in Bakot, Abbottabad, on Tuesday night.
“The bodies were recovered by locals, adding that the girls were between two and three years old,” he said.
Last week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.
However, at the same time, the national death toll from monsoon-related casualties surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 — nearly half of the total — were children.</p><small>2025-07-30 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30104059651bceb.jpg?r=104141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927570/tsunami-waves-reach-hawaii-japan-after-huge-88-magnitude-quake-rattles-russias-far-east' target='_blank'><strong>Tsunami waves reach Hawaii, Japan after huge 8.8-magnitude quake rattles Russia’s Far East</strong></a><br><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) that prompted warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan and across the Pacific Ocean.
Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.
Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 5ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.

What we know so far:

8.8-magnitude quake hit Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula at 8:24am local time (4am PKT)
Several people injured, no casualties reported
Tsunami warnings issued in Japan, Mexico, Hawaii, Ecuador, China, Chile, Costa Rica
Tsunami waves up to 5.7ft hit Japan, Hawaii, California; 10-13ft recorded in parts of Kamchatka
Russian mayor says ‘everyone’ on tsunami-hit islands evacuated


The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.
The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.
The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.

“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.
A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 ft) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.
Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.
“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.
Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.
In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.
Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s TASS state news agency.
“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.
“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”
While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.
Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.
“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.
Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.
“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3 km (1.8 miles) above sea level as a result of the quake, Al Jazeera reported.
“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km [4.9 miles] above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.
KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.
Japan records tsunami waves
The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, Al Jazeera reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK World.
Waves as high as 60cm (1.9ft) were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to NHK.
The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm (0.6ft) earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres (9.8ft).
Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.
According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, Al Jazeera reported.
There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.
Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10ft) to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).
Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.
Footage on public broadcaster NHK showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.
“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told AFP as she left the area with her young daughter.
Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.
Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 tsunami caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.
There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.
Tsunami waves hit Hawaii, California; warnings issued across the Pacific
The Pacific Tsunami warning centre recorded waves measuring up to 5.7ft in Maui, Hawaii, while another high wave of 4.9ft was recorded in Hailo, the BBC reported.
Tsunami waves were “now impacting Hawaii”, the Centre said in an update.
The US National Weather Service confirmed the reports, according to Al Jazeera.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said so far, no waves of consequence have hit the islands, but all flights in and out of Maui were cancelled, Reuters reported.
In light of the tsunami situation, the Department of Transportation in Hawaii announced, in a social media post, the cancellation of all flights to and from Kahului Airport, the main airport in Maui, Al Jazeera reported.
 






Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning — its highest level alert — for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).
“People are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,” the seismology centre said in a warning.
Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.
 






The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.
“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump said in a social media post.
“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”
Tsunami waves have also hit California on the West Coast, according to the National Weather Service. The weather body said the waves hit the coast at 1:12am local time (1:12pm PKT).
 






Earlier, Tsunami alerts were pushed to mobile phones in California, according to local AFP reporters.
The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.
Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.
It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”
In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, AFP reported.
The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.
Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.
“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”
Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, AFP reported.
Meanwhile, China’s tsunami warning centre said that waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard.
“Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Centre of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China,” the advisory centre said.
‘Ring of fire’
Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.
“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.
“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”</p><small>2025-07-30 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3013003358b7160.jpg?r=130108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927588/uk-rejects-criticism-that-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state-rewards-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>UK rejects criticism that move to recognise Palestinian state rewards Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Britain on Wednesday rejected criticism that it was rewarding fighter group Hamas by setting out plans to recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel took steps to improve the situation in Gaza and bring about peace.
The sight of emaciated Gaza children has shocked the world in recent days, and on Tuesday, a hunger monitor warned that a worst-case scenario of famine was unfolding there and immediate action was needed to avoid widespread death.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ultimatum, setting a September deadline for Israel, prompted an immediate rebuke from his counterpart in Jerusalem, who said it rewarded Hamas and punished the victims of their 2023 cross-border attack.
US President Donald Trump said he did not think Hamas “should be rewarded” with recognition of Palestinian independence.
Asked about that criticism, British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander — designated by the government to respond to questions in a series of media interviews on Wednesday — said it was not the right way to characterise Britain’s plan.
“This is not a reward for Hamas. Hamas is a vile terrorist organisation that has committed appalling atrocities. This is about the Palestinian people. It’s about those children that we see in Gaza who are starving to death,” she told LBC radio.
“We’ve got to ratchet up pressure on the Israeli government to lift the restrictions to get aid back into Gaza.”
France announced last week it would recognise Palestinian statehood in September.
Successive British governments have said they would recognise a Palestinian state when it was most effective to do so.
In a televised address on Tuesday, Starmer said that moment had now come, highlighting the suffering in Gaza and saying the prospect of a two-state solution — a Palestinian state co-existing in peace alongside Israel — was under threat.
Starmer said Britain would make the move at the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank and committed to a long-term peace process that delivered a two-state solution.</p><small>2025-07-30 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30123616acc66ae.png?r=125151' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-deal-not-finalised-higher-tariffs-possible' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India deal not finalised, higher tariffs possible</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said a trade deal with India has yet to be finalised and warned of possible higher tariffs ahead of an August 1 deadline to seal an agreement.
His comments followed a Reuters report that India was preparing to accept higher tariffs of 20-25 per cent on its exports to the US in the absence of a trade deal, as it holds off on offering fresh concessions ahead of Friday’s deadline.
“India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs, almost more than any other country,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, adding that it would come to an end.
Asked about the Reuters report, Trump said a trade deal had not been finalised and India could face steeper tariffs.
 


India plans to resume broader trade talks with the US in mid-August when a US delegation is due to visit, hoping to seal a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement by October, Indian officials said.
“Talks are progressing well,” an official said, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a “worst-case scenario”. The official declined to be identified without authorisation to speak to the media.
“But, we assume it would be (a) temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official said.
Trump also reiterated his claim that he helped broker a ceasefire to the conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year, saying both sides accepted his request.
“That was great,” he said describing his friendship with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India disputes Trump’s claims that he brokered the ceasefire.
Analysts say Trump’s remarks on the India-Pakistan conflict have cast a shadow on trade negotiations.
 
 

On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that the India talks require more time, noting Trump wants good deals, not fast ones.
India has shown “strong interest in opening portions of its market” though its trade policy had long focused on protecting domestic interests, Greer said.
 


Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told Reuters last week India was making “fantastic” progress in US trade talks.
Indian officials said New Delhi had offered tariff cuts on a wide range of goods and was working to ease non-tariff barriers.
However, agriculture and dairy remain no-go areas, with India unwilling to allow US imports of genetically modified soybean or corn, or to open its dairy sector.
Total bilateral goods trade reached about $129 billion in 2024, with India posting a surplus of nearly $46bn.
Officials said India was calibrating its strategy amid broader US tariff threats targeting Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others), including India, over issues such as de-dollarisation and Russian oil purchases.

• Mysterious woman accused of ‘trapping’ accused men surfaces in court
ISLAMABAD: A two-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has said any commission formed to investigate the alleged misuse of the blasphemy law could interfere in cases pending before other courts.
The judges on Tuesday explained the reasons for suspending a single bench’s order in the high-profile case.
The now-suspended judgement was issued by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan after 42 hearings in the case whose proceedings were streamed live, in a divergence from the norm.
It directed the federal government to establish an inquiry commission within 30 days to investigate the allegations of entrapment, custodial deaths, flawed investigations and violations of fundamental rights.
The order, issued on July 15, said nearly 400 FIRs and around 700 individuals were implicated for allegedly committing blasphemy online.
 
 

The court also flagged irregularities in FIA’s investigations, including the reuse of Facebook IDs across multiple FIRs, same-day arrests and FIR registrations, private detentions and the use of unverified digital evidence.
Last week, an IHC bench comprising Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Azam Khan heard appeals challenging the single-bench’s ruling.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench suspended for a month the order to form the commission.
During Tuesday’s hearing, the two-judge bench noted the nearly 400 blasphemy cases, at the heart of this issue, were registered nationwide.
The trials in most of these cases had already concluded, resulting in either convictions or acquittals. In some cases, appeals have been filed against those decisions that are currently pending before various high courts.
The order stated that forming an inquiry commission in such a context could interfere with pending, potentially rendering the legal process “ineffective”.
Interim or final order
The two-judge bench also clarified that Justice Khan’s order was final as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
 
 

The question over the order’s status was raised during the last hearing when the petitioners’ lawyer claimed the case was initially decided but the written verdict stated it would remain pending.
The division bench further clarified that although intra-court appeals are typically not filed against interim orders, the single bench’s ruling was final in nature as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
‘Mysterious’ woman
Also on Tuesday, a woman named Komal Ismail also appeared before the division bench along with her lawyer.
She is accused of honey-trapping the victims using a false social media identity by the name of “Imaan”.
In a hearing earlier this month, Justice Khan directed the FIA to block her national identity card after she repeatedly failed to appear before the court.
 
 

During Tuesday’s proceedings, Ms Ismail’s counsel argued her client was not a party in the main case, yet her CNIC was blocked and her name placed on the Exit Control List.
Justice Soomro responded that Ms Ismail had only been asked to appear before the investigating officer and questioned the harm in complying with that direction.
The bench emphasised that while the case involving Ms Ismail remained under investigation, the court would not interfere in the matter.
Later, the court linked Ms Ismail’s applications with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.

•  Officials’ reluctance to share names of mill owners with lawmakers draws rebuke
•  Committee told Rs150m spent out of Rs1.95bn allocated for flood awareness campaign, rest of the money diverted
ISLAMABAD: Amid a hike in sugar price, the Public Accounts Committee was informed on Tuesday that the sugar mills have earned Rs300 billion due to recent fluctuations in the rates of the essential commodity.
The Auditor General of Pakistan made these revelations during the meeting of the apex parliamentary panel, which convened the high-stakes session to review the sugar import and export policy, rising prices, and the lack of transparency in the sugar industry.
The PAC met under the chairmanship of Junaid Akbar Khan and it was briefed by Industries and Production Secretary Saif Anjum, who stated that price regulation and relevant laws fell under provincial jurisdictions.
He revealed that from 2013 to 2023, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) permitted sugar exports amounting to 5.09 million metric tonnes, of which 3.927 million tonnes were actually exported. In 2023-24 alone, the country had a surplus of 1.3 million tonnes, and 790,000 tonnes were cleared for export, the secretary said, adding that the price remained “stable”.
However, the PAC members expressed serious concern, citing ground realities. Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan and other members, including Omar Ayub and Senator Fauzia Arshad, contradicted the government’s claims about the commodity.
Omar Ayub reported that sugar was selling for over Rs200 per kilogramme in many regions, while National Food Secu­rity Secr­etary Amir Mohy­uddin maintained the national average was Rs173. According to Senator Fauzia Arshad, sugar had become both scarce and unaffordable.
‘Cycle of mismanagement’
Mr Akbar, meanwhile, slammed the cycle of mismanagement, stating, “Every year we repeat the same drama: first export (sugar), then import it.”
The PTI lawmaker questioned the lack of transparency, asking, “Who owns these sugar mills?” The committee had requested a list of owners, but the industries secretary said only directors’ names were available.
 
 

The committee rejected this explanation, demanding complete records. It warned, “No further briefings will be accepted without disclosure of owners.”
The Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) also drew flak for failing to regulate the industry effectively. “This is daylight robbery,” said MNA Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood, citing massive profiteering and poor governance. “Rs287 billion have gone into a few pockets,” claimed MNA Riaz Fatyana, while others accused the president and prime minister of allegedly protecting the profiteers.
The Federal Board of Revenue officials told the panel that a list of mills’ directors had been obtained, but the lawmakers sought full ownership transparency, leading to heated exchanges among the members.
Malik Amir Dogar named President Asif Ali Zardari, Jahangir Tareen, and the ruling Sharif family as major sugar mill stakeholders, leading to fiery arguments with fellow lawmakers Shazia Marri, Afnanullah Khan, and Bilal Mandokhail.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan noted that only 42 families profited from this massive windfall. “Why is no one else allowed to set up sugar mills?” he questioned, pointing to the concentration of ownership and lack of competition.
PAC member Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood highlighted that sugar was currently available in India at the equivalent of Rs143/kg, much cheaper than local prices.
The food secretary responded that the reduction in sales and other taxes was intended to make sugar more affordable. However, he warned that an import duty of Rs80 per kg would naturally make imported sugar more expensive.
The PAC chairman also questioned the rationale behind importing sugar despite claims from all provinces that ample stock was available. “If there was enough stock, why was the decision made to import it?” he asked.
 
 

Regarding sugar stocks, officials claimed 1.9 million tonnes were available, which will last till November. Nonetheless, PAC members voiced concern about potential spoilage and stressed the need for careful planning ahead of the next crushing season. The government had approved the import of 300,000 tons of sugar to stabilise the supply, while pledging it would not affect farmers or involve previous export destinations.
The PAC members reiterated that the issue would not be dropped until full transparency over sugar mill ownership and profit beneficiaries was achieved. Separately, the PAC scrutinised Rs1.95 billion supplementary grant allocated to the Press Information Department for a flood awareness campaign. Audit officials revealed that only Rs150 million was spent on the campaign, while the rest was diverted elsewhere. The matter was referred to a subcommittee for investigation.

Seventeen countries plus the European Union and Arab League threw their weight behind a seven-page text agreed at a United Nations conference on reviving the two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international enga­gement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Pales­tinian State,” said the declaration.
It followed a call on Monday by the Palestinian delegation at the United Nations for both Israel and Hamas to leave Gaza, allowing the Palestinian Authority to administer the coastal territory. The text also condemned the Hamas raid against Israel of Oct 7, 2023.
France, which co-chaired the conference with Saudi Arabia, called the declaration “both historic and unprecedented.”
“For the first time, Arab countries and those in the Middle East condemn Hamas, condemn Oct 7, call for the disarmament of Hamas, call for its exclusion from Palestinian governance, and clearly express their intention to normalise relations with Israel in the future,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot.

• Amit Shah says three Pahalgam attackers killed; Farooq Abdullah wonders whether they were the same men
• Congress leader challenges Modi to say ‘Trump is lying’ on role in ending hostilities with Pakistan
NEW DELHI: In a bedlam of barbs and innuendoes in India’s parliament on Tuesday, the BJP government claimed teaching Pakistan a lesson in their recent military standoff.
But the leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of cowardice in not taking Pakistan head-on, while forcing the army and the air force to avoid military targets at the start of the war.
India, Mr Gandhi added, could not afford Modi as prime minister.
For his part, the Indian PM applauded his achievements in the hunt for those who killed 26 Hindu tourists in Pahalgam on April 22.
As if on cue, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that three of the terrorists had been killed and that two of them were identified as members of the now-defunct Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
Farooq Abdullah, a former chief minister of India-held Kashmir, welcomed Shah’s claim with a caveat, wondering if they were indeed the same men who attacked tourists in scenic Pahalgam.
Claiming all-round success in the short war, Narendra Modi kept scrupulously silent on the losses of Indian aircraft in the air battle with the Pakistan Air Force.
He spoke in Hindi, with plenty of pauses for dramatic effect. Like when he spoke about how the opposition leaders were asking why he did not take back Azad Kashmir: “Who else can they ask this to except me?”
India, he said, had called Pakistan’s “nuclear bluff”, and showed the world it would no longer be cowed by threats of escalation.
Shift in strategic posture
He claimed India struck “terror bases deep inside Pakistan” in just 22 minutes after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and that “Islamabad’s sabre-rattling, including veiled nuclear threats, did not stop India from responding forcefully”.
It is worth noting that Indian military officials have previously said there was never a moment of nuclear threat from either side.
“Pakistan had some inkling of Indian action and started issuing nuclear threats, but could do nothing when terror targets were hit,” Modi said.
“India responds on its own terms; bullets will be met with cannons.”
This response, he claimed, exposed the limits of Pakistan’s deterrence and revealed a shift in India’s strategic posture. “Only three countries spoke for Pakistan at the UN,” he said, but didn’t say how many spoke for India.
Rahul Gandhi had said in his speech that many countries had condemned terrorism, but none had condemned Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
“No leader of any country asked India to stop any action in its defence against terror,” PM Modi said.
US Vice President J.D. Vance had tried calling him “three-four times” during Operation Sindoor, the Indian PM claimed, but he was too busy in high-level meetings with the armed forces.
Rahul’s challenge to Modi
Before Mr Modi’s speech, Rahul Gandhi had thrown a dare at the PM, pointing out President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of having stopped the war between India and Pakistan. “If Trump is lying, let Modi say he is lying,” Rahul had said.
Modi claimed Operation Sindoor had “planted India’s flag firmly in the global defence market” and there was an increasing interest in India-made munitions.
He also repeated the Indian claim that Pakistani military officials pleaded for a halt in hostilities.
He said former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had cost India dearly with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Modi called the treaty as unfair to India’s farmers, saying “blood and water cannot flow together”.
There was no mention of the losses India suffered in the prime minister’s speech. Several opposition leaders in both houses had asked for details on how many fighter jets, including Rafales, were lost.
Mr Gandhi claimed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had himself revealed that the Director General of Military Operations was told by the Government of India to ask for a ceasefire just 30 minutes after Operation Sindoor began. “You told them we will not hit military targets; we do not want escalation.”
“The government of India informed the government of Pakistan that we have no political will, and we will not fight,” he said.
Mr Gandhi also quoted Captain Shiv Kumar, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, as saying that India had lost some aircraft and that happened only because of the constraints given by the political leadership not to attack air defence and military targets. “You tied their hands behind their backs and the defence minister has said this in parliament itself.”

The people had to leave different villages in Taunsa, including Mauza Moor Jhangi, Bait Kachhela, Panj Darain, Bait Channar, Bait Ashraf, Jarh Leghari and Mouza Baloch Khan.
In Layyah, the people were evacuated from Mouza Lohaj, Thori, Samra Jhok Khan, Basti Kanjo Mohana, Darkhan Khokhar, Panwar, Alliyani Basti, and Rakhwan. A double-storey police check post built in Rakhwan was also submerged completely by floodwater and all its structure demolished. A high school in Basti Alliyani also submerged by water and cracks appeared in its building.
In Karor Lal Esan, Bait Mongar was also flooded and all its houses and mosque were also destroyed. The floodwater entered cultivated lands, making it a part of the river in Layyah and Karor Lal Esan.
In Dera Ghazi Khan, several villages were submerged by floodwater including Jhok Utra, Kot Chuta, Malkani Kalan.

DG Khan residents protest turning of river for new Layyah-Taunsa Bridge

The residents of the area protested against poor management of a bund built to turn the river to construct Layyah-Taunsa Bridge. They said that the river had changed its way and started flowing in another direction, engulfing thousands of agriculture land where different crops, including cotton, were destroyed by the medium level flood.
“A high level flood in the past would easily pass from Layyah but the poor design of the newly-constructed Layyah-Taunsa bridge changed the flow of the river and it started flooding old localities and villages. Thousands of acres of crops also come under water in both districts,” the locals said.
The crack emerged in the bank of the river to protect the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge also could not be filled after two days due to poor management of the authorities.
A resident of Layyah Khurrum Khar told Dawn that out of their 450 acres, only 175 acres was left dry and all their land had been swallowed up by the Sindh river.
He also said the government had changed the way of the river to construct the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge and it resulted in catastrophe for their land.
“We only can demand the government to fix the problem otherwise we would become landless and the river will also swallow our villages permanently,” the man decried.
Earlier, the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert for several regions as the province braces for rising water levels in major rivers and urban flooding due to more heavy monsoon rains.
According to the Pakistan Met Department (PMD), scattered to widespread thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls are expected over the upper catchments of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, and Ravi rivers, as well as in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, and Lahore divisions over the next 48 hours.
The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has reported that the Indus river is currently at medium flood level at Guddu, while low flood conditions persist at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, Taunsa, and Sukkur.
Meanwhile, the Jhelum and Chenab rivers are experiencing low to medium-level flows and more flow is expected due to an incoming weather system from July 30 to 31. The FFD also warned of moderate flooding in the nullahs of the Ravi river and tributaries of the Kabul river, with increased flows expected in the Sutlej river at Ganda Singhwala after 24 hours. Urban flooding is likely in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Lahore.
PDMA Punjab issued alerts to commissioners and deputy commissioners of multiple divisions, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur.
Relief Commissioner Punjab Nabeel Javed directed officials to remain vigilant and ensure all precautionary measures are in place.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia emphasized the need for advanced preparations, including the activation of emergency control rooms and disaster response teams.
He urged the public to cooperate with administration efforts, particularly in evacuation procedures for riverside settlements and livestock.
Reservoir levels remain under watch, with Tarbela Dam at 87.08% live storage and Mangla Dam at 57.36%. Historical data indicates the potential for significant peaks, though current forecasts suggest manageable conditions.
The Punjab government has assured citizens of comprehensive support, including food, clean water, and medical aid at relief camps.

The Thari villagers and their pereẽ, who specialises in reading footprints in the sand, tracked the camels to a village across state lines, but they had to cough up 180 rupees in bhung or gratification to get them back. As camel stealing was not a cognisable offence under the Indian Extradition Act of 1903, however, the police could not arrest the thieves and extradite them to face punishment. Amending the law was out of the question, the correspondence debated, and so would a Border Badmash Conference be considered to tackle the menace?
 


Exactly 100 years later, the Tharis are still complaining of camel snatchings, but with one anthropological exception — they can no longer play detective in the desert. You see, it is impossible to track footprints on a road, whose construction in the 21st century changed all that.
I recently went to Tharparkar to report on these and other complaints, for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which was holding its first ever camps in the district’s four main towns. The Commission had invited people from all over to talk about the violations they face, their problems and what they consider are their remedies. It wanted me to travel from Karachi to Islamkot with its team, stay overnight and then head to one camp being held in Nagar. The trip would wrap up the next day in Mithi at a meeting with members of civil society. My job was to write the information shared at the camp within 3,000 words. This was a task that should have barely taken a week but it took me three months. For you to understand why, allow me to take you back to the first night, in Islamkot.
Urine theft
My nanny for this visit is a socialist Thari of indeterminate age, S— sahib, whom I adore at first sight because he carries the air of someone who knows the land and has kept its time. Most of all, he understands that I am a foreigner who will need Thar to be translated. I am already fearful no ethical reporting can come out of parachuting in, hoovering up a few interviews and dressing them up as a feature.
I confide in S— sahib a self-conscious burden that writing about Tharparkar risks having an anaesthetic effect on the reader. If by some miracle, however, they remain conscious beyond the second paragraph, the sedative is sure to set in once the two inescapable topics of hydrology and petrology make an appearance. You feel compelled to always mention that there isn’t enough water in Thar but there are stupid amounts of coal.
Mercifully, S— sahib understands my predicament and elegantly plans an off-the-cuff briefing for me with his friends, a group of journalists, doctors, activists, tradesmen and babus. And so, on our first evening in Islamkot we head to dinner at a Hindu businessman’s office in the bazaar.
 

A UNOCHA map showing Thar’s road network circa 2023.

S— sahib’s group of friends tolerates my infantile questions on their material circumstances. As the evening wears on and my ink runs out, however, I dread that I’ve heard it all before: the necessities of civic life are in short supply but government neglect is in ample abundance. Thar does not have rain, colleges, hospitals and intolerance, but it does have deaf revenue officers, a land mafia and simplicity. To make matters worse, my ability to process all this information for a story is compromised by hypoglycaemia. It is well past my dinner time.
Suddenly, our host, the businessman, heaves himself up and proclaims, “What’s the matter S— sahib, won’t you have something to drink?” It dawns on me that my presence has probably had an inhibitory effect on the katchehri.
S— sahib does not answer and casts around the room for moral support, but his friends abandon him to disappear into their cell phones or check their manicures with their teeth.
“Well, I’ll have one.”
Our host freezes in the middle of proffering options extracted from his desk drawer. Everyone’s eyes snap to me.
I sit back and cock my head.
The businessman laughs. “Well, S— sahib,” he says with a twinkle in his eye, “What’s it gonna be?” And without bothering to wait for an answer, he plonks down the Toyo Nasic glasses and hollers for ice.
Relieved laughter defrosts the room. The gamble paid off. They feel as if I am one of them and can speak freely now.
This marked a turning point in my assignment, and so what follows below is as tight a version as I can muster of what I heard over three days in Thar. This includes insights I had the privilege to hear as a ‘female reporter’ in a room full of Sindhi- and Dhātki-speaking Meghwars, Lohanas, Sharmas and Kumars in Islamkot. Much of what these men said was corroborated by the villagers and townsfolk who spoke at the camp the next day and at the consultation in Mithi the next. By the end of the visit, I suspected that one single ailment could perhaps convey what they were all speaking of: the injury caused by Thar’s violent encounter with Capitalism. Allow me to make the case.
The Road

Tharis are not nature’s favoured subjects. It conspires against them from subterranean depths by offering up eyewatering supplies of black gold, rendering them vulnerable to corporate greed, displacement and ecological disaster. Meanwhile, it is tight-fisted with another precious resource, water, from on high above, leaving them to battle droughts every two to three years.
Qehet and coal gave Musharraf reason enough in the 2000s to decide that the desert needed to be open for business. The red carpet was rolled out, as a network of roads connecting towns like never before. The Road has since acquired metonymic status with Thari time being marked by the phrase Jab Road bana, just as Muhammad bin Qasim’s arrival is given as the beginning of Sindh’s official history in textbooks.
 

A recent photo of the Thar coal power plant in block 1. Only two out of 12 blocks have activity.

The Road made it possible for outsiders — businessmen, middlemen, opportunists — to penetrate a land that had otherwise been shut off for centuries, so much so that the Tharis began to complain that they stopped being able to recognise faces in the market. Theft and robbery went up, bringing with it a sense of insecurity that had never before been experienced here. (For an in-depth study, consider Arif Hasan’s Tharparkar: Drought, Development And Social Change)
The Road made Thar known to the rest of Pakistan and as a result of the drought, one of the first things that the new media access paid attention to were the dying babies. In reaction, sarkar and other saviours decided the solution was to bankroll nutrition programs and cash handouts. Even today, pregnant women, new mothers and children receive about Rs3,000 each a month under the Benazir Income Support Programme. The government doctor at the katchehri felt that these interventions have had a corrupting effect on Thari society. “Naturally, when one woman receives that money, she tells the others,” he said, before going on to confess his own capitulation. He could take one pregnant woman’s urine and make it possible for three non-gravid women to cash in. “It’s the truth, why should I lie?” he added. (I was not able to independently verify his claims.)
These so-called ‘fake’ pregnancies aren’t even what needs to be investigated, for Rs3,000 a month hardly enriches households under the poverty line. What the doctor claimed next is worrying: Women are having more babies — for cash. “They talk about family planning,” he scoffed, “but at the same time, they are giving money to encourage people to have more children.” His correlation between welfare checks and fertility rates is a tenuous one at best, but these remarks deepen my suspicion that government and non-government decision-making is doing more harm than good in a place like this.
Identity theft
I was further persuaded that it has always been easy to do systemic violence in Thar when I learnt how its very name came about. There was no such thing as ‘Tharparkar’ until the British squished together Thar and Parkar when they turned it into a district in the 1900s. This region was actually called Dhāt, and it was part of the Greater Rajputana states (Rajasthan desert). Parkar was an entirely separate region in Kutch.
This history lesson unfolded in Chhachhro, which nanny S— had persuaded me with his geriatric flirtations to go to, instead of Nagar, my original assignment. No one ever goes to Chhachhro, he told me. Indeed, this taluka’s sense of isolation became clear at its press club, where I was greeted with wonderment by activists Ali Akbar Rahimoo and Gautam Rathi. “We ourselves were wondering how come the HRCP had chosen to organise a camp here,” Ali Akbar said. “No one ever comes to Chhachhro.” In fact, when he sent out invitations for the HRCP human rights camp, people were confused. Did he want them to have their eyesight checked like at a medical camp?
Before the session began, Gautam Rathi and Ali Akbar felt I must understand the contours of Chhachhro’s history, which sets it apart from Thar’s and would help me understand present-day concerns.
Crucially, they say, up until the British showed up here, all this land was collectively owned and people lived close to water (wells and tarais or natural ponds). Throughout history, the Tharis lived off their livestock and whatever they could grow and barter (milk, ghee, wool, leather). The British introduced the ‘Rani Chaap’ coins with the Queen’s relief, a police force and a Revenue system and by 1930 had started granting people state land. But even then, the gowcher was left untouched so everyone’s animals could graze freely.

The British stayed here for about a hundred years, building dispensaries and schools, which made them well-liked by the Thari people who had not experienced governance in this shape before under Muslim Talpur, Kalhoro and Rajputana conquerors. The phrase, ‘Jee bhoora tina’ (lit. you did the White man thing) is still used today as praise for accomplishing what no one else does. When it came time for the British to leave at Partition in 1947, there was a general disbelief compounded by the upheaval caused by migrations.

The other major shaper of Thari history was the war with India in 1965, when this area was severed from Rajasthan. Thari Hindus were viewed with suspicion as they had family ties in India, giving the government a reason to step up surveillance. Paranoia ratcheted up by 1971 when India took over Chhachhro briefly and gutted it. It was only two years later, after the Shimla agreement, that the district was returned to Pakistan. It took a while for men to rebuild Chhachhro and for a long time it was known as the town of single men because it was unfit for families.
This historical tangent explains why Chhachhro was kept hermetically sealed up to 2001, so it could act as a buffer zone with India. “Since the 1971 war,” said one man at the camp, “The state of Pakistan has never treated [the people of] Tharparkar like a proper citizenry. We survive here like a colony.” There could be no roads into it, no TV, no tourists, no radio. That is why, the men told me, when The Road was built in the 2000s, everything changed.
The wrong address
Chhachhro Press Club is a no-computer, no furniture affair on the town’s main road. The HRCP organisers elect to seat people indoors and they leave the black refrigerator-sized speaker in the driveway. In a stroke of marketing genius, Ali Akbar Rahimoo tells the HRCP volunteers to keep the boombox facing the street so anyone who had gone about their business in town that day was sure to have heard about two dozen men blast out an untrammelled stream of anger about what was happening from villages Tar Dos to Khensar. HRCP didn’t need social media. It just held a five-hour organic live audio broadcast.

He is known as the encyclopedia of Thar because of his vast knowledge of its history and customs.

Some men spoke into the microphone with hands squarely gripping the lectern. Then there were others who had come clutching files and stood like children. They held back from the mic as if it were an unpredictable object that would steal their voice. They had come from all over Chhachhro and the new tehsil Dahli, which together are home to about a third of Thar’s population. Despite their scale, however, both districts are so thin on government presence that you have to drive two hours to Mithi to get any official business done. Dahli still doesn’t have a press club, and thus you never really hear about it.
You might assume that water scarcity topped the list of speaker priorities. It didn’t. Another natural resource, one that is in obscene amounts, emerged as the root of human rights violations: land. Gul Sher, a dignified young man whose family has lived in Khokhrapar for nine generations or three hundred years, came bearing news that about 800 sq km at the border had been sold to private companies. “But in the eyes of the law, none of this land belongs to us,” he said. “There are no ownership documents — nothing that proves we exist here.”

I was expecting people to talk about garden variety human rights abuses (enforced disappearances, religious discrimination) at the HRCP camp for this is what we are used to hearing in Pakistan. And while they may very well be taking place at some scale, a far greater collective violence is being visited upon this land. It is just not visibly perpetrated by other humans as it is linked to the way people are impacted by the invisible flow of Capital and the alienation and abstraction it creates.
Tharis are constantly at risk of dislocation and dispossession even though they are perhaps the only people in Pakistan who all own homes, even if it is a thatched hut. The trouble is that they do not have the papers to prove it because the government has not surveyed the land. (A project was abandoned with only Kaloi and Islamkot covered two years ago). Proof lies in the number of court cases, which lawyer Shaukat Sindhi mentioned in Mithi. “Naturally, people will end up killing each other over plots,” he said. “The shame is that some of them are dying for fifty square yards, which is barely worth fifty thousand rupees.”

A map (above) explains why the Tharis are worried and the lack of a land survey could lead to widespread long-term inequalities. In the centre of Thar is a great 9,000 sq km chunk of land under which coal has been found. People fear they will have to eventually be told to vacate it. If Thar is 19,000 sq km large, that leaves about 10,000 sq km for the population. The government claims that half of the remaining land is cultivable and half is not.
Even if you go by the government’s standards and divide the cultivable half, that leaves 3.5 acres per family. Ali Akbar, who proposed this quick math, said, “Just computerise the land records for each family’s 3.5 acres at least. Do it and get it over with and do us all a favour.” If the Thari right to land were acknowledged, they could lease their property to outsiders and have proprietary and financial protection.
Selective application of state power leaves vacuums where local muscle can flex and businessmen can benefit from the absence of regulation. No one helps when feudals cut off access to gowcher by blocking pathways. Kalo Meghwar, in a scarlet turban, fluffy dhoti and scuffed brogues, said his graveyard, gowcher and pond have been taken over for four years by a badmash. “Our things are stolen, our homes are taken over, but since we are poor, we can’t take names,” he said. “The last time I took names, they treated me badly.” He stopped complaining three years ago but it has become too much. The HRCP team pressed him to be specific, but eventually let him be. There could have been informants in the room.
In a way, the Tharis are fighting less for their own human rights and more for their animals’ right to thrive and flourish. “Our way of rearing the livestock is centuries old,” said Dr Mashooq Ali in Mithi. “You go to any village and people don’t even know a Livestock Department exists, Animal Husbandry Department exists.” If this region is home to eight million or 15pc of Sindh’s livestock, why has more research not been done? Why don’t the three hundred veterinary centres work so the animals are vaccinated and can receive first aid? How can forty veterinary staffers for the district cater to eight million animals? Even if the vet makes it to your village in five hours, you won’t have the five thousand rupees to pay him for a sick goat.

Shopfront government
I would be doing a disservice to the people I met at the human rights camp by merely regurgitating what they said and not conveying the sophistication with which they said it. Each man made a concerted effort not to repeat what the previous speakers had said and instead add to the knowledge being shared. It was as if everyone valued the time and effort all of us had made to travel to Chhachhro and wanted to ensure that the HRCP team received as diverse a briefing as possible. (Usually at seminars, men will not stop speaking until you pry the mic from their necrotic hands). No, here I was witnessing something else: the spirit of community and mutual respect.
The men’s complaints were not discrete; something deeper connected them all. In my search for answers, I stumbled across a few thinkers whose theories fit beautifully (Claude Lévi-Strauss, David Harvey, Arturo Escobar, James C Scott, James Ferguson for those interested). The more I read their work, the more Thar seemed like a textbook example of a violent encounter with modernity.
Isolated places like it disintegrate when the powerful forces of modernity arrive at its doorstep — in this case because coal was discovered. Capitalism speeds up the collapse of such a society because it introduces the logics of profit, individualism and accelerated time. A self-sufficient region that fed, clothed and housed itself, is told that it is primitive and backward and needs to live better, easier, healthier, richer. They replace barter with cash, eat into gowcher for roads and railways, and introduce digital banking. A family who managed with their livestock and open land is forced into daily wage labour so its children can buy ten-rupee factory biscuits from Karachi.
When a coal-hungry State becomes interested in places like Thar then, they first have to make it easy to navigate and decipher. They need to be made ‘legible’ so maps, surveys and roads are drawn on what is considered a blank slate. As this new system is codified and becomes the formal documented way to manage Thar, intangible local knowledge and autonomy is replaced. The Road erases the centuries old wisdom of tracking prints in the sand.
The Road made it possible to penetrate the land so that Capitalism could invade the commons (gowcher and tarais) and turn them into profit-generating assets.
Corporations can now extract minerals, exploit labour, eat up land shared between villages. This is called accumulation by dispossession. Mandir leader Krishan Sharma gave an example of it in Mithi: “There is so much talk about Thar coal that little space is left for Thar salt.” At the border, the Sindh government has given corporate giant Hubsalt leases. Its machinery at plants in Ankerio and Mokhai process more salt than labourers can by hand. The mazdoor who would be able to make a year’s living in the saltflat in the winter has been replaced, I was told.
A reservoir was built with water taken from Nabisar village but it is meant to cool the power plant, not people. That plant sends 2700MW to the grid but the place it comes from doesn’t even get 10MW. Meanwhile, people have to shell out Rs18,000 for water tankers. “They say that Thar will change Pakistan,” scoffed activist Qamaruddin Rahimoo in Chhachhro. “But who will change Pakistan? They’ve discovered coal! Well, you expect us to eat coal? There is no light where they found coal.”
Even Thar rail is a cruel joke, they said, because not only is the government taking their land, it is cutting trees to make way for it — sheer blasphemy as one tree feeds 12 goats. They watched in horror as an NED university campus was built on what they say was a swathe of gowcher. Is all this construction even necessary? “For the last 15 years, Tharparkar has been a resource dumping site,” argues Ali Akbar. “There has been so much civil work here, you cannot even fathom it. You are making two-two hundred dispensaries.” The airport is just for the ‘corporates’ because Tharis certainly can’t afford the fare.
The rush to modernise and spend money is called ‘isomorphic mimicry’. The State copies what it thinks looks modern but without actually building capability to make it work. This is why Ghulam Murtaza Samejo said all he could report on the performance of elected union councillors is that tiles have been installed from the chowk to the press club with the Rs1.2 million Chhachhro budget. The town is otherwise turning into a garbage dump. Isomorphic mimicry is why only a fraction of the reverse osmosis plants work today and their staff is either not paid or their pay grazes the minimum wage. This applies to the health unit opened in Musharraf’s time. It was upgraded to a taluka headquarters hospital and given a brand new takhti, but it is still operating with its original 20 beds, according to Qamaruddin Rahimoo.
I hear you saying: But who is against development? Surely the Tharis wanted The Road. In each town I visited, people demanded connecting roads, electricity, water, hospitals, fresh textbooks every school year. No one wants isolation, to be hungry or not have food and medicine. The trouble with the way in which this kind of ‘modernity’ arrives is who decides it, who benefits and who is left out. The government and not the Tharis decide where the roads will be built. These roads are then marketed as a public good. Development does not solve problems, but redefines them to fit the logic of intervention.
I should mention here that the aforementioned theorists never said that traditional societies are devoid of injustice or their own cruelties. But removing them in the name of progress leads to collapse. As long as Tharis are not calling the shots, the burra sahib is merely replaced by the babu in Islamabad. It is no coincidence that Thar’s MNAs and MPAs were not even from Thar (but pirs such as the Jeelanis, Makhdooms, Mirs of Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Umarkot) up until The Road was built. In the meantime, infrastructure and energy projects have all been decided elsewhere.
Fall sick with the healing
The clearest evidence of this systemic violence done in the name of modernity with the machinery of Capitalism then, to my mind, is the suicide, and they were on everyone’s lips. About seven Tharis per 100,000 are killing themselves each year. I suspect, each individual case’s reasons aside, this is an expression of helplessness in a society whose culture is atrophying, people are being exploited and entire lifeways are being erased.
Early media coverage led to some government attention. A study was done, journalists were bussed in to scratch around, and a toll-free helpline was set up — imagine the Tharis dialing in. Mobile phone brain rot and unrequited love top the list of culprits but no one was satisfied with these explanations at the Mithi consultation. Lawyer Bhooro Mal Kohli wanted to know why every case of a young woman’s suicide is put down to one explanation: her “zehni tawazun” or mental balance was not right. Others said suicides are taking place when people cannot pay back their microfinance loans.
One reason for the lack of agreement on the cause of suicides is the absence of post-mortems. They are legally required in suspected cases but the police have to back off if the community resists. Then there are logistical challenges, according to SSP Adil Memon who oversees the district. If a person dies by suicide in a disconnected part of Thar, moving the body to a centre for a post-mortem is expensive. He has to dedicate an officer to take the tissue samples all the way to the nearest serologist, in Sukkur. Chhachhro does not have a woman MLO and even where they are available, they are reluctant to do a case because they will have to keep showing up in court.
An economist’s blueprint
Plenty of plans for Tharparkar are afoot but I find their self-confidence frightening so I ask what the Tharis would prefer as a solution and one man’s name kept coming up: economist Dr Kaiser Bengali.
I was told that his poverty reduction plan for Sindh had methods that would work for Thar as he understood how ‘development’ should take place without ruining the region. There should be a town every 40km, rainwater harvesting and mobile schools and healthcare facilties. These plans did not prioritise cement-heavy spending and were actually approved by the cabinet in 2021, but he says, it hasn’t been put into action.
 

This map from the Sindh poverty reduction plan for Tharparkar shows settlements dotted across the district. This is a highly unusual pattern because no clusters or densities exist. People spread themselves out over Thar because water was so scarce. Economists such as Kaiser Bengali now say that any planning should work with the natural patterns as much as possible and not gun for high-rise dense city formations generally considered the norm and solution elsewhere in Pakistan so the government can attend to as many people as possible in as small a space.

Dr Bengali’s plan finds favour because it takes its cues from Thari knowledge. Take, for instance, how the people have dwelled in the desert. Maps show villages dotted nearly equidistantly; the Tharis spaced themselves out by the location of wells and availability of water. There are no dense cities.
This principle flies in the face of modern city planning. A state cannot afford to set up and manage a hospital for a five-hut village but it could for a cluster of villages with a population of 10,000. Dr Bengali’s answer takes the middle ground by proposing rural clusters, which he says has already worked in Sujawal’s Chohar Jamali where they built 17 roads at a 40-km radius to connect villages. Other proposals to the government have specified a 10-km distance, according to work done by Sohail Sangi, Ali Akbar Rahimoo and a few other Thari activists.
The formula takes it a step further by giving rural growth centres functionality: Mithi for government, Nagar for the coal industry and so on. But all this has to happen soon for the land mafia has a free hand. Dr Bengali says the size of plots have to be policed so density does not develop given the water scarcity.
When I argue with Dr Bengali that Capitalist forces destroy cultures, he is blunt: “That culture [you are talking about] in Thar was largely starvation.” His prescription for it smarts even more. “Chhachhro should be phased out,” he says. “There is simply no water there.” It should not become a high-density population area. He even believes that livestock should stop being a source of livelihood as it is too water-intensive. Half of the animals die in the drought anyway, he says primly.
Dr Bengali’s attitude may be deflating but his formula is promising. I come away from this brief exposure to people in Islamkot, Mithi and Chhachhro certain of only one thing: it is not that easy to run Thar because the usual methods do more damage even if they seem to deliver.
What happens in Thar, stays in Thar
As S— sahib wraps up the katchehri in Islamkot and I exchange telephone numbers with the group of men, a chorus of protests erupt. This is zyadti [unfair], I am told, “You didn’t finish.”
Nanny S— gravely tells the group. “This is a test for us. Ye hamara imtehan hai: How much we keep this to ourselves is our zarf. A sahafi will do anything for their story.” I have a feeling he is referring to me.
But the others understand. What happened here, says one of them. “Kia hua?”
“Nothing,” I reply. “I have no idea.
What happened?” I gather up my notebook, bag and prepare to leave.
Yes, we didn’t see anything, comes the reply.
And so, on that cool night in Islamkot, deep in the heart of Dhāt, no one saw anything. There was no story to tell. No one was the wiser.

Pakistan has lately seen a surge in terrorism across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has also worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.
“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement said.
Field Marshall Munir also shed light on Pakistan’s recent military escalation with India, condemning New Delhi’s “blatant sponsorship of terror proxies, characterising them as a failed attempt to target the deep-rooted patriotism of the people of Balochistan.”
The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
He elucidated that India, having suffered defeat in Marka-i-Haq — the period of conflict from April 22 to May 10 — had “now escalated its proxy war to advance her nefarious designs.”
He said New Delhi was using Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan — terms the state uses to refer to the TTP and terrorist groups in Balochistan, respectively — as “pawns of Indian hybrid war against Pakistan.”
“The COAS said that these proxies will face a similar fate and humiliation as faced in Marka-i-Haq,” the statement said.
During his talk, the army chief also emphasised that terrorists knew no bounds of religion, sect, or ethnicity, necessitating a unified national response, stressing the imperative of collective resolve in confronting this menace.
He highlighted the “pivotal role of development initiatives in Balochistan, advocating for enhanced inter-agency cooperation and a cohesive national approach to propel provincial progress and national advancement.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace, the COAS underscored the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, protecting national prestige and ensuring the well-being of its citizens, the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-07-30 05:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/300951585eaf71e.png?r=095205' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927550/bisp-not-probing-any-irregularities-involving-miftahs-firm-chairperson' target='_blank'><strong>BISP not probing  any ‘irregularities’ involving Miftah’s firm: chairperson</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The head of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has said the organisation was not investigating alleged irregularities involving the company of former finance minister Miftah Ismail.
“BISP is not investigating the case but those involved in any wrongdoing must be punished,” BISP Chairperson Rubina Khalid said in a press briefing on Tuesday.
She was referring to allegations that Mr Ismail’s family company unfairly benefited from World Food Programme (WFP) contracts linked to the Benazir Nashonuma Programme (BNP), a BISP initiative to address stunting among pregnant and lactating women and their children.
Last week, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in the Senate that a former finance minister had increased the budget of BNP at a time when his company was the sole supplier of specialised nutritional food under the programme.

Rubina hails nutrition programme’s impact on mothers and children

The minister didn’t name Mr Ismail, who is a critic of the current government. The former finance minister has rejected the allegations and called them politically motivated.
Ms Khalid said the controversy about the allocation would not affect the while programme, which according to official data so far has benefitted 645,800 pregnant women and 630,000 children.
“It is a wonderful programme to take care of mothers and children by providing healthy nutrition for two years since birth,” she added.
She credited the programme for cutting the rate of stunting in children by more than six per cent.
Exit strategy
While talking about BISP’s effectiveness and it’s impact, Ms Khalid rejected the impression that the programme was “turning people into beggars.”
She said BISP was a support programme and did not bar anyone from doing job or business.
“We give a quarterly stipend of Rs13,500 to the beneficiaries, which means Rs4,500 per month. No one can run their house with this meagre amount, but it somehow reduces the gap between income and expenditure of the poor class,” Ms Khalid added.
She said BISP’s Hunarmand Programme was aimed at providing financial and technical assistance to the deserving students.
“Recently, two students who have benefited from the programme have clinched top positions in Class X in Multan,” she added.
When asked about steps taken to protect women beneficiaries from fraud, Ms Khalid said a new project was being launched on Aug 14 under which bank accounts of the beneficiaries will be opened in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Quetta, Gilgit and Muzzaffarabad, etc.
She said the programme has chalked out an “exit strategy” to see if the programme is having a tangible impact on people’s social status.
Under the strategy, more than 10 million beneficiaries of BISP will have to verify their status every three years.
The strategy has been implemented from June to determine whether the beneficiary’s monetary status has improved.
If any improvement in their financial status is confirmed, the said beneficiary will be removed from BISP’s beneficiaries’ data, Ms Khalid added.

Minister for Housing Riaz Hussain Pirzada reached out to Allama Dr Shabbir Hassan Maisami, while Punjab Governor Salim Haider talked to Allama Arif Hussain Wahidi, secretary general of the council, by phone.
The engagements reportedly focused on the difficulties pilgrims were facing due to the government’s decision to bar them from travelling to Iran and Iraq by road.
The SUC leaders said a significant number of pilgrims travel by road through Balochistan every year to visit holy sites in the two countries.
They told the government functionaries that the ban had triggered widespread concern and unrest among the pilgrims who had planned to visit Karbala for Arbaeen, the annual observance of the Chehlum of Imam Husain.
Sources within the SUC confirmed that government representatives had assured them of further consultations and of exploring viable options to resolve the matter.
Earlier, the SUC had publicly rejected the government’s move, calling it a violation of the pilgrims’ fundamental rights.
MWM slams decision
Senator Allama Nasir Abbas, a leader of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslim­een, criticised the federal government’s decision to impose travel restrictions on pilgrims.
Senator Abbas made it clear that every year “almost a million people belonging to both Shia and Sunni schools of thought travel to Iraq for pilgrimage during this sacred occasion, but now they are being denied the right to perform their religious duties.”
He recalled that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had recently visited Iran, where he held talks with his Iranian and Iraqi counterparts about facilitating travel for Pakistani pilgrims. “But without any consultation or prior notice, the government abruptly declared that no one will be allowed to travel by road,” he added.

• UK moves towards ‘recognition’ of Palestinian state; Ishaq Dar calls it ‘test case’ for the world
GAZA / LONDON: The besieged territory of Gaza is slipping into famine, UN aid agencies warned on Tuesday, as the death toll from Israel’s nearly 22-month war surpassed 60,000.
The World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that time was running out and that Gaza was “on the brink of a full-scale famine”.
Meanwhile, the Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) air-drops will not be enough to avert the “humanitarian catastrophe”.
“The worst-case scenario of famine is now unfolding in the Gaza Strip,” said the IPC, a grouping of NGOs and institutions that serves as the world’s main monitor for gauging malnutrition, in a statement.
The IPC said its latest data shows that “famine thresholds” have been reached in most of Gaza and hunger-related deaths of young children were rising fast.
Although Israel launched daily pauses in its military operations in some parts of Gaza over the weekend, and opened secure routes to enable UN and other aid agencies to distribute food, Israeli strikes continued overnight, killing 30 people in the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Speaking in Geneva, the WFP’s emergency director Ross Smith said the humanitarian disaster was reminiscent of last century’s famines in Ethiopia and Nigeria’s Biafra region.
“This is unlike anything we have seen in this century,” he told reporters.
UK move towards recognition
Following an emergency meeting of his cabinet, UK PM Keir Starmer had announced that Britain would make the move unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two-state solution.
Starmer said his government would make an assessment in September on “how far the parties have met these steps”, but that no one would have a veto over the decision.
“I have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution,” he said in a Downing Street address.
France recently announced it would formally recognise the state of Palestine in September, and the UK would become the second permanent member of the UN Security Council to do so, if it goes ahead with the recognition.
UN conference
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has termed the Israel-Palestine question a “test case” for the world, particularly the United Nations, and sought “credible and enforceable international action”.
His call came during the three-day conference on ‘The peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution’, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia.
In his remarks, Deputy PM Dar told the conference, “The Palestinian question is a test case for the United Nations and the world. Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
During his speech, Mr Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the state of Palestine and its full UN membership”.
He said, “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters… Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism.
“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now. It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region.”
On the sidelines of the conference, Mr Dar met Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territory.
He also met Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya, expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”.

The remarks came from Justice Ayesha A. Malik , who was a member of the two-judge bench alongside Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, which decided the Sindh government’s appeal against a Feb 27 decision of the Sindh High Court (SHC) Circuit Bench Larkana.
The case was brought by Sorath Fatima, whose father was an employee of the Road and Transport Department, Sindh.
He died in February 2002 and his pension was awarded to his widow — Ms Fatima’s mother — who also died in December 2012.
Ms Fatima, being an unmarried daughter, sought the pension of her father, which she received until she married.
However, when Ms Fatima’s marriage ended in August 2022, she sought the resumption of her father’s pension on the grounds that being a divorced daughter, she was entitled to it.
The Sindh government denied her application, and Ms Fatima challenged the decision before the SHC, which ruled in her favour. The Sindh government then appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court.
 
 

In the 10-page judgment, Justice Malik expressed the concern that a daughter’s entitlment to pension depended entirely on her marital status.
“This dependency model reveals that there is a systematic bias that treats a daughter as a dependent, with her financial dependency shifting from parent to spouse,” the judgment added.
This assumption not only perpetuated “stereotypical mindset about women being dependent members” but also fails to recognise women as individuals or “autonomous individuals” who can be financially independent.
It is also based in the “flawed belief” that unmarried or divorced women are financially dependent, while married women are financially secure, the judgment highlighted.
Justice Malik said pension was an “earned right” passed onto the legal heirs of a deceased government servant.
Justice Malik emphasised the need to revisit pension law and remove marital status as a condition for entitlement.

“US President Mr Trump has said that he got the war between Pakistan and India stopped. There is no achievement bigger than this diplomatic achievement,” PM Shehbaz said while speaking at a gathering after inaugurating the upgraded Pak Business Express and newly introduced passenger facilities at Lahore railway station.
“We are streamlining our relations with the United States,” he added.
On Pakistan’s relations with China, PM Shehbaz said work was underway on the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “We are in full coordination with China on the CPEC-2,” he said.

Lauds railways for upgrading dining facilities and other services like Wi-Fi

He also highlighted improvements in Pakistan’s economic performance, including a drop in inflation from 38pc to 5pc and a reduction in the policy rate to 11pc.
Railway ‘progress’
In his address, the prime minister acknowledged the deterioration of Pakistan’s railway system, once considered a model for public transport. “The railway system in Pakistan was once the best, but unfortunately, it faced destruction,” he said, adding that he had appointed Hanif Abbasi as Minister for Railways to address these issues.
 
 

PM Shehbaz applauded the railways for upgrading its passenger services, including the introduction of Wi-Fi, escalators, modern dining rooms and clean washrooms, as well as the ending of obsolete ticket checking and purchasing systems. He stressed the need for further digitisation to meet future goals.
He asked Mr Abbasi to revive international freight services through goods train operations and commended the improvements in cleanliness and the provision of ATMs at railway stations.
Mr Abbasi, in his address, discussed ongoing developments in the railway sector, including digitisation, new coaches and the expansion of online ticketing services. He stressed that the railways had earned Rs93 billion in revenue during the 2024-25 fiscal year, with support from provincial governments for infrastructure improvements.
Kyrgyzstan ties
PM Shehbaz on Tuesday also met with a high-level delegation from Kyrgyzstan, led by Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov, to discuss bilateral cooperation.
The delegation is in Pakistan for the 5th Session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Joint Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across multiple sectors, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
 
 

The premier welcomed the delegation and praised the successful convening of the IGC session. He appreciated the signing of several memoranda of understanding (MoUs), which he believed would enhance trade, energy cooperation, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges between the two nations.
SCO visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz is expected to head to China today (Wednesday) to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, PM Office sources said.
He is expected to hold bilateral meetings with Chinese leadership during the visit and will also meet world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The PM has convened the federal cabinet’s meeting today (Wednesday).

• Omar Ayub complains to CJP about ‘procedural violations’ in May 9 trials
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of a set of challenges instituted by PTI founder Imran Khan over being denied post-arrest bail by the Lahore High Court (LHC) in eight cases related to the May 9 violence.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the two-judge bench took up the matter on Tuesday, but adjourned proceedings until Aug 12, although PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja informed the bench that senior counsel Sal­man Safdar, who had filed the app­eals, had requested an adjournment until next week.
Mr Raja also asked the bench to issue notices to the respondent, mainly the state, through Punjab’s prosecutor general. However, the court adjourned the case for Aug 12, ignoring both requests to push the hearing date to next week and for the issuance of notices to the respondents.
In his plea, Imran Khan had argued that contrary to the prosecution’s accusations that he orchestrated the May 9 violence, he was held incommunicado in NAB custody at the time of the alleged offence.
Therefore, his involvement in the May 9 riots was impossible, Mr Khan argued, also reminding that the Supreme Court had already held that the case of an abettor who was not present at the scene of occurrence stands on a lower legal footing than that of a principal accused.
On Nov 27, 2024, an anti-terrorism court had denied Mr Khan bail in the eight cases, which include the Lahore attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty Chowk, PML-N offices in Model Town, the Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge. The LHC later rejected Mr Khan’s bail plea as well.
The fresh appeal contended that the PTI founder had been allegedly subjected to an unprecedented campaign of political victimisation since his ouster from the office of the prime minister two years ago.
Omar Ayub writes to CJP
Separately, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan has written to CJP Yahya Afridi, raising concerns over procedural violations in the ongoing trials related to the events of May 9.
In his letter, Mr Ayub urged the CJP to initiate a judicial inquiry into allegations of misconduct by police and prosecutors and to reopen concluded trials.
“This letter is a solemn appeal on behalf of myself, my party, and the many Pakistani citizens who have been caught up in the web of rushed and unfair May 9 trials currently being conducted in multiple cities,” Mr Ayub wrote.
“The Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs) in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sargodha, and other cities are hearing cases related to May 9 with a speed and manner that shocks the conscience of any impartial observer”.
“Hearings commence early morning and extend late into the night; in fact, it is reliably reported that in some cases, proceedings continue until 2am to 3am. This is neither justice delayed nor justice served — this is justice crushed and justice buried under the weight of exhaustion, coercion and haste.”
Mr Ayub also accused the authorities of using the trials for political persecution, alleging that police reports and prosecutions lacked credible evidence and were marked by procedural irregularities.
While claiming that media access to these trials has been severely restricted, he said: “The courts must stand as bulwarks against tyranny, and when constitutional rights are trampled, it is their duty to restore justice and equity.”

Some of them returned to the country during Muha­­rram, others had fled the Iran-Israel war a month ago; and nearly all of them possess valid travel documents issued by the Iranian government. But the border crossing, located almost 70km from the port city of Gwadar, has remained closed since the Iran-Israel conflict broke out.
The stranded individuals have been staying in hotels and other lodgings, while immigration officials await ‘fresh orders’ to process their exit. The recent bar on travelling to Iraq and Iran by road has only complicated matters.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), posted at the Gabd border, said the students had valid travel documents, but they could not be allowed to cross, as the border was still closed.
“No fresh order has been issued by the Pakistani authorities concerned for opening the border with Iran (after the war ended),” FIA Deputy Director Asif Naseem told Dawn.
He said that in addition to the earlier closure, a recent decision by the government to ban road travel during Chehlum had also imposed restrictions on such travel. The FIA official said the students could travel to their destination by air.
Last week, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued guidelines for pilgrims, saying the land entry would be subject to the approval of the Pakistani government. A day later, the government said no such travel would be allowed on account of security concerns.
However, it did not specify if the ban pertained to the Chehlum pilgrims or applied to all travellers entering Iran. In any case, land crossings with Iran haven’t re-opened since the war.
 
 

“More than 50 students, some with families, are stuck at the Gabad border, while hundreds more are waiting in Karachi and other towns, as Pakistani immigration officials claim they have received no instructions to process their exit,” said Maulana Ali Anwar, brother of one of the stranded students.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Anwar, who is also a Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM) office-bearer, said his brother was stuck at Gabad. He added that many other students had been staying in Karachi and other cities after receiving the news about the stranded students.
According to Mr Anwar, the students, having Iqama, return to their native areas every year during the Muharram holidays and start returning to Iran in the Islamic month of Safar.
‘Arrangements being made’
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told Dawn that arrangements were being made to facilitate “some 30 to 40 students” stranded at the Pak-Iran border. Jus­tifying the ban concerning land pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq, he claimed it was meant to facilitate Zaireen.
According to the minister, the government will introduce fundamental changes by August 31 to regulate pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq on the pattern of Haj and Umrah.
Asked to comment on fears that the ‘tour operator mafia’ would be the ultimate beneficiary of this policy, he said hundreds of operators would be registered under an open and transparent policy, noting that healthy competition would benefit the pilgrims. “It is a successful model in many parts of the world,” he remarked.
He said Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq were in the process of formulating a joint strategy to facilitate pilgrims, adding that the interior secretary would soon pay a visit to the two countries for follow-up meetings with the relevant authorities. He also revealed that a ship service for pilgrims was being mulled.

A day earlier, representatives from the State Bank of Pakistan, finance min­istry, commercial banks and exchange companies met with senior security officials to discuss steps to bring down the dollar price, stabilise the exch­ange rate and stop the smuggling of US currency to Afghanistan and Iran.
Another meeting, held on Tuesday, was dominated by the crypto agenda and saw Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) CEO Bilal Bin Saqib gave a presentation on the usage of virtual currencies in Pakistan.
In May, Mr Saqib was appointed the PM’s special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.
“We were told that the cryptos are the future currency for the changed economic world,” said a banker, on condition of anonymity.
 
 

He said the presentation and subsequent Q&A on crypto took “80 per cent time” of the meeting held on Tuesday.
Participants of the meeting Dawn spoke to said it seemed like the government was in hurry to make use of cryptocurrencies on a large scale and make them part of the economy as soon as possible.
Some have raised questions about the high-level of risk involved, but Mr Saqib played down the speculative risks.
Although cryptocurrencies have been in vogue for years, most central banks around the world have steered clear of any attempts to regulate them.
On July 9, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed had said that they were preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency, and were finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets.
 
 

The SBP and Finance Division are currently engaged with the Pakistan Crypto Council to develop an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets.
“Risks are still high, since the prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate with wide margin, like Bitcoin prices could jump from $35,000 to to $70,000,” a financial expert said.
However, he claimed that both the SBP and the government were ready for crypto transactions.
On Tuesday, banks, foreign exchange companies and gold traders were briefed on the benefit of such currencies.
Participants of the meeting were told that the central bank would issue licenses for crypto trading banks and other financial institutions. One banker hinted at the possibility of opening field offices in major cities to make virtual assets easily accessible and promote virtual transactions.

• Chitral MNA decries conviction based on ‘political vendetta’
• Gohar warns commission to stick to Constitution
• ECP official says appeals process remains open
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday disqualified Abdul Latif, a PTI MNA from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions have been taken in recent days.
The move comes just a day after three other PTI lawmakers were disqualified, including a senator and the leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
In a notification, the ECP said that under its July 29 order, Mr Latif was disqualified in accordance with Article 63(1h) of the Constitution. His seat in the National Assembly has become vacant following the disqualification.
In May, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad sentenced Mr Latif and four others to 27 years in prison for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, attack on the Ramna police station. The verdict was announced by ATC Special Court-II Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, who found the accused guilty of arson, violence and attacking law enforcement personnel during the riots.
Earlier on Tuesday, a five-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard a reference, a representation and a complaint to de-seat Chitrali on the basis of Anti-Terrorism Court verdict of May 30, 2025. The bench reserved judgement, which was placed on its website after office hours.
“Deriving wisdom from the referred judgement wherein it has been held that “where there is a conviction recorded by a competent court against a person who is a member of the Parliament which has attained finality, the role and function of the Election Commission is confined to issuing notification of disqualification of the concerned member on the basis of the verdict of the Court,” it reads.
Despite his conviction, a firebrand Mr Latif denied the charges, claiming he was wrongfully convicted in retaliation for refusing a Rs2 billion bribe to support the “controversial” 26th Constitutional Amendment. Mr Latif described the conviction as politically motivated, calling it an act of vengeance.
‘Democracy at stake’
PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed concerns over the disqualification of PTI lawmakers, warning that “democracy is at stake”.
Talking to a private TV channel, he acknowledged the growing concerns regarding the way political trials have been conducted, hinting that the situation had been clear from the beginning.
“We could see the writing on the wall,” he added.
The PTI leader also asked the ECP to refrain from justifying its actions and instead “follow the Constitution and the law”.
Appeals ‘open’
When asked for comment, a senior ECP official clarified that under the Constitution, a parliamentarian stood disqualified from office following a conviction.
The official explained that while the right to appeal remains intact even after disqualification, the disqualified member’s seat remains vacant until a court ruling overturns the conviction.
The official noted that if a member receives interim relief from a high court, which suspends the sentence, the disqualification remains in place. However, should higher courts overturn the conviction, the ECP would restore the individual’s victory notification.

A notification has been issued by the Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department, enforcing Section 5 and 7 of the Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health Ordinance, 2002. 
The new policy prohibits smoking, use of e-cigarettes, vapes and all tobacco-related products in the parks. It also bans the sale of such items at tuck shops, cafes and vending points within or around the public parks. 
According to the notification, visible ‘No Smoking’ signboards will be installed throughout the parks and designated staff will actively monitor compliance. All Parks and Horticulture Authorities (PHAs) have been instructed to fully implement the law within 10 days. 
“Since the litter from cigarette butts and packaging pollutes the environment and harms the aesthetic appeal of green spaces, this decision is a forward-thinking step to ensure clean surroundings and protect public health especially the youth,” said Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal said during his to the Lawrence Gardens along with the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) Director General Mansoor Ahmad.  
“The move reflects the Punjab government’s broader commitment to sustainability, community well-being, and the intelligent use of public resources, reinforcing the province’s goal of modernising urban life while preserving public health,” he added. 
Under the decision, all public parks across the province have officially been declared no-smoking zones. 
The secretary inspected various parts of the Lawrence Gardens and emphasized the need to preserve and highlight the park’s historic identity. 
He directed that all the laws and regulations must be strictly enforced in public gardens and parks to ensure a peaceful and healthy environment for families and fitness enthusiasts. 
However, it has not been announced how the ban would be implemented and what would happen in case of violation. 
When France recently imposed a nationwide ban on smoking in parks and on beaches, it came with a clear rule of 90 euros fine on the violators and in case of nonpayment of fine within 15 days, the fine would go up to 135 euros. 
According to the Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health Ordinance, 2002, a violator may face a fine from Rs1,000 to Rs100,000, depending on severity and frequency of the violation.

Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq confirmed the development to Dawn.com.
A notification in this regard issued by Bajaur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Shahid Ali Khan said there was a need to impose restrictions on all kinds of movement on the main roads and outside houses at Badi Siah, Tarkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanata and Zagai area of Tehsil Loe Mamund to prevent any untoward incidents as recommended by the Bajaur District Intelligence Coordination Committee to ensure public safety during targeted actions against militants.
The DC imposed a ban on all kinds of movement of individuals outside houses, on roads, vehicles and all forms of traffic on all roads at the above villages with effect from 5am today till 5pm on July 31 (Thursday) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
It instructed all individuals to comply with the order and restrict all movement on the roads and outside houses, warning that anyone found violating the order would be liable for legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Awami National Party President Aimal Wali Khan alleged that innocent people were injured in the operation and called on the violence to stop.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl also said that it could not support the operation.
The decision came following the police repulsing an attack by terrorists on Thangi checkpost on Sunday night. Officials had told Dawn that terrorists attacked the joint police and FC post in Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday night around 9:42 pm. They said that police and security forces personnel at the post responded effectively to the attack.
They said that no casualties were reported in the attack. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Police on Monday started checking suspicious vehicles and people to thwart terrorist activities in the district. Several police officials took part in the exercise, searching vehicles and people on roads and exit and entry points, said a statement.
On July 10, Awami National Party politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in the district.
An assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in the district’s Sadiqabad area on July 2.</p><small>2025-07-29 18:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616381-conventional-warfare-supremacy-over-india-shattered-nuclear-deterrence-myth-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Conventional warfare supremacy over India shattered nuclear deterrence myth: PM</strong></a><br><p>
