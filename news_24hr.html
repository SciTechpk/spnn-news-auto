A delegation of top businessmen, led by Gohar Ijaz and including Atif Ikram Sheikh, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), met with the army chief at the General Headquarters (GHQ) on Monday.
According to a statement issued by the FPCCI, the delegation presented a detailed overview of the challenges facing the industrial sector, particularly concerns over the recently expanded powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Special emphasis was placed on the controversial provisions under Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act 1990, which allow for arrest and detention.
 
 

The FPCCI president said the business community was grateful to the army chief for directing that the enforcement of these provisions be held in abeyance. He also underscored the need for a meaningful dialogue between the FBR and business stakeholders to resolve ongoing disputes and rebuild trust.
The statement noted that GHQ, through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), would continue to support economic activities and foster an environment of collaboration. The delegation praised the government and SIFC for their efforts, which have brought a measure of stability to the economy.

Business leaders meet army chief, seek relief on taxes, energy, interest rates

The FPCCI chief also urged for a reduction in interest rates in line with inflation to support business growth. He highlighted delays in notifying amendments to the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), particularly the exclusion of cotton, yarn, and greige fabric from the scheme, and the imposition of an 18pc sales tax on their imports.
He further drew attention to high electricity prices, which continue to weigh heavily on manufacturers and exporters. The FPCCI acknowledged the field marshal’s ongoing efforts to secure more competitive power tariffs, especially for industrial and export sectors.
The delegation assured the army chief of the business community’s unified commitment to reviving the economy. “Under Field Marshal Asim Munir’s guidance, we are confident Pakistan can unlock its full potential, restore investor confidence, and achieve inclusive economic growth,” the statement said.
Khalid Hasnain adds from Lahore: Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President termed the meeting impressive, as the army chief assured the delegation that there would be no issues for the business community.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi managed the meeting, which lasted for almost four hours after starting around 8pm on Monday night, the LCCI president maintained.

The prospect on all three counts today is extremely bleak, since there is no apparent interest among the ruling elites of either country in dialogue for the resolution of the core issues. As the smaller country, Pakistan should have more interest in reducing tensions. However, in the aftermath of the four-day conflict, there is even less interest in dialogue in both countries.
There is also little demand from opposition parties and public opinion in either country for dialogue. The question of immediate interest in both countries is whether a second round of hostilities is likely, and, if so, what outcomes may be anticipated. This is a horrendous state of affairs considering both countries are nuclear weapons powers that may or may not have the necessary control over the so-called escalation ladder, especially in a conflict that in a second round would expand beyond the border regions, and whose outcome may depend on unanticipated technological capabilities and battle strategies.
This alone should justify exploring all possibilities for productive dialogue. However, even among seasoned diplomats, the effort to rise above zero-sum exchanges is largely absent. This is because we have so completely internalised mutually exclusive and hostile narratives that the costs of continuing with the present unavailing situation seem far less than the political risks of seeking diplomatic breakthroughs.

This is a losing situation for both countries and for South Asia.

In a recent interview of a former Pakistani foreign minister by a prominent Indian journalist, the questions asked more or less exclusively reflected India’s narrative, and the answers given more or less exclusively reflected Pakistan’s narrative. Audiences in both countries were apparently satisfied, although no serious attempt was made to explore possibilities for productive dialogue.
So where can the two countries go from here? I have attempted to address this in language that might elicit a measure of support from both sides. This is a losing situation for both countries and for South Asia. The region faces enormous challenges, including avoiding the spectre of nuclear conflict; mitigating and overcoming the fatal consequences of irreversible climate change; the whole range of good governance, development, and human rights issues; transforming South Asia into a hub of global economic activity, etc. Accordingly, the whole region has a critical stake in the transformation of India-Pakistan relations and the revival of Saarc from its moribund state.
All of this is possible but perceptions and possibilities will need to change. India sees Pakistan as a ‘structurally’ failing state with which any longer-term engagement is more or less irrelevant. Pakistan sees India acting as a regional hegemon instead of a first among equals, and being frustrated by the strategic entry of China into South Asia as an effective counterforce to India, which China sees as a US proxy. Within this unpromising scenario, India and Pakistan, not without justification, see each other engaged in a range of mutually destabilising activities.
Accordingly, the challenge is to get political leaders, policymakers, policy advisers, the political intelligentsia, academics, journalists, teachers, ‘culture vultures’ including artists, poets and humorists, etc, to create a national realisation of our shared survival stake and, accordingly, the need to situate policies towards each other in that context on a priority basis. What are the chances of this happening? Close to zero at present because of the anti-people nature of their respective politics and their governing institutions. Unless, of course, the political intelligentsia of the two countries are intelligent and motivated enough to meet their national responsibilities and do something more than articulate admirable expressions of hope and goodwill.
There is a whole list of implemented, unimplemented, terminated and contemplated confidence-building measures that can be considered to initiate a process of normalisation. For such a process to be sustainable, however, it will be essential for both countries to take measures aimed at building a minimum of mutual trust to fuel the process of accommodation, compromise, and eventually, significant normalisation.
An exchange of visits by the prime ministers of India and Pakistan should be considered with the purpose of building mutual trust, addressing each other’s concerns despite disagreements, and delineating measures to build a path towards realising the vast potential for mutually beneficial cooperation over a range of fields. All this could help develop influential trans-border constituencies for a sustainable normalisation process. Bureaucrats, diplomats and others can critically assist such a process, but they cannot or will not bring about real change on their own.
The Indians with justification see Pakistan’s military as institutionally unwilling to allow a lasting breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations, as the prevailing hostility facilitates its control of Pakistan’s politics. With equal justification, Pakistanis see the BJP and Modi’s electoral winning strategy of Hindutva, hostility to Pakistan, repression and refusal to negotiate on Kashmir, and threats to divert the Indus waters as equally insuperable obstacles to normalisation.
There are people of goodwill from all walks of life in India and Pakistan who wish to see the mutually debilitating hostility between India and Pakistan a thing of the past. But while many of them are highly respected, they do not add up to a political force that can bring about change. What is required are political movements, not to bring about improved India-Pakistan relations as such, but for democratic, people-based governance and equitable development in both countries. This would help rationalise their national policies and eliminate blind spots in the India-Pakistan relationship which serve the interests of exploitative and obstructive elites in both countries.
Finally, an India-Pakistan normalisation process should in no way hinder the further deepening of Pakistan’s relations with China, which does not see itself as an enemy or rival of India as long as the latter does not ally itself with the US against China. Involving the US or the Gulf countries in India-Pakistan relations would be thoroughly counterproductive.

The statement — cautious and diplomatic — labels it a “war” but to call it that is to obscure the truth. This is not a conventional war between two sides. It is genocide, conducted by one of the world’s most heavily armed militaries, against an imprisoned, starved and decimated civilian population that has nowhere left to run. In the 21 months of Israel’s relentless bombardment, the destruction in Gaza defies imagination.
More than 59,000 Palestinians have been slaughtered. Homes, schools, hospitals, mosques — everything that sustains civilian life — have been razed. The UN reports that almost 900 people have been killed simply while seeking food, as hunger and famine spread across the enclave. In Deir al-Balah, where Israeli tanks pushed into new districts this week, already displaced residents once more face death and homelessness. This is not some war for ‘security’, it is the systematic destruction of a people.
The statement rightly condemns Israel’s “drip feeding of aid”, the inhumane killing of civilians seeking food and water, and the violation of international law through proposed forced displacement of Palestinians. It also expresses “strong opposition” to Israeli settlement expansions in the West Bank, including the E1 settlement plan that would sever Palestinian territories and sabotage the two-state solution. Settler violence, too, is called out. Yet for all this, the statement stops short of calling a spade a spade.
Even the pledge by these nations to take “further action to support an immediate ceasefire” is inadequate in view of what the situation demands. The world does not need more ambiguous warnings or empty statements — it needs accountability. Instead of shielding Israel with euphemisms, the West must demand an immediate halt to this bloodshed, coupled with sanctions, international investigations, and prosecutions for war crimes.
There is bitter irony in Israel’s role as the perpetrator of such violence. One would think that a state that came into being following the Holocaust — history’s most harrowing genocide — would internalise and live by the crucial lesson: never again, for anyone. And yet, instead of choosing peace, it has embraced perpetual violence, while much of the world watches in complicit silence.
The world must reject this moral abdication before more lives are lost. If there is to be any hope of peace, the bloodshed must stop — not with empty statements, but with decisive international action. A world that tiptoes around genocide is a world where no people, anywhere, can claim the protection of humanity.

The report simply reflects how the affairs of the government in the country’s biggest and most powerful province have virtually become a family enterprise.
There is nothing new about the dynastic stranglehold on Pakistani politics. But the kind of family rule that prevails in Punjab tells the story of an increasingly regressive power structure. Apparently, not only are decisions on important policy matters taken during family meetings, there is also a government-sponsored move to build a personality cult around former prime minister and head of the Sharif family Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz, Punjab’s chief minister.
It seems that most major government development projects in the province are named after either of the two. There has also been a move to rename some of the old government-run projects after the chief minister. Meanwhile, the provincial government has been running massive ad campaigns praising its own performance in various spheres, with life-sized pictures of the chief minister. Many also carry the image of her father.
This publicity drive is apparently being carried out at government expense. Recently, posters referring to the chief minister as ‘Madr-i-Millat’ (mother of the nation) appeared in the province. This campaign may not be sponsored by the provincial government but has certainly been orchestrated by the ruling party. Even with dynastic politics being the name of the game in Pakistan, rarely has the country witnessed this scale of personal glorification. Such campaigns are only seen in authoritarian regimes which lack legitimacy. But these publicity measures are short-lived and cannot serve the objective. Legitimacy and popularity cannot be won on the back of state-sponsored publicity drives. This kind of personalised publicity drive, paid for by the people’s tax money, is beyond narcissism and has clear political aims. In fact, placing personal photographs in government-sponsored ads and naming projects that use state funds after a sitting government head is seen as illegal in many countries.

The Sharifs’ personalised publicity seen in Punjab has clear political aims.

Even in Pakistan, a Supreme Court ruling in 2022, quoted by Naeem Sadiq on these pages, declared: “Paid servants of the state, constitutional office holders and politicians in government must not use their positions for personal, partisan or pecuniary gain”. It further noted: “Pakistan is not a kingdom, principality or fiefdom in which the people are to be beholden to their rulers.”
It seems that the country has actually been turned into a fiefdom where there is no respect for rules or moral values. Self-glorification of the ruling family, which returned to power with a questionable mandate, makes a mockery of the democratic process. Power is concentrated in the hands of the prime minister and the chief minister of the biggest province — both belong to the Sharif family.
Could this have happened without the establishment’s support? This self-glorification campaign is not limited to civilians and extends to the military leadership. It seems that the entire image-building effort for the civilian and military leadership is part of a concerted plan to strengthen the existing hybrid power structure. Behind the civilian façade, the spectre of those wielding the real power looms large. The Sharif family appears content to play second fiddle. After all, the family owed its return to power to the backing of the powers that be.
More than anyone, the Sharif family should know the slippery slope of power politics. They have been on it many times in the past and were swept away by the fast-shifting sands of Pakistani politics. Yet the lure of power is so strong that they tend to forget their own example. They have readily become an instrument in the move to undermine democracy. Their own return to po­­wer is the result of a manipulated electoral process, which also explains the fragility of a fabricated power structure lacking popular mandate.
It was a remarkable turn of events that allowed the once-disgraced family to return to the corridors of power. Three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif was unceremoniously removed by the Supreme Court in 2017 and barred for life from holding public office through a controversial verdict the following year. He, along with his daughter and other members of the family, were convicted on multiple graft charges.
After being ousted from power, he and his party tried to mobilise public support on the back of the slogan ‘give respect to the vote’. But all the pro-democracy and anti-establishment rhetoric was set aside once a deal was struck. In less than four years after his exit, the PML-N was back in power, with Nawaz Sharif’s younger brother becoming prime minister in the new set-up formed after the removal of Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence in parliament made possible by behind-the-scenes elements.
But the elder Sharif waited for the announcement of the elections before returning to the country. In no time, his convictions were overturned by the courts and his disqualification was lifted. He was sure of his party sweeping the polls, so it must have come as a rude shock when the counting started. He lost in Mansehra and his victory in Lahore was questionable. His dream of becoming prime minister was dashed. But the establishment’s backing for his party was assured no matter what the real results were.
Most Sharif family members who were earlier convicted and suffered prison are now part of the power structure, although Nawaz Sharif has opted to stay in the background and lead the party. He seems happy with his daughter becoming the first woman chief minister of Punjab and with himself being glorified as a great leader and helmsman. The great champion of democracy does not seem to have any problem now when the sanctity of the vote is being crushed.

• 156 lawmakers remained absent without submitting leave applications
ISLAMABAD: Only 78 members of the National Assembly (MNAs) attended every sitting during the budget session last month, while 10 did not attend a single sitting, according to a new report released on Tuesday.
The budget session, which lasted 13 sittings from June 5 to 27, was frequently marred by poor attendance of MNAs, particularly from the treasury side, forcing lawmakers to point out the absence of government ministers.
The protest prompted the speaker to direct government members holding finance-related portfolios to attend the sessions.
Yet the finance minister, who is a senator, attended nine, or 69 per cent of sittings, according to a report released by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
The minister of state and parliamentary secretary for finance and revenue, both MNAs, were present in 11 or 85pc of sittings.
Notably, the economic affairs minister, also a senator, did not attend any sitting during the session, despite his portfolio being closely related to issues discussed during the budget session.
According to the report, 83pc of members in the 336-seat house were present on June 10 when the Finance Bill, 2025 was introduced.
However, as the discussion progressed into general topics, attendance declined, reaching its lowest point — 57pc — on the third sitting.
The attendance resurged again at 79pc on the final day of the discussion, which also included deliberations on Senate recommendations and charged expenditures.
A marked increase was observed towards the end of the session, with attendance rising above 9pc  during voting on demands for grants and the Finance Bill.
The highest attendance was 93pc, recorded on the day the Finance Bill was passed.
An analysis of the attendance and leave applications read during the proceedings showed 235 members, or 75pc of the current strength, missed at least one sitting during the budget session.
However, only 79 members submitted leave applications for their absence. Of them, 13 applied for leave in advance, while 46 submitted the application while on leave or after returning.
The leave applications of the remaining 20 lawmakers were read on a day falling in the middle of their period of absence.
As many as 46 members sought approval for the entire duration of their absence, while the remaining 36 were absent for longer than the number of days for which they had requested leave.
As many as 156 members remained absent without submitting any application during the session.
A total of 22 female MNAs, including 19 on reserved seats and three on general seats attended all sittings.
Meanwhile, all seven minority members attended more than half of the sittings, including three who attended all sittings.
Among male MNAs elected on general seats, 10 did not attend any sitting, 35 were present in less than half of the sittings and 208 attended more than half of the sittings. Meanwhile, 54 were present in every sitting.
Among the cabinet members, the federal ministers for parliamentary affairs and public affairs unit attended all sittings.
Likewise, the ministers of state for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, national food security & research, and religious affairs & interfaith harmony were present throughout the session.
The majority of lawmakers from PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole member of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan attended every sitting.
Lawmakers from the Balochistan Awami Party, National Party and the PML-Zia attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole representative of the PkMAP attended less than half of the sittings.

• WHO accuses IDF of storming its facilities
• EU foreign policy chief asks Israeli counterpart to stop killings at aid points
GENEVA: The United Nations (UN) on Tuesday said Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started operations.
An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking famine warnings.
GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.
“Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating,” UN human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told AFP.
“As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near UN and other humanitarian organisations’ aid convoys.” Kheetan added: “Our data is based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organisations.”
Malnutrition claims lives
Meanwhile, the head of Gaza’s largest hospital on Tuesday said 21 children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in the Palestinian territory in the past three days, while Israel pressed a devastating assault.
Gaza’s population of more than two million people is facing severe shortages of food and other essentials, with residents frequently killed as they try to collect humanitarian aid at a handful of distribution points.
“Twenty-one children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in various areas across the Gaza Strip,” Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza, told reporters.
Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza’s remaining functioning hospitals “every moment”.
“We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza,” he added.
‘Horror show’
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Gaza a “horror show” in a speech on Tuesday, with “a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times”.
Chaotic scenes have become frequent at aid distribution areas since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began overseeing aid operations.
Latest attacks
Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 81 Palestinians, including 31 aid seekers, in attacks across Gaza since dawn, a day after tanks pushed into southern and eastern parts of Deir el-Balah for the first time, according to an Al-Jazeera report.
Also, the World Health Orga­nisation said Israel attacked its facilities amid its expanding ground operations. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that Israeli strikes on the Al-Shati camp west of Gaza City had killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 50.
He said two people were killed in Deir el-Balah.
The UN agency’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused troops of entering its staff residence, and forcing women and children to evacuate, as they handcuffed, stripped and interrogated male staff at gunpoint.
‘Morally unacceptable’
Reports of the latest death toll came as the Roman Catholic church’s most senior cleric in the Holy Land said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “morally unacceptable”.
“We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of a simple meal,” Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa told a news conference in Jerusalem after visiting Gaza.
Civilian killings ‘must stop’
In the meantime, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told her Israeli counterpart Tuesday that Israel’s military “must stop” killing civilians at aid distribution points in Gaza.
Kallas wrote on X that “the killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible”.
“I spoke again with Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF must stop killing people at distribution points,” she wrote.

• Shah Mehmood Qureshi among six acquitted in Sherpao Bridge case
• PTI leadership vows to move high court against ‘unjust’ decisions
• Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated by acting Punjab Assembly speaker
LAHORE: Several PTI leaders were handed down decade-long sentences by two anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha in connection with cases registered in the aftermath of the May 9, 2023, violence that had engulfed the country following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in a corruption case.
In Lahore, ATC Judge Arshad Javed announced the decision in Kot Lakhpat Jail around 9:30pm in the presence of the incarcerated PTI leaders, who were implicated in the Sherpao Bridge case.
The court awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid. Besides four senior leaders of the PTI, the judge sentenced as many accused to 10-year rigorous imprisonment, including Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Ali Hassan, Khalid Qayum and Riaz Hussain.
The court, however, acquitted PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi. This is the first verdict in any of the cases related to the May 9 riots in Lahore. The judge acquitted six accused, including Mr Qureshi, who, as per his defence, was in Karachi on the day of the alleged occurrence. PTI activists Hamza Azeem, Aitzaz Rafiq, Rana Tanvir, Iftikhar Ahmad, and Zayas Khan were also acquitted.
In this case, as many as 14 accused were indicted during the trial conducted in the jail for security reasons. The prosecution had submitted the challan (charge-sheet) on Sept 28, 2023.
In its final arguments, the prosecution had argued that the ‘May 9 conspiracy’ was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park, the residence of Imran Khan.
 
 

Advocate Burhan Moazzam
Malik, the lead defence counsel, argued that the FIR mentioned 400 accused persons, but only 14 were being put on trial. The lawyer also pointed out that no medical certificate existed to prove that any person was injured on May 9. He said the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the PTI leaders at the place of alleged occurrence.
About Mr Qureshi, he said the former foreign minister was in Karachi on May 9, 2023. The Sarwar Road police registered the FIR, claiming that the accused delivered provocative speeches and incited rioting, attacks and public disorder at Sherpao Bridge during the widespread violent protests of May 9.
Sargodha ATC
Meanwhile, the Sargodha ATC awarded ten-year rigorous imprisonment each to dozens of PTI leaders, including Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.
ATC Judge Naeem Sheikh convicted as many as 32 accused, including sitting MNA Ahmad Chattha and former MNA Rana Bilal Ijaz. In this case, over 70 accused persons, including National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan, had been declared proclaimed offenders.
Over a dozen accused were granted exemption from personal appearance during the trial proceedings. The prosecution presented testimonies of 50 witnesses to prove charges of attacks, vandalism, and incitement to violence against the accused.
The PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
‘Unlawful, unjust’
Commenting on the conviction, Mr Ayub said the decision by the Sargodha court was unlawful. In a statement on his X account, he said the same prosecution witnesses were declared untrustworthy by the previous trial judge. He said the PTI leaders had been convicted unjustly. He said the PTI leaders will challenge the conviction before the higher courts.
 






Mr Bhachar also announced he would challenge the ATC verdict in the Lahore High Court. “Once the written verdict is received, I will approach the Lahore High Court,” he added.
Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated
Separately, Punjab Assembly acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar on Tuesday reinstated 26 opposition PTI members who had been suspended for 15 sittings for disrupting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
During the session, Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman addressed the house and conveyed Chief Minister Maryam’s desire for the return of the suspended members. “These representatives have been elected by the people and have come to the assembly,” the minister said, adding, “I request the speaker to allow them back into the house so they can represent their constituencies.”
He emphasised the importance of the opposition’s presence, remarking, “The assembly lacks vibrancy without the opposition. The reinstatement of the 26 suspended members will enable them to represent their constituencies effectively. Frankly, I don’t enjoy the proceedings as much without the opposition.”
Earlier, Speaker Malik Muhammad Khan had rejected references against the 26 opposition MPAs seeking their disqualification on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the killing of nine bus passengers from Punjab while they were travelling in Balochistan on July 10.

According to the Indian Express, the fleet is scheduled to be retired in Septe­mber after serving the IAF for six decades. Inducted in 1963, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were number-plated or retired from service between 2017 and 2024, the newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources in the military.
Its sources said the IAF is set to retire the remaining Russian-origin MiG-21 fleet in a ceremonial decom­m­issioning at Chan­digarh airbase on Sept 19.
Two squadrons of MiG-21 Bisons are currently active.
India procured more than 700 MiG-21 aircraft of different variants, such as the Type-77, Type-96, BIS and the Bison, since the aircraft’s induction in the IAF in 1963.
The phasing out of the aging MiG-21 fleet was originally scheduled to be concluded by 2022, but was held up due to a delay in the planned induction of other fighter jets, including the indig­enous Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, which are set to replace the MiG-21 squadrons.
Four squadrons phased out
Between 2017 and 2024, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were phased out. India has a sanctioned fighter squadron strength of 42, but has 31 active squadrons.
The phasing out of the MiG-21 fleet will further bring down the IAF’s active fighter squadrons.
The MiG-21 Bison, which comprises the last two squadrons to be retired, is one of India’s six fighter jets.
The single engine, single-seater multi-role fighter/ground attack aircraft has been a key fighter jet with the IAF. The Bison is the latest upgrade of the MiG-21 jets.
 
 

Over 100 MiG-21s of the IAF have been upgraded to Bison over the last three decades.
The MiG-21 Bison upgrades included avionics and communication systems, electronics, multi-function display cockpits, the Kopyo light-weight multi-mode radar, radio sets, electronic warfare suite, inertial navigation system/GPS, a helmet-mounted display and a better windshield, among others. However, the engine performance and load carrying capacity of the jet could not be enhanced as part of the upgrades, with its airframe being the major limitation, the Express said.
With a maximum speed of 2,230 kilometres per hour, the jet carries one 23mm twin-barrel cannon with four R-60 close combat missiles. Initially developed as an interceptor, the supersonic jet was eventually upgraded to perform as a multi-role combat aircraft, including ground attacks.
Despite its significant role in all wars and conflicts fought by India, the MiG-21 jets had earned a mixed reputation due to several crashes, although it could have happened due to a multitude of reasons.
Some estimates say that India lost over 400 MiG-21 jets, including its variants and trainer versions, since its induction, and the crashes killed over 100 pilots and some civilians.
A MiG-21 fighter jet of the IAF crashed near Rajasthan’s Suratgarh in May 2023 while it was on a routine operational training sortie, killing three civilians. In July 2022, a MiG-21 trainer Type 69 aircraft crashed, killing Wing Commander M. Rana and Flight Lieutenant Adivitiya Bal.

• Orders special audit of IPP payments, sectoral inefficiencies
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday conducted a detailed review of audit objections related to the Ministry of Energy, with a focus on independent power producers (IPPs), rising electricity costs, incomplete development schemes and excessive load-shedding.
Officials from the Central Power Purch­asing Agency (CPPA-G) briefed the committee on a sharp rise in the installed capacity of IPPs from 9,765MW in 2015 to 25,642MW in 2024.
They revealed that the annual capacity purchase price had surged from Rs141 billion in 2015 to a staggering Rs1.4 trillion by 2024. In contrast, power generation dropped from 90bn kilowatt-hours in 2014 to 58bn in 2015.
Chaired by MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, the committee questioned the rationale behind these increases. PPP’s Naveed Qamar challenged the power division’s justification of rising coal prices.
Mr Akbar expressed disbelief at claims of up to 200 per cent power generation efficiency from sugarcane bagasse, while CPPA-G officials clarified that the actual output had surpassed their benchmark estimate of 45pc.
The committee also raised concerns about inefficiencies at certain power plants. Riaz Fatyana criticised the closure of staff positions at the Balloki-based Bhikki plant, questioning why salaries were still being paid despite a lack of production.
He also questioned the decision to establish the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant in a region without coal deposits, suggesting the Kalabagh hydropower project as a more logical alternative.
 
 

Senator Mohsin Aziz inquired about the actual costs of these power plants, while Junaid Akbar sought to know why surplus electricity was not being directed towards industrial and agricultural sectors.
Another critical issue raised was the electricity billing structure. The committee discussed the financial burden placed on consumers using even slightly more than 200 units of electricity. “Even if usage crosses 200 units once, the consumer ends up paying higher bills for six months,” Mr Akbar said.
Power Secretary Dr Muhammad Fakhre Alam Irfan confirmed that 58pc of consumers fell in this category and acknowledged the dilemma of subsidy requirements if the limit was raised. He added that the government was working on shifting to a direct subsidy model using BISP data, aiming to phase out the existing system by 2027.
MNA Shazia Marri slammed the power division over prolonged power outages in her constituency, reporting 15 to 16 hours of loadshedding. She questioned the lack of transparency and poor sector management.
Dr Irfan attributed the high losses to technical issues and reiterated that policy decisions were subject to IMF conditionalities, requiring prior approval.
 
 

The PAC referred the IPPs-related issues to a subcommittee and directed a special audit.
In another session, the committee took up complaints over incomplete electricity schemes. MNA Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel revealed that Rs310 million was released to the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) in 2021 for a new scheme in his constituency, which remained unfinished.
MNAs Aamir Dogar and Khawaja Shiraz Mehmood highlighted discrepancies in the reported number of schemes in the Multan Electric Power Company, demanding a special audit to uncover the truth.
“This is a ruthless system,” said Khawaja Shiraz, who also accused officials of enabling transformer theft and manipulating the system.
“The power sector alone is enough to ruin the country,” he said.

According to eyewitnesses and local sources, 10 to 15 people were still missing, and a search operation was underway to find them.
Tourists stranded in Deosai due to the blocking of the Skardu-Deosai road have also been rescued.
 
 

Monsoon death toll
The monsoon rains, battering the country since late June, have resulted in widespread devastation.
According to NDMA, 234 people have lost their lives and 596 injured. Moreover, 826 houses have been damaged while 203 livestock killed since June 26.
Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 children.
The highest number of casualties was reported from Punjab, where 135 people lost their lives. In KP, 56 people were killed; Sindh recorded 24 fatalities; and Balochistan 16.
Two fatalities have been reported from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, while one child has been killed in Islamabad. No loss of life has been reported so far from Gilgit-Baltistan, according to NDMA.
Two fatalities have been reported in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, involving one man and one child. In Islamabad, one child was killed due to heavy rain and flooding.
Glof, flood forecast
In Punjab, houses and standing crops in hundreds of villages have been inundated because of low-to-medium level flooding in various rivers.
The deluge in Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Indus rivers forced evacuations and displaced hundreds of people in riverine areas of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.
Over 20 villages in Jhang district have been inundated due to the rising water levels in the Jhelum River. The Sutlej river has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a fresh alert for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Separately, KP PDMA has also issued a Glof alert for Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower, Dir Upper, Swat and Kohistan Upper.
A PMD advisory issued on Tuesday said the ongoing rainfall spell is likely to continue and can affect KP and GB during the week.
The prevailing weather conditions will increase the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions of GB and KP.
The Met Office has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to protect human lives and property.
The NDMA has warned of landslides in northern regions in view of the forecast monsoon rains.
 
 

The authority has cautioned PDMAs, rescue services, local administration, armed forces and NGOs to prepare for possible emergency situations.
As per the projection, isolated rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamir, Ghanche, Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Haveli, Bagh, and Poonch areas of GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. A similar weather pattern is expected in Chitral, Dir, Kohistan and adjoining mountainous zones of KP.
The downpour will increase the risk of landslides, mudslides, rockfalls and ground subsidence in Kolai Palas, Lower Kohistan, Upper Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Jaglot, Nagar, Hunza, Rondu, Skardu and Chitral.
Relief operations
NDMA said it conducted 62 rescue operations across the country, rescuing 450 people stranded in flash floods during the monsoon season. The authority has established 27 relief and medical camps to serve the displaced population.
NDMA has also distributed 349 tents, 358 blankets, 500 sandbags, 266 quilts and sleeping bags, 76 mattresses, 554 kitchen sets and 305 mosquito nets.

Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told Dawn.com, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”
The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.
Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.
“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.
The incident comes two days after the police  arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’
The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.
Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, APP added.
The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure swift action against the culprits of the Degari incident and deliver appropriate punishment.
MPA Shahida Rauf decried the incident as barbaric and criticised unauthorised “Jirgas” for dispensing unlawful judgments, calling for tougher legislation and accountability.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti proposed forming a parliamentary committee to monitor the investigation and ensure transparency in the dual murder case.
Education Minister Rahila Hameed Durrani emphasised the psychological impact of the incident across society and noted that while it occurred before Eid, it only recently gained public attention after circulating online.
Adviser Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.
Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour. He strongly opposed vigilante justice.
MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.
She criticised unequal enforcement of law and challenged patriarchal norms surrounding honour.
Minister Haji Noor Muhammad Dummar called for decisive actions to prevent future tragedies, stating no one has the right to claim lives in the name of tradition.
The resolution was adopted unanimously after a thorough and impassioned debate.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615309-dr-yasmin-rashid-among-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-year-imprisonment-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid among PTI leaders sentenced to 10-year imprisonment in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan praised him as a person of “noble character” whose “political and national services” would be remembered for a long time.
 






Former Sindh governor and ex-PTI leader Imran Ismail said he was deeply saddened to hear of the death and praised the deceased as a “distinguished political figure”.

Left-arm Bangladesh pacer Shoriful Islam picked up his best T20I figures of 3-17 on a slow-paced Mirpur pitch as Pakistan lost their first five wickets for just 15 runs by the fifth over.
Ashraf cracked four sixes and as many boundaries to raise hopes of a comeback win, but spinner Rishad Hossain bowled him in the penultimate over.
Ashraf and Abbas Afridi, who scored a 13-ball 19, had revived the innings from 47-7 with a 41-run stand, but Bangladesh had the last laugh.
Bangladesh won the first match at the same venue by seven wickets and took an unassailable 2-0 lead with the final match on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
This was Bangladesh’s first T20I series win over Pakistan in four tries.
Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub to a run out for one in the first over before Islam dismissed Fakhar Zaman (8) and Mohammad Haris (0) to hit Pakistan hard at the top.
Bangladesh skipper Litton Das praised a team effort.
“It’s wonderful to win back-to-back series,” said Litton, who also led the team to a 2-1 T20I series in Sri Lanka last week. “This shows good improvement in our standards.”
Pakistan captain Salman Agha rued his side’s batting lapses.
“We thought 134 would be gettable but we lost too many wickets early on and that’s something we must address quickly,” said Agha.
Earlier, Jaker smashed five sixes and a boundary for his third T20I half century.
Bangladesh had lost four wickets for 28 by the sixth over before Jaker and Mahedi Hasan revived the innings with a 53-run stand for the fifth wicket.
Mahedi scored a 25-ball 33 with two sixes and as many boundaries.
The final match is on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
Last month, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh in a three-match home T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Das-led Bangladesh came into the series on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series triumph over Sri Lanka.
Pakistan are visiting Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.
This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as president of the UNSC for July.
The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on “Strengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” was a noteworthy development since it was an “important contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means”.
It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.
“The resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.
“Member states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”
The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.
“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”
 






Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.
It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.
He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.
FM Dar, UN chief call attention towards Gaza
Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”
He added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.
“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.
 






On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.
Dar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”
The Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”
 






UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.
Guterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.
“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.
Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.
He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.
“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.
“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.
“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.
Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.

The withdrawal from the Paris-based agency, which was founded after World War Two to promote peace through international cooperation in education, science, and culture, will take effect on December 31, 2026.
“President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco — which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said.
The State Department said remaining in Unesco was not in the national interest, accusing it of having “a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy”.
Unesco chief Audrey Azoulay said she deeply regretted Trump’s decision, but that it was “expected, and Unesco has prepared for it”.
The agency had diversified its sources of funding, receiving only about eight per cent of its budget from Washington, she said.
 






Unesco was one of several international bodies Trump withdrew from during his first term, along with the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement global climate change accord and the UN Human Rights Council. During his second term, he has largely reinstated those steps.
Unesco officials said the US withdrawal would have some limited impact on programmes the United States was financing.
Tensions?
Israel welcomed the US decision to quit Unesco.
The US State Department said one of the reasons for the withdrawal was Unesco’s decision to admit Palestine as a member state, which was “contrary to US policy and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organisation”.
Unesco officials said all relevant agency statements had been agreed with both Israel and the Palestinians over the past eight years.
“The reasons put forward by the United States to withdraw from the organisation are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and Unesco today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism,” Azoulay said.
“These claims also contradict the reality of Unesco’s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.”
 
 

Diplomats said it was felt at Unesco that the withdrawal was inevitable for political reasons, given that Biden had brought the US back and had promised to repay arrears from the first time Trump pulled out.
Unesco, whose full name is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, is best known for designating World Heritage Sites, including the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria.
The US initially joined Unesco at its founding in 1945 but withdrew for the first time in 1984 in protest against alleged financial mismanagement and perceived anti-US bias, returning in 2003 under then-president George W Bush, who said the agency had undertaken needed reforms.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/22185610f6d6709.jpg?r=185643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925874/qatar-bids-to-host-2036-olympic-games' target='_blank'><strong>Qatar bids to host 2036 Olympic Games</strong></a><br><p>Doha is bidding to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games, authorities said on Tuesday, as the wealthy Gulf state sets its sights on yet another major sport event to diversify its energy-reliant economy.
One of the smallest and wealthiest states in the Gulf, Qatar had already hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Should it be chosen, Qatar would become the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to host the Olympic Games, said Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani.
“The official bid submitted by the Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games represents a new milestone in Qatar’s journey,” he said in a statement shared on the official Qatar News Agency.
“The bid builds on Qatar’s proven track record of successfully hosting major international sporting events, most notably the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022,” Sheikh Mohammed added.
Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.
QOC President Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al-Thani said Doha had “made sport a central pillar of our national strategy”.
“We currently have 95 per cent of the required sports infrastructure in place to host the Games, and we have a comprehensive national plan to ensure 100pc readiness of all facilities,” he said.
Countries are no longer required to make their Olympic bids public. The Games are meant to rotate continents every season.
With the 2024, 2028, and 2032 editions set for Europe, North America, and Oceania, there are high chances the 2036 Olympic Games will be held in Asia — or in Africa, which would be a first.
Choosing the next host of the games will be the first major project for the International Olympic Committee’s new president, Kirsty Coventry, who last month became the first woman to lead the body.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615258-arms-liquor-case-court-adjourns-hearing-as-gandapur-assures-to-record-testimony' target='_blank'><strong>Arms, liquor case: Court adjourns hearing as Gandapur assures to record testimony</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in the district’s surrounding areas on Monday following a successful intelligence-based operation on Saturday in which four terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan, were killed.
“During the conduct of the operation, four more terrorists of Fitna al-Hindustan were hunted down and successfully neutralised.
“Terrorist hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered,” the ISPR said of the sanitisation operation.
It added that security forces remained determined to “thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan”.
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for eliminating the eight terrorists, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The president said that the security forces took out the enemies of the country with a display of bravery and professional capacity, adding that the nation was standing with its brave forces in the fight against terrorism.
“The terrorists want to sabotage the peace and stability in the country, which can never be allowed as the nation is united and the scourge of terrorism will be defeated at all costs,” he said.
The president also reiterated the resolve that the security forces would continue their operations till complete eradication of terrorism.
 






Similarly, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the nefarious designs of terrorists, who were inflicting harm upon the lives and properties of innocent civilians, would be foiled.
“The elements of Fitna al-Hindustan, who are enemies of the country’s solidarity, will be rooted out,” he said in a statement from the PM Office.
The prime minister further said that the government and security forces were committed to the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.
“Security forces, through timely action, thwarted the nefarious intentions of Indian-sponsored terrorists.
The nation views the operations of the security forces to eliminate India’s terrorist elements with appreciation.
“The exemplary end of Indian-sponsored terrorists is a clear message that there will be no place for this menace to hide in Pakistan. We will eliminate every single terrorist of the Indian menace from Pakistan,” he said.
 






The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
Furthermore, there has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Last week, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.
In April, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p><small>2025-07-22 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2217122936e05c7.png?r=171936' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925866/govt-says-punjab-assembly-opposition-leaders-10-year-sentence-in-may-9-riots-case-according-to-law' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says Punjab Assembly opposition leader’s 10-year sentence in May 9 riots case according to law</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday welcomed a Sargodha Anti-Terrorism Court’s (ATC) sentencing of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly (PA) Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to 10 years in prison over a case related to the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023, hailing it as a positive step.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan — who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
 
 

Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Today, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it … I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.”
He said the verdict “fulfils all requirements of justice” and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. “The decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,” Malik said.
The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.
“When you take the law into your own hand, whether you’re an MNA or MPA or opposition leader … the [status] doesn’t matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.”
Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.
Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were “carefully curated” via “planning” to precisely attack over 200 locations.
Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.
 






PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that “neither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.”
He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the “biased decision” in the high court.
 






Terming the decision “outright injustice”, the party’s South Punjab wing said, “The truth is that the establishment’s role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.
“These punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country’s democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!” the statement read.
 






PTI MNA and lawyer Shafqat Awan also condemned the decision. “I have never seen a more horrific and brutal decision than the one given by the Sargodha ATC judge,” he told reporters.
 






Punjab Assembly PTI MPAs restored
Today’s conviction follows a recent tussle between the PML-N’s Punjab government and the PTI, after PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan suspended 26 opposition MPAs and sought their disqualification for their “unparliamentary conduct”.
However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally rejected the disqualification petitions following negotiations between the government and the opposition.
A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p><small>2025-07-22 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2216565381fb3c0.png?r=175310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues Glof alert for GB, KP as over 200 stranded tourists rescued from Diamer amid floods</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing yesterday in Diamer’s Babusar area.
In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.
It forecast that the wet spell was likely to continue and could affect GB and KP in the current week, adding that scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, were expected in both regions.
 






The death toll in GB since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement: “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”
He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.
DC Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified. According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.
According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.
“One of the five bodies will be transported via helicopter later today,” he added.
 


Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.
A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by Dawn.com, said all travellers “should be stopped at both ends” of the road until further notice.
“All tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,” the notification read.
An emergency control room was also established that will operate “round the clock”. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.
Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told Dawn.com: “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”
Shahabuddin, a resident of Chilas, said the local people provided food and accommodation to some stranded tourists in Babusar’s Thak area of Babusar and were also assisting the rescue operation.
All doctors and paramedical staff of the Chilas District Headquarters Hospital were called on an emergency basis, according to a notification issued by medical superintendent Dr Abdul Mobin.
 


Outlining the damage caused by the floods in a statement, DC Kakar said that more than 100 houses had been fully damaged in GB in the recent torrential rains.
Faraq told Dawn.com: “In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.
Efforts underway to re-open Karakoram Highway
The process of removing debris and re-opening the Karakoram Highway (KKH) was underway by the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation, National Highway Authority and the GB administration, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“Several points from Thalichi to Chilas have been cleared. Similarly, traffic has been restored at Jaglot-Skardu road,” the report said.
It added that the process of road clearance was underway in Tatta Pani and Jalipur, while heavy machinery had been dispatched to reopen three points at Gandola Nullah.
“Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area,” Faraq said earlier today.
The GB government spokesperson shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the KKH, stranding tourists.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed authorities to provide every possible assistance and rehabilitation facilities to the flood-affected people across the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In their separate statements, they directed relevant departments to accelerate relief activities in the affected areas, as well as expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious lives due to rains.
 






‘Hundreds’ of stranded tourists rescued in Skardu
Skardu Rescue 1122, in its WhatsApp channel, said three people were injured due to the flood in the Sadpara village, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.
Ghulam Muhammad, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department, said in a statement: “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sadpara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”
According to the spokesperson, the stranded people were rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.
 
 

He said, “Heavy rain in Skardu triggered flash floods in Barge Nullah, Dhagyol Nullah and Shagri Bala Nullah on the outskirts of the city.”
“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” the official added.
NDMA issues landslide alert
According to an NDMA advisory, the following areas in the country’s north may potentially face landsliding: Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamer, Ghanche in GB; Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Bagh, Poonch in Azad Jammu and Kashmir; and Chitral, Dir, and Kohistan in KP.
In these areas, the following roads have been identified as prone to landsliding: Kohistan Road, Kolai Palas Road, Jaglot Road, Nagar Road, Hunza Road, Tatta Pani Road, Jaglot Skardu Road.
 






The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
In KP, the tourism department established a flood emergency response unit and appointed six focal persons for different areas of the province.
A notification issued by the department’s secretary Abdul Samad today, seen by Dawn.com, said that the unit was in the office of KP Culture and Tourism Authority with the helpline number 1422.
Two swept away in Rawalpindi’s DHA
Separately, rescue efforts were underway after a retired army officer and his daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by the rainwater drain in Rawalpindi, according to the police.
Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, “left his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle”, said a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” it added.
A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said. A car bumper was recovered later as the search went on.
A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.
 


Rain-related death toll rises to 234
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.
According to the NDMA’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 234 people across the country and injured 596. Of these, 13 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 135 deaths and 470 injuries. KP reported 56 fatalities, Sindh 24, Balochistan 16, two in Azad Kashmir and one death in Islamabad.

Over 61 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by house-collapse incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 826 houses and led to the deaths of 203 livestock.
A spokeswoman for the agency told AFP that the heavy rains usually start later in the monsoon season.
“Such death tolls are usually seen in August, but this year the impact has been markedly different,” she said.
 






PTA directs telecom operators to ensure uninterrupted services
Separately, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued an advisory to telecom operators, directing them to ensure uninterrupted services and maintain contingency plans for emergencies amid the ongoing floods.
A press release by the PTA said: “The advisory stresses the protection of telecom infrastructure in high-risk areas, availability of critical resources, immediate reporting of service disruptions, and dissemination of flood-related information to the public.”
“Operators have been advised to ensure the continuity of essential services, deploy trained teams, coordinate with local authorities, and efficiently address consumer complaints in affected regions.”
The PTA also activated its National Emergency Telecommunication Coordination Centre and established contact points at its headquarters and zonal offices for real-time coordination, the statement said.
The authority affirmed it was “closely monitoring the situation and will keep the public updated on service restoration efforts in flood-affected areas”.

The Fidic Asia-Pacific Awards honour excellence in consulting engineering across the region, spotlighting outstanding projects, emerging leaders, and industry strength, according to its website. Winners are announced at the Asia Pacific Infrastructure Conference in three categories: Powerhouse Awards, Outstanding Project Awards, and Emerging Leaders Awards.
The award to the Quetta International Airport Runway Reconstruction project was conferred at the Fidic Asia Pacific Conference 2025 held from July 15-17 in Islamabad, the PAA said on Sunday.
“This distinguished accolade recognises the successful delivery of Pakistan’s longest and structurally largest rigid runway, executed in sectional phases on an operational joint-user airfield,” the PAA statement said.
“Remarkably, the project was delivered with zero claims, zero safety incidents, and no closure of operations, setting a new benchmark in aviation infrastructure development.”
The award was jointly conferred upon the PAA and the project consultants in “recognition of their effective collaboration, technical expertise, and commitment to safety and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle”.
The upgraded runway was completed at an estimated cost of Rs5 billion, and received its first flight PK-3250 from Islamabad on May 31, 2023.
Further underscoring the project’s significance, Palomino Elvira, a FIDIC-accredited international mediator and advisor on global construction contracts, extended an invitation to the PAA to present the project as a case study at upcoming Fidic conferences in South Africa and France later this year, the PAA said.
This recognition marks a proud moment for Pakistan’s aviation and engineering sectors, placing PAA’s excellence on a global stage, the statement added.</p><small>2025-07-22 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615254-four-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-kalat-sanitisation-operationhistans-kalat-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian-backed terrorists killed in Kalat sanitisation operation</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries conducted a bilateral training drill involving their special forces with a high-intensity final test exercise in Karachi in February. The bilateral training exercise was held between the Special Operations Forces (SOFs) of Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) and Special Service Group of Pakistan Navy (SSG-N).
A statement issued today from the Pakistan Navy’s (PN) Director General Public Relations said RSNF Chief of the Naval Staff Vice Admiral Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Ghuraybi met Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad, on Tuesday.
The Saudi naval chief was received by Admiral Ashraf and presented with a guard of honour. He was also introduced to the principal staff officers.
“During meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, regional maritime security situation and avenues for enhanced cooperation in defence, training and security. Dignitaries appreciated successful conduct of PN-RSNF Ex Naseem Al Bahr-XV held at North Arabian Sea this year.”
 






Admiral Naveed Ashraf highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s initiatives for ensuring maritime security and regional stability through the Regional Maritime Security Patrols (RMSP) mechanism.
The Saudi naval chief appreciated and acknowledged the Pakistan Navy’s contributions and “unwavering commitment to collaborative maritime security efforts in the region”, the statement said.
 






It added that he “commended PN for the quality training being imparted to RSNF cadets at Pakistan Naval Academy and onboard PN Ships, acknowledging its profound impact on their professional development”.
The two naval chiefs pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of the existing bilateral defence relationship between the countries.
The statement said that the PN and RSNF enjoyed a “long-standing and brotherly relationship”, adding that the RSNF chief’s visit would further enhance bilateral defence collaboration between the two countries.</p><small>2025-07-22 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615244-punjab-assembly-acting-speaker-restores-26-suspended-opposition-lawmakers' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly acting speaker restores 26 suspended opposition lawmakers</strong></a><br><p>

Swat District Police Spokesperson Moin Fayaz said in a statement that the victim, Farhan, had missed classes for a few days before the incident occurred.
Police and eyewitnesses said that three teachers reportedly beat Farhan in front of fellow students.
“He had just returned to school after being absent for some days,” said one of Farhan’s classmates, who chose not to be named.
“Our teachers started hitting him hard. Later, they dragged him into a side room and kept beating him. I was called in to bring water. He drank a little, then put his head in my lap — and just went silent.”
Farhan was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival, according to Fayaz.
A first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, has been registered against all three suspects under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Section 37 (punishment for violence) of the Child Protection Act (CPA).
“One of the suspects has been taken into custody, while efforts are underway to arrest the other two.
“This is a deeply disturbing case. A thorough investigation is ongoing, and we are committed to ensuring justice for the child and his family,” Fayaz said.
Farhan’s uncle, Saddar Ayaz, told Dawn.com that when his nephew was at home, he was afraid to go back to the madressah and did not want to return.
“I took him to the seminary myself, handed him over to the teachers, and went back,” Ayaz said. “Later that evening, one of the teachers called me and told me that my nephew had fallen in the toilet and died.”
Human rights groups and local residents have demanded action — not just to punish those responsible, but to prevent future tragedies.
“Farhan could have been any of our children,” said Haider Ali, a local elder. “He went to study. He never came back.”
Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.
In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was arrested for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p><small>2025-07-22 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615238-punjab-assembly-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-10-years-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly opposition leader, PTI workers sentenced to 10 years in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), 221 people have been killed and more than 500 others injured in rain-related incidents since June 26.
According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul, a woman and her two sons were attempting to cross a stream in the Sur Dherai area of Malam Jabba, when her children drowned.
“The mother, holding her 10-month-old baby in her arms, was trying to guide her seven-year-old son across the stream when a flash flood struck. In the chaos, she lost control, and the child in her arms was swept away,” Gul said.
The bodies of the two sons were recovered by rescue personnel after hours of coordinated effort, the official added.
In a separate incident in Gujar Band Shanko area of Madyan, a house collapsed due to heavy rainfall, claiming the lives of three children and seriously injuring a woman.
Upon receiving the emergency call, Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene and retrieved the victims from the rubble with assistance from local volunteers, the spokesperson said.
They were later taken to the Civil Hospital Madyan, where the injured woman was placed under critical care.
Authorities have issued advisories urging residents, particularly those living in mountainous or low-lying areas, to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing monsoon season.
The district administration said it was closely monitoring weather patterns and has mobilised emergency services to respond to any further incidents caused by the relentless rains.
In June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths in Swat while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
Damages as rain spell hits KP
A new spell of monsoon rains on Monday hit several parts of the province, damaging houses and crops and suspending traffic.
The high flood in Chitral River triggered by the fast melting of glaciers washed six houses and a large chunk of the farmlands of Junali Koch village near Booni town.
In Yarkhon Valley of Upper Chitral, heavy rains wreaked havoc in Arakhan village in Mirgram and severely damaged dozens of houses. According to residents of the affected villages, a large number of livestock were washed away by the flash floods.
Similarly, the Chitral River was flooded, leaving houses and infrastructure in Ayunand and other low-lying areas of Lower Chitral at risk of damage.
In Bajaur tribal district, authorities closed the Jar Bypass Road, which connects the district to the rest of the country via the main Bajaur-Munda Road, to traffic after heavy rains triggered flooding.
District authorities urged people to use Khar-Qazfi Bypass Road to avoid any potential incidents. Rescue 1122 stated that rescuers have been deployed to deal with any emergency eventuality.
The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on Darra Tang Road. Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between KP and Punjab were stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.</p><small>2025-07-22 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615230-telecom-companies-directed-to-ensure-uninterrupted-services-amid-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Telecom companies directed to ensure uninterrupted services amid heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>

In the fiscal year 2024, the US issued nearly 11 million non-immigrant visas according to the State Department. These encompass international students, many leisure and business travellers and other temporary visitors.
The new fee will apply to all visitors requiring non-immigrant visas to enter the US. This does not include tourists and business travellers from countries that are included in the Visa Waiver Programme — including Australia and many European countries — that do not need visas for stays of 90 days or less.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown PC law firm’s immigration attorney, Steven A. Brown, said in a post, “The intent behind this refund provision is to incentivise compliance with US immigration laws by treating the $250 as a refundable security deposit — essentially rewarding those who follow the rules.”
However, he added that the refund is not automatic and that “the burden will likely fall on the visa holder to prove compliance” in an as-yet-undefined refund application process.
“Until those procedures are announced, employers and foreign nationals should treat the $250 visa integrity fee as a non-refundable upfront cost and plan accordingly. If a refund becomes viable in the future, it may provide an added benefit — but for now, it remains a theoretical incentive awaiting implementation guidelines.”
In an email to CNN, Brown noted that the purpose of the fee was unclear, saying that in general, immigration fees were meant to cover adjudication or issuance expenses, but that theoretically, all visa integrity fees could be refunded in a “perfect world” with no overstays or violations.
No specific information has been provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the refund process or other aspects of the policy, including when it will be rolled out.
“The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN.
A State Department spokesperson said that details of the change, implemented by DHS, would be posted on the State Department’s visa information page.
The spokesperson said that the purpose of the fee was to “support the administration’s priorities of strengthening immigration enforcement, deterring visa overstays, and funding border security.”
The initial fee for the 2025 fiscal year has been outlined as either $250 or “such amount as the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish, by rule”, whichever amount is greater. The fee is subject to annual adjustments for inflation.
The bill provision added that fees that were not reimbursed would be “deposited into the general fund of the treasury”.
The US Travel Association, a nonprofit organisation, called the new visa fee “a giant leap backwards” despite praising other aspects of the domestic policy bill.
The senior vice president of government relations for the association, Erik Hansen, said in a statement that the fee “adds an unnecessary financial barrier for international visitors”.
The association calculated that the fee would boost the upfront costs of visiting the US by 144pc.
“Even if it is technically reimbursable, the added complexity and cost will discourage visitors,” Hansen said.
Meanwhile, the CEO of the association, Geoff Freeman, called the fee a “foolish” move that undercut otherwise smart investments in travel infrastructure and security, according to a statement on US Travel SmartBrief.
He argued that imposing new costs on travellers “undermines efforts to attract international visitors and support the US economy”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-07-22 08:29</small></div><hr>
