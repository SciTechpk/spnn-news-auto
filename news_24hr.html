Since Omar Ayub’s disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant. Meanwhile, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had maintained that the matter of the nomination of the opposition leader in the house is “sub judice”.
According to the press release issued by the NA Secretariat spokesperson, earlier letters on the same matter were sent on November 19, December 5, and December 19, 2025. “However, no response has so far been received by the National Assembly Secretariat,” it said.







The statement said that the “provision of this information is essential to fulfil the constitutional requirements for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition”.
“The [National Assembly] Secretariat has been made a party in certain subjudice cases involving the former Leader of the Opposition, making it necessary to obtain the current status of the cases,” the statement said.
“In the letter, the Chief Whip of the Opposition has been requested to provide the requisite information regarding the current status of court cases pending against Omar Ayub, so that the process for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition may be completed.“
The statement by the NA Secretariat elaborated that the process for appointing a new opposition leader can only proceed “upon receipt of the required information”.
In August, the ECP had disqualified the then-opposition leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, following his conviction in cases related to the May 9 riots.
Later, incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had nominated Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of opposition leader in the National Assembly.
The PTI leadership had emphasised that the protracted delay in the appointment of the opposition leader may erode the parliament’s credibility and undermine the democratic framework.</p><small>2025-12-29 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29152927493dde6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963920/lhc-judge-hears-pti-backed-mpas-pleas-against-property-protection-law-says-matter-should-not-be-politicised' target='_blank'><strong>LHC judge hears PTI-backed MPAs’ pleas against property protection law, says matter ‘should not be politicised’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore High Court’s Justice Faisal Zaman Khan said on Monday that the matter of the new property protection law “should not be politicised”, as he took up a petition filed by two PTI-backed lawmakers challenging the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025.
The ordinance, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes, has become a point of contention with LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspending its operation on December 22 and the provinicial government voicing opposition to the court decision.
Today, Justice Faisal Zaman Khan took up a petition filed by two members of the Punjab Assembly against the ordinance. The petition was filed by MPAs Imtiaz Mahmood and Ijaz Shafi — who are both backed by the PTI, which is in the opposition in Punjab — on Saturday.
Their lawyer, Azhar Siddique, appeared before the court at the hearing where the judge asked him whether the petitioners had raised their concerns against the law in the Punjab Assembly.
The judge further remarked that despite “extensive trolling”, the court had taken up the matter.
He expressed regret that the petitioners had not raised the matter in the assembly and opted to file a petition in the court instead, observing that the issue “should not be politicised” as it involves the property rights of poor citizens.
Justice Khan asked the lawyer whether it was “necessary to politicise the matter”.
He further said that it would have been understandable had the petition been filed by an affected person and regretted that the petition was posted on Facebook before the hearing.
“Principally, you should withdraw your petition,” the judge said while addressing the lawyer.
Observing that there was no urgency to entertain the petition during the ongoing winter vacations, he instructed the court office to fix it before any appropriate bench after the vacations.
LHC suspends decisions taken by DRCs in property disputes
Separately, Justice Muhammad Raza Qureshi of the LHC suspended the decisions of deputy commissioner-led dispute resolution committees (DRC) in four other petitions filed by the aggrieved persons.
Zubaida Bibi from Changa Manga and others had approached the court against the property ownership protection law and decisions taken by DRCs.
Justice Qureshi observed that commissioners and deputy commissioners did not have the authority to “remove the possession of a property on their own”.
For their part, the petitioners pointed out that the disputes over ownership of the land were already pending before civil courts, and the status quo was also maintained by the courts.
They said the DRCs ordered the removal of possession on applications filed by the opposing parties despite the pendency of the matter before the courts.
Justice Qureshi suspended the DRCs’ decisions and ordered the office to fix the petitions before a yet-to-be-formed full bench for further hearing.
The diagreement
The recently passed legislation — Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 — mandates resolution of land disputes within 90 days. It was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31.
It empowers DCs to communicate directly with revenue officials and civil courts — a measure that is said to be aimed at preventing unnecessary stay orders that delay justice.
However, LHC CJ Neelum suspended the ordinance’s operation earlier this month, observing that “it appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
She also questioned the purpose of the law and asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The LHC CJ observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy. “If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she said.
A day after the LHC CJ’s directive, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz argued against the decision, saying in a statement that it was “not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), on the other hand, had backed the LHC CJ’s decision and cautioned the Punjab government against implementing what it describes as the “unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.</p><small>2025-12-29 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29150929761be5f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963923/terms-and-conditions-for-3-day-basant-celebrations-in-lahore-notified' target='_blank'><strong>Terms and conditions for 3-day Basant celebrations in Lahore notified</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore deputy commissioner (DC) on Monday formally notified the terms and conditions for celebrating Basant, which will only be celebrated in Lahore district from Feb 6 to 8.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, did not specify any particular area for flying kites, implying that the government had allowed festivities across the district.
The deputy commissioners of their respective districts will also be required to issue similar notifications and ensure the implementation of the conditions and restrictions identified by the Punjab government under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025, a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite flying.
Notifying the manufacturing, trade and sale of “permissible kite flying material”, the Lahore DC said that the manufacturing and trade of permissible kite flying material will be allowed from Dec 30 to Feb 8, 2026, subject to valid digital registration under Rule 3 of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025 and the regulations thereunder.
The sale of permissible kite flying material to the general public shall be allowed from Feb 1-8, exclusively by the registered sellers in accordance with the notified rules and regulations, the notification said.
The registration for manufacturers, traders or sellers of permissible kite flying material will be opened from Monday (today) through the government’s e-biz app or the festival’s website under the notified rules and regulations, it said.
It also prohibited manufacturers, traders or sellers from manufacturing, trading, storing or selling permissible kite flying material unless registered with the DC’s office under the relevant rules and regulations.
It stated that only such kite flying material, as specified in Schedule-I of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025, was to be manufactured, traded, stored, sold or used during the notified period.
It further directed that the kites should not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length while the gudda should not exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
It also directed that the kite string be made of cotton with no more than nine threads and “no less than 28-count” coated with maanjha (coating) and having a minimum sheesha size of 350 mash. The string is only to be wound in the shape of a pinna (twine balls) and the use of charkhi (spool) is strictly prohibited.
The manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, possession or use of sharp maanjha nylon or plastic cords, metallic wire or any other injurious material coated on the thread has been strictly prohibited.
All registered manufacturers, traders and sellers were directed to clearly display valid registration certificates at approved premises, as required under rule 3(6) of the regulation.
The notification added that complete records of stock, sales and movement would be maintained and produced on demand by registered manufacturers, traders and sellers to any authorised officer of the DC.
All registered kite flying associations, while complying with the responsibilities assigned under the regulation, were told to remain in close coordination with the DC and the authorised officers for the smooth and safe conduct of the kite flying event, it said.
Permissions granted under the notification were to be regulated and implemented strictly in accordance with the ordinance and its rules.
All motorcycles operating within the Lahore district were directed to comply with the safety specifications as specified in the kite flying regulation.
It directed all departments, attached departments, agencies and organisations of the government to assist the district administration and police to enforce strict compliance with all terms and conditions of the notification as per law, rules and regulations to ensure public safety.
The DC’s notification also called for all motorcycle riders within Lahore district to install safety wires in order to protect their lives.
The Punjab government issued strict instructions to the respective divisional commissioners, DCs and district police officers (DPOs) to notify the Basant dates after making arrangements for the festival to remain safe and ensure that no damage is reported to the lives and well-being of the people.
“Any violation of this notification shall render the offender liable to action under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025 and the Punjab Kite Flying Regulations, 2025 including cancellation of permission or registration, seizure of material and prosecution in accordance with the law,” the notification added.
Kite flying is being allowed in Punjab after an 18-year hiatus — former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi had banned the festival in 2007, following an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists by prohibited sharp strings, as well as judicial pressure.
The Punjab government is now trying to revive the festival, on the recommendation of PML-N chief and former premier Nawaz Sharif following meetings with Basant stakeholders.
Although the ban on kite flying continues except on the three notified days, at least two incidents have been reported — one each in Lahore and Pattoki — in which a young man and a minor girl were injured by the string of a stray kite.</p><small>2025-12-29 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642058-imran-khan-bushra-bibi-challenge-toshakhana-2-case-conviction-in-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi challenge Toshakhana-2 case conviction in IHC</strong></a><br><p>

“Yes, we have appealed his sentencing,” Hameed’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, told Dawn but did not share any details about the appeal.
Hameed was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court on December 11 after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
He had a 40-day window following his conviction and sentencing to appeal against the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) decision, according to Section 133B of the Pakistan Army Act.
The appeal is first reviewed by a Court of Appeals, led by a major general or higher, as designated by the army chief. The chief then holds the authority to confirm, revise, or overturn the sentence.
Historically, the military’s appellate process has stretched over several years.
Hameed’s sentencing
Announcing Hameed’s conviction and sentencing on December 11, the military’s media wing had said in a statement that the process of FGCM was initiated against him on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months.
“After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said.
ISPR had further stated that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
Hameed was referred to in the statement as “Mr Faiz Hameed, formerly a lieutenant general”, creating the impression he may have been stripped of his rank, although ISPR did not explicitly confirm this.
A source familiar with internal procedures told Dawn at the time any such withdrawal “is done through an administrative order” as per established rules, but declined to confirm whether it had occurred in this case.
Background
Hameed, who retired in November 2022, is the first former ISI director general and only the second three-star general in Pakistan’s history to face a full military trial and be sentenced to a jail term.
The case against him originated from accusations by property developer Kanwar Moeez Khan, who alleged that in 2017 that Hameed — then a major general in ISI — and two officers orchestrated a raid at his home and offices, seized valuables and coerced him into paying Rs40 million and financing a private television channel. The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court advised the complainant to seek remedies through the defence ministry, leading to a formal military inquiry.
While the Army Act typically allows action against retired personnel within six months of retirement, the proceedings reportedly invoked Section 2(d), which extends military jurisdiction to certain offences committed by persons not subject to military law, though exceptions were also available under Sections 31 and 40, which permit court martial regardless of time elapsed for offences involving mutiny, insubordination or fraudulent acts related to property.
A Court of Inquiry convened in April 2024 found grounds to proceed, leading to Hameed’s arrest on August 12 of that year. He was subsequently served a detailed charge sheet covering four categories of alleged misconduct: post-retirement political engagement; violations of the Official Secrets Act; misuse of authority, including the 2017 raid; and causing wrongful loss through coercive actions against Moeez.
The investigation was later widened to include several retired officers, among them retired Brig Ghaffar, retired Brig Naeem Fakhar and retired Col Asim, although the verdict did not state what determination the FGCM made regarding them.</p><small>2025-12-29 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642055-leas-foil-bla-attempt-to-groom-child-for-suicide-attack-via-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>LEAs foil BLA's attempt to groom child for suicide attack via social media</strong></a><br><p>

During his three-day visit to Lahore over the weekend, the KP chief minister had given an address at the Punjab Assembly to opposition MPAs on Friday. However, the visit was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Addressing the incident at a press conference in Lahore today, Khan said that the report on the unrest was being sent to the law enforcement agencies, which would conduct an independent investigation into the incident.
He said that he had informed the KP chief minister that a special permit was required to enter the assembly premises, and that in the absence of any other documentation, “at least” an ID card number would be necessary verification for anyone wishing to enter.
“This is a Red Zone with an extensive security parameter,” he said. “You cannot ignore it under any circumstances.”
He added that Afridi had agreed and provided a list of those accompanying him from the National and KP assemblies, which had been facilitated. However, the protocols had not been followed, he regretted.
He also accused Afridi of bringing unidentified individuals into the Assembly premises.
“Unauthorised entry is not permissible … work progresses according to the rules. Every little thing … Every individual has to be permitted to be allowed to enter the [assembly] premises,” he stressed.
Criticising the opposition, the speaker said raising objections to pieces of legislation was their democratic right but resorting to siege, arson and chaos reflected their incompetence and intent to create instability in the country.
“If you lack tolerance, then shut down the business of democracy,” he remarked, adding that assembly sessions cost billions of rupees and disruptions wasted public funds.
He further said that PTI workers were not barred from visiting the Punjab Assembly but hooliganism and violence would not be tolerated.
During his press conference, the speaker regretted that political parties’ outreach had become increasingly “regional” and confined to a single province, adding that they should be encouraged to increase their national outreach.
“Political parties strengthen the federation,” he said. “If their outreach is national … then the federation becomes strong.”
The speaker said that he had constituted a “high-powered” inquiry committee to investigate the incident, which was tasked to investigate the CCTV footage of Afridi’s arrival.
The Speaker said that the footage depicted a breach of protocol at the gates, firstly because there was a greater-than-expected number of people accompanying the chief minister. Multiple members of the entourage were not on the assembly’s list and were also unable to display proof of identity as requested, violating the security standard operating procedures, he said.
According to Khan, the situation then escalated as security staff were “manhandled” after the unidentified individuals were stopped.
According to the committee’s findings, he said, the unauthorised persons were those convicted in the past, including some under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
“These people who are charged and convicted with having burned government buildings — instead of putting them in jail, you’ll bring them into the Punjab Assembly?” he said. “This cannot be allowed under any circumstances.”
Khan stressed that even the speaker of the assembly, who was thought of as all-important, was bound “by every word written in the procedure”.
He recalled that the PTI had violated even the sanctity of the most sacred places for Muslims in Saudi Arabia for their political agenda.
“Those who do not respect the sanctity of holy limits cannot respect democratic institutions,” he said, vowing action against all responsible individuals as per the investigation report.
Khan reiterated that violations had occurred not only inside the Punjab Assembly but beyond it as well, and urged all institutions to conduct thorough investigations to ensure accountability and uphold democratic norms.</p><small>2025-12-29 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29131706a0a4f0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963919/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-persecution-of-minorities-in-india-following-reports-of-vandalism-marring-christmas-festivities' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses concern over persecution of minorities in India following reports of vandalism marring Christmas festivities</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday that the persecution of minorities in India was a matter of “deep concern” following incidents of vandalism reported in the neighbouring country ahead of Christmas.
Last week, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “The persecution of minorities in India is a matter of deep concern.
“Recent condemnable incidents of vandalism during Christmas, as well as state-sponsored campaigns targeting Muslims — including the demolition of their homes and repeated lynchings, notably the case of Muhammad Akhlaq, in which the state worked to shield the perpetrators from accountability — have deepened fear and alienation among Muslims,” it said.







Akhlaq, a 50-year-old man was beaten to death in India in 2015, while his 22-year-old son was severely injured after it was rumoured that the family had been storing and consuming beef in India’s Uttar Pradesh.
Last month, The Hindu reported that the Uttar Pradesh government was seeking to withdraw the case against the accused. Last week, Times of India reported that the government’s plea had been dismissed.
In its statement, the FO said, “The list of such victims is sadly long. The international community should take note of these developments and take appropriate steps to help protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities in India.”
Last week, The Indian Express reported that a mob stormed a mall and destroyed Christmas installations in the city of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state.

The incident occurred on the same day the Sarva Hindu Samaj organisation called for a “bandh” — a general strike — to protest alleged religious conversions and recent clashes over the burial of a person from a converted family.
“Around 80-90 people barged in,” an employee of the mall told The Indian Express, adding that the mob threatened and shouted at the staff, and “indulged in violence”.
Separately, in the Nalbari district of Assam, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal vandalised a school and disrupted Christmas preparations. The group has been classified as a militant religious organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency.
An unidentified police official told The Hindu that activists targeted St. Mary’s School in Panigaon village.
“The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme,” the official said. “They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration.”</p><small>2025-12-29 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642040-weaponisation-of-water-ppps-shery-rehman-slams-india-for-approving-hydropower-project-on-chenab' target='_blank'><strong>'Weaponisation of water': PPP's Sherry Rehman slams India for approving hydropower project on Chenab</strong></a><br><p>

The NDMA said that a “westerly wave” is likely to approach the western parts of the country from December 29 (today), resulting in rain and snowfall in various areas from tonight till January 2.
It said that the system was expected to grip “most upper and central parts of the country on Dec 31 and persist in the upper regions till the morning of Jan 2“.
According to the NDMA, “snowfall may lead to road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch and Haveli from the night of Dec 30 till the morning of Jan 2.”
It also projected a likelihood of “landslides and avalanches in the hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the same period“.
The authority advised tourists to exercise caution and “avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable and high-altitude areas”. In central and southern Punjab as well as Sindh, fog conditions are expected during the wet spell, it said.
It added that, “in view of the anticipated conditions, the NDMA has advised all relevant provincial disaster management authorities, the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, the State Disaster Management Authority and the Islamabad Capital Territory administration to ensure all necessary preparedness and response measures“.
It said in its advisory said that relevant authorities “have been urged to remain vigilant, ensure timely dissemination of information, keep emergency response teams on alert, and take proactive measures to minimise potential risks to life, property and critical infrastructure“.
The statement added that the NDMA was “closely monitoring the situation”.
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its weather advisory, has warned of rain and thunderstorms with snowfall over the hills in most parts of the country in the coming week.
It said that daytime temperatures were expected to drop further, particularly after the system passes.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642035-ndma-issues-alert-as-westerly-wave-set-to-enter-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues alert as westerly wave set to enter Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Butt appeared before the sessions court (Central) upon the expiry of his interim bail, which was granted to him on December 20. The hearing, however, was marred by violence and chaos as Butt was attacked.
Butt‘s counsel, Mian Ali Ashfaq, alleged in a post on social media platform X that his client had been attacked by “some lawyers” at Karachi City Courts’ premises during the hearing of a case.







He said the attack was carried out in his presence, in which Butt was injured.
“[They] continued to beat him despite being repeatedly asked to stop,” Ashfaq said, terming “such conduct by the lawyers unprofessional”.
He added, “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country.”
Ashfaq further stated that if “lawyers will become a party [in cases] every other day and continue to attack private litigants on court premises,  their respect will suffer an immense and continuous decline“.
“This is an unfortunate aspect that has no place in any educated society,” he said.
A video shared after the incident showed Butt, in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him.
Another video showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “Karachi Bar Zindabad” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Riaz Solangi, who is the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
In the video, Solangi is seen saying Butt had made a video in which he had used inappropriate words for lawyers. Another person in the group, who also appeared to be a lawyer from his attire, can be seen saying that “what has happened today, we did that over his words for lawyers and misbehaviour against them […] Anyone who says anything against lawyers will end up in the same condition”.
Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and seen one of the videos.
Mubarak and Butt, who have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, had returned to Pakistan together on December 10 from London after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by their relatives.
The have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, and Butt’s interim bail in the case that was taken up by the sessions court today has now been extended till January 13.
The case
Solangi had lodged a complaint against Butt in January at the Hyderi Market police station, under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the first information report (FIR), the complainant said that in December 2024, he watched a viral video of the YouTuber in which he was allegedly performing prayer (namaz) while music was playing in the background.
It is pertinent to mention that the FIR was registered after a sessions court allowed the complainant’s application filed under Section 22-A, seeking directives for the Hyderi Market SHO to lodge a case against the YouTuber.
As the video went viral on social media, Butt posted subsequent videos on his official Facebook page in January in which he was seen sitting with scholars from different schools of thought.
In the three-part video, he had issued an apology, stating that if anyone’s feelings were hurt by his unintentional actions, he deeply regretted it.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642027-watch-karachi-zoo-gets-new-lion-enclosure-reptile-house' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Karachi Zoo gets new lion enclosure, Reptile House</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on the social media platform X, the PPP leader said, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
“As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said.







“Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said.
“This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said.
According to the Times of India, a panel of the Indian environment ministry has approved the Dulhasti State-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in the Kishtwar district of occupied Kashmir.
The report said that the 260MW project comes two months after the approval of the 1,856MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project on the same river. It said that both the projects aimed to “harness the potential of the Chenab”.
A similar report was also carried by The Hindu, which added, “With the IWT now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.”
The development comes days after United Nations experts expressed concern that India’s “unlawful use of force” on Pakistan’s territory in response to the April 22 Paha­lgam attack in occupied Kashmir appe­ared to have “violated the rights to life and security of person”. This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a correspondence dated Oct 16, which was made public on Dec 15.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The five UN experts, who compiled the correspondence, also observed that New Delhi’s actions “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan” under the IWT.
Meanwhile, earlier this month, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi had stated that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, with the situation badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/261632289b54a63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963168/from-sick-man-to-regional-security-provider-pakistans-year-of-geopolitical-openings' target='_blank'><strong>From sick man to regional security provider: Pakistan’s year of geopolitical openings</strong></a><br><p>For much of the past decade, Pakistan had been strategically adrift — crippled by economic mismanagement, plagued by political instability, and viewed by allies and partners as a state whose problems needed to be managed lest they create wider instability. Simply put, we were broadly seen as the sick man of South Asia.
By the time 2025 rolled in, the country‘s polycrisis was still raging. But fast forward a few months, and the year’s outlook shifted to one of opportunities, with an emerging geopolitical reality in the region.
Much like historical geopolitical openings that have come Pakistan’s way, this moment also arose from a confluence of regional shocks and strategic recalculations that reshaped how power and security are being reassessed around the world, particularly in West Asia and the Middle East.
A unique window
Two developments in particular created a unique window for Pakistan: the first was the Trump administration’s post-ceasefire plan for Gaza. Despite being contested over its details, the initiative compelled regional actors to confront an uncomfortable truth: the United States was prepared to underwrite a new regional security and political architecture that would require regional powers to take greater ownership of their own security needs.
Washington’s strategic evolution — or retreat, as referred to by some — is not unique to the Middle East; from Europe to East Asia, the Trump administration wants its allies and partners to take greater ownership of their own security.

 

The second and more consequential event occurred when Israel’s increasingly belligerent actions culminated in Tel Aviv’s strikes on Doha. This served as an inflexion point for Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, and underscored a hard reality: advanced air defences, American guarantees, and quiet normalisation channels will not be enough to secure these countries against an increasingly radical and belligerent Israel. In addition, the United States, despite being Israel’s patron, would do very little to stop rogue Israeli actions.
In that environment, regional actors began to look anew at who could actually deliver kinetic capability at scale, under pressure, and without collapsing politically or operationally. And this is where Pakistan entered the scene.
This opening, however, would not have materialised without Pakistan’s military performance against India in a short but intense conflict earlier in the year. Widely written off as overstretched and hollowed out by years of economic and political crises, Pakistan demonstrated that it retained a credible, modern, and integrated conventional war-fighting capability. Its air force, in particular, showcased operational proficiency and command-and-control sophistication that surprised foreign observers.
The signal was not lost in the Middle East. Pakistan showed that it could do something no regional military other than Israel has consistently demonstrated: deliver calibrated, high-end kinetic force without losing control of its skies. That performance reframed Pakistan from being a problematic country to one that could become a potential regional security provider. In addition, Islamabad’s successes showcased that when paired with effective training and doctrine, Chinese weapons platforms could outperform next-gen Western systems.
Without this demonstration, the Strategic Defence and Mutual Assistance agreement with Saudi Arabia would simply not have been possible. The pact formalised what had long been implicit, marking a significant shift in the regional scales of power.
All of a sudden, now, Pakistan, long viewed through the lens of instability, emerged as a country that could be a net security provider to the region. All of this does not mean that Pakistan’s very real problems have magically disappeared; 2026 will be a year that will put the country to the test, and to capitalise on this geopolitical moment, Pakistan will need to put in a lot of hard yards, many of them at home.
What next?
For one, a resurgent insurgency, fuelled by militant sanctuaries across the Afghan border, continues to sap state capacity and public confidence. Without sustained pressure and a coherent strategy toward Kabul, Pakistan risks being strategically overextended even as it seeks a larger regional role.
At the same time, tensions with India remain acute, with dialogue effectively frozen. In the absence of bilateral engagement, crisis management will increasingly rely on third parties — most notably Washington and Riyadh — to prevent escalation and preserve deterrence stability. That may be workable in the short term, but it is not a substitute for a longer-term framework to manage rivalry. At some point, Islamabad and Delhi will have to sit across the table, but until then, Pakistan should seek to ensure that the ceasefire at the Line of Control holds.
Managing these two borders should be the top priority.

 

Regionally, Pakistan’s involvement in the post-Gaza political process will also require careful calibration. Coordination with Arab partners and Turkiye will be essential, as will managing domestic spoilers who may see regional engagement as an ideological compromise.
The core strategy here should be to let Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and other Arab states take the lead; these countries have a far bigger stake in the future of Gaza and Palestine, and Pakistan’s approach should be to be seen as being supportive of their efforts. The margin for error is thin; missteps could quickly erode the credibility Islamabad has only just regained.
Finally, none of this will matter if economic stabilisation falters. The hard-won gains of recent months have only delivered economic stability; sustainable growth remains a distant dream. Building momentum will require sticking to economic reforms; the successful privatisation of the Pakistan International Airlines makes one confident that momentum will be built up in the coming weeks.
Energy sector reforms should be the next big priority, and the singular focus should be to grow the competitiveness of Pakistani exports of both goods and services.
The silver lining
The glimmer of hope here is that there is a clear recognition in Islamabad and Rawalpindi that geopolitical relevance cannot be sustained without a robust and modern economic base.
A country that could end up on the verge of external default within weeks can never be seen as a stable actor, let alone a net security provider to a region as complex as the Middle East. Whether this recognition turns into momentum that can be sustained for the next few years remains to be seen, but 2026 will be a litmus test for those — at home and abroad — who have backed the current ruling dispensation.
After years of strategic drift, 2025 has placed Pakistan in a rare geopolitical sweet spot where its allies and partners, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and China, see it as a country that offers them things they value and need.
Whether 2026 becomes the year Pakistan converts that moment into a durable influence will depend on statecraft, discipline, and follow-through.</p><small>2025-12-29 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641912-decoding-events-that-defined-pakistans-political-landscape-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Decoding events that defined Pakistan's political landscape in 2025</strong></a><br><p>

Father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Sydney’s Bondi Beach on December 14, killing 15 people and wounding dozens in what authorities have described as an anti-Semitic terrorist attack.
Despite the tragedy, tales of heroism emerged of those who tried to stop the two gunmen during their deadly rampage.
Among them was Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit seller, who went viral for ducking between parked cars as the shooting unfolded and then wresting a gun from one of the assailants.

 

“My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being’s life and not killing innocent people,” he told CBS News in an interview that airs on Monday.
“I know I saved lots, but I feel sorry for the lost.”
Ahmed was shot several times in the shoulder after tussling with one of the gunmen and underwent several rounds of surgery.
He recalled the moment he “jumped” on the gunman’s back, holding him with his right hand and said: “Drop your gun, stop doing what you’re doing”.
“I don’t want to see people killed in front of me, I don’t want to see blood, I don’t want to hear his gun, I don’t want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help,” Ahmed told the television network.
Ahmed was at the beach getting a cup of coffee when the shooting occurred.
The father of two emigrated to Australia from Syria in 2007; his uncle Mohammed, a farmer, had told AFP in Ahmed’s hometown of Al-Nayrab days after the shooting.
“His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” Mohammed said.
The Australian government has fast-tracked and granted a number of visas for Ahmed’s family, local media reported.
“Ahmed has shown the courage and values we want in Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement.
One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, remains in custody on charges including terrorism and 15 murders, as well as committing a “terrorist act” and planting a bomb with intent to harm. He has yet to enter a plea.</p><small>2025-12-29 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29101859e41f066.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963903/china-launches-war-games-around-taiwan-as-island-vows-to-defend-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>China launches war games around Taiwan as island vows to defend democracy</strong></a><br><p>China’s military moved army, naval, air force and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its “Justice Mission 2025” drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.
The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8am (5am PKT).
This marks China’s sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island, and follows a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing’s territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
The exercises began 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China’s defence ministry and warnings the military would “take forceful measures” in response.
China’s military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practice striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated attack on the island from multiple directions.
“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills.
A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation and undermine regional peace, and called on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.
Scare tactics
The island’s defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around the island over the last 24 hours, and that Taiwan’s military was on high alert and poised to carry out “rapid response exercises”.
That particular drill is designed to move troops swiftly in case China suddenly turns one of its drills around the island into an attack.
“All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the defence ministry said.
Dozens of Chinese military boats and planes were operating near Taiwan on Monday, and some of them “deliberately closing in” to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as being 24 nautical miles from its coast, a senior Taiwan security official told Reuters.
Taiwan’s coast guard said it had dispatched large ships in reaction to Chinese coast guard activity near the island’s waters and that it was working with the island’s military to minimise the drills’ impact on maritime routes and fishing areas.

 

Taiwan stock markets were unaffected by the drills, up 0.6 per cent to a record high in morning trading.
“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher based in the capital, Taipei.
“Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan’s current government and how they choose to respond.”
Taiwan rejects China’s claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island’s future.
‘Smash the separatist scoundrels’
The Chinese military released two posters titled “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions,” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”, along with a third graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.
China’s state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan’s vital deep-water Port of Keelung to the island’s north and Kaohsiung to Taiwan’s south, the island’s largest port city.
While the PLA practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at “deterrence” of outside military intervention.
The Japanese prime minister’s remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging stressing its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan’s “return to China” after World War Two was central to Beijing’s vision of the global order.
The first poster appeared to show the armada of civilian ships China is mobilising to help in an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults were also shown.
“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” the poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”
The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan and spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te a “parasite” and began using the cartoon green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.
“I think their (China’s) goal is, as they said, ‘keep the island, not the people,’” said Stephanie Huang, a 56-year-old interior designer. “They just want to save face by claiming Taiwan as part of their own country, but Taiwanese people don’t see it that way.

The authority also approved removing excise duty on industrial hemp and hemp seed oil while giving approval to increase in excise duty on full-spectrum Cannabidiol and Tetrahydrocannabinol.
The documents read that CRA approved reducing licence fee for cannabis cultivation from Rs0.6 million to Rs0.5 million and licence fee for cannabis processing from Rs1.5 million to Rs1 million. It read that CRA reduced the licence fee for hemp processing from Rs0.7 million to Rs0.5 million while excise duty on full-spectrum Cannabidiol and Tetrahydrocannabinol was increased from Rs3,000 per kilogram to Rs5000 per kilogram.
The decision was taken during a meeting held with minister for excise, taxation and narcotics in the chair on December 22, the document said. It added that the meeting was a continuation of the sub-committee meeting held on December 4 and had recommended the changes.
The documents said that during CRA meeting, the proposed Hemp Model for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was presented before the committee where secretary of excise, taxation and narcotics control and secretary of health emphasised that the proposed model may be simplified for ease of doing business and facilitation of investors.

 

After thorough deliberation, the meeting approved that pilot hemp cultivation licences would be issued to reputed industries in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and industries would enter into partnership with farmers.
CRA approved application form for cultivation and processing of industrial hemp licence, Tetrahydrocannabinol sampling and analysis form, periodic inspection form and other mandatory registers.
The committee approved that Board of Investment (BOI) and industries department would extend facilitation in joint venture of industry and farmers, registration of farmers as private or cooperative company kept optional.
It approved that the import of hemp seed and its certification would be the responsibility of licensed industry concerned. Cannabis cultivation and processing will be postponed for the time being and medicinal cannabis regulation and its product management will be viewed in light of the requirements and criterion of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan.
The document said that a sub-committee would be constituted for devising a cannabis model and revisiting cannabis regulations within 15 days for its constitution.

According to experts, the algal bloom, which has turned seawater green along Pakistan’s coast as well as neighbouring Iran, is caused by a single-celled organism Noctiluca.
“These dolphins are often seen in this season and recorded by fishermen. The ongoing bloom is neither toxic nor poses any threat to fishermen,” Director of Marine Fisheries, Balochistan, Ahmed Nadeem told Dawn, adding that such blooms were observed in the area once to twice a year.
About its possible impact on fisheries, Mr Nadeem said: “There is no serious negative impact, though it does contribute to marine productivity once it starts decomposing at the bank of the sea and turns into nutrients for marine life.”
According to him, the bloom doesn’t cause a bad smell. “Small fish that get trapped in the bloom and die cause the stench.”

Algal bloom termed ‘beneficial’ as fish freely congregate in the area

Seconding Mr Ahmed’s opinion, Muhammad Moazzam Khan, Technical Adviser at the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P), said that Noctiluca blooms were not harmful in most cases and rather increased the productivity of marine water.
“It is heartening that pods of bottlenose dolphins are seen within the Gwadar (West Bay), which verifies that the bloom is not affecting the marine biodiversity of the area,” he said.
Asked about the mass fish mortality reported from Ormara (East Bay) in 2016, which was also reportedly caused by a Noctiluca bloom, he said a symbiont called Protoeuglena noctilucae (a tiny green flagellate microorganism) wasn’t present in the bloom.
“Hence, Noctiluca did not produce oxygen but rather consumed all oxygen in the seawater of the area, resulting in mass fish mortality. However, currently we are seeing green Noctiluca bloom. What has given it this colour is Protoeuglena noctilucae that produces oxygen under the sunlight and contributes to marine productivity.”
According to WWF-P, the winter bloom is a characteristic of the northern Arabian Sea. There have been studies conducted by the organisation, which indicate that the bloom is triggered by the spread of cold water from upwelling in some part of the Arabian Sea and its spread under the influence of eddy formation during this period.
Linking this bloom, it says, with Eutrophication is not scientifically substantiated. Noctiluca scintillans is a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.

Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”.
Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
Mr Kundi blamed Afghanistan for the rise in terrorism and alleged the involvement of Afghan nationals in the attacks in Pakistan. He said those Afghans who did not have documents to stay in Pakistan were “illegal”. The governor said no foreign national could reside in Pakistan without valid documents and the same policy applied to the undocumented Afghans too. He added that those wishing to study or work must enter through proper legal channels.

Says foreign nationals cannot reside in country without documents

Governor Kundi claimed attacks in D.I. Khan and the Cadet College Wana involved Afghan nationals. He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged the Afghan authorities not to allow their territory to be used against Pakistan. “These terrorist elements are playing into the hands of India and Israel,” he claimed, adding that Pakistan had successfully countered India on both military and diplomatic fronts.
He said global interest in defence cooperation and trade with Pakistan was increasing. “This is evident with the frequent visits by foreign heads of state to the country,” he added.
The governor also commented on domestic politics, saying political cases should be contested through arguments rather than abuse. Without naming individuals, he referred to the PTI leadership for contradictory statements regarding the negotiations with the government.

The winter rains have made an already precarious life worse for people like Sharafi, who is among the hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian territory displaced by the war, many of whom now survive on aid provided by humanitarian organisations.
“My children are shivering from cold and fear… The tent was completely flooded within minutes,” Sharafi, 47, said on Sunday.
“We lost our blankets, and all the food is soaked,” added the father of six, who lives in a makeshift shelter with his children in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi.
Insufficient aid
Nearly 80 per cent of buildings in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged by the war, according to United Nations data.

UNRWA chief says supplies not being allowed in ‘at the scale required’

And about 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.2m residents have lost their homes, said Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza.
Of more than 300,000 tents requested to shelter displaced people, “we have received only 60,000”, Shawa told AFP, pointing to Israeli restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid into the territory.
The UN refugee agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, said the harsh weather had compounded the misery of Gazans.
“People in Gaza are surviving in flimsy, waterlogged tents & among ruins,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X.
“There is nothing inevitable about this. Aid supplies are not being allowed in at the scale required.”







Earlier this month, Gaza experienced a similar spell of heavy rain and cold. The weather caused at least 18 deaths due to the collapse of war-damaged buildings or exposure to cold.

DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho and allied groups staged simultaneous blockades across major highways and intersections in various cities across Bangladesh on Sunday, demanding justice for the killing of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi.
Hadi, a vocal critic of India who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was shot by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.
Cities hit by the protests included Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, Gazipur, Barishal, Cumilla and Khulna.
Leaders and activists of Inqilab Moncho blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the third consecutive day on Sunday.
“Statements from the administration are nothing but eyewash. They are simply trying to waste time. The perpetrators could have been arrested on the very day the shooting happened,” said Naim Islam, a central member of Inqilab Moncho.
“The government must disclose to the public who is pressuring whom. They claim some people have been arrested, but the real killer must be brought to justice,” he added.
“The interim government is determined to ensure justice for the [Hadi’s] killing,” he said, adding that police, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, and intelligence agencies were working closely and in coordination to uncover the facts behind the murder.
Pressure has been mounting on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.
Bangladesh’s home adviser, retired Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said investigators were expected to submit the charge sheet in the popular student leader’s murder case within 10 days.
He said authorities had made significant progress, but not everything could be disclosed at the moment to protect the integrity of the investigation and to identify both the perpetrators and those who backed them.
He said 11 people have so far been arrested in the case, including the wife and parents of the alleged mastermind, Faisal Karim Masud.
Among the arrestees, six gave confessional statements under Section 164, while four witnesses also gave statements under the same provision, the adviser said.
Based on information from the arrestees, witness statements, reviews of recovered evidence and an overall assessment, the investigation is now in its final stage, he added.
“I request everyone to remain patient,” he said, adding that a decision had already been made to transfer the case to a speedy trial tribunal.
“I want to assure you that the trial in the Hadi murder case will be completed within the tenure of the current interim government.”
‘Fled to India’
Meanwhile, AFP quoted Bangladesh police as saying that Hadi’s suspected killers had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with India.
“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border on Dec 12.
“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.

LAHORE: After spending three days in the provincial capital galvanising party supporters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Min­ister Sohail Afridi said the PTI would not engage in talks with the government without first taking to the streets to demonstrate its opposition to the status quo.
His remarks come as party leaders are split into two camps: one led by veterans favouring dialogue, while the other is bent on street agitation as per the directions of the incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
A day earlier, CM Afridi said the decision to initiate talks rested with the opposition alliance, and that he was in charge of the ‘street movement’.
CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, had arrived in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of Imran Khan. He left the provincial capital in the evening. Before Afridi, his predecessor, Ali Amin Gandapur, also came to Lahore earlier this year, ostensibly to launch a protest drive.
Earlier in the day, Mr Afridi told journalists at a meeting that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.
Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.”
Sharing his thoughts about the dialogue offered by the government, the CM claimed there must have been some ‘direction’ from the powers that be to the PM that he offered talks. He said talks could be meaningful only after inclusion of individuals who wielded power and influence.
“We could not develop a working relationship with the establishment because they did not accept my policy and I could not accept their policy,” he said in response to a question about him reaching out to the powerful quarters.
“The establishment now knows that the incumbent rulers were unable to take Pakistan forward,” he said, while accusing the ruling parties of corruption and economic mismanagement.
Mr Afridi said it was not necessary that the PTI pick D-Chowk in Islamabad as its protest site, as it did in November last year, adding that it was also not important to end the protest after a couple of days.
In an X post, the CM also announced his intention of visiting Karachi for the ‘street movement’.







Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, meanwhile, said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government wants the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”
Mr Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed — otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.
Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassaan Niazi.
The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”
“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.
“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.
Azma ridicules PTI
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”
In a statement on X, Ms Bokhari quipped that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.







She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, she said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.
“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.

Speaking at a press conference at a park adjacent to the party’s Bahadurabad headquarters, Mr Kamal said if Mr Hussain “truly considers himself innocent, he should approach a London court and file a petition for a transparent investigation into the brutal murder of Dr Imran Farooq”.
It may be noted that in 2020 an Islamabad anti-terrorism court had sentenced three men — Syed Mohsin Ali, Moazzam Ali and Khalid Shamim — to life imprisonment and declared Mr Hussain an absconder in the Imran Farooq murder case.
The MQM-P leader’s presser came a day after the burial of Dr Imran Farooq’s widow Shumaila, who died a couple of days ago in London. Mr Kamal, as well as leaders of MQM factions, attended the funeral and expressed their condolence with her two sons and other family members.
During his press conference, Mr Kamal lost his cool and used foul language against Mr Hussain. He also alleged donations were collected from around the world in the name of sending Shumaila’s body to Pakistan.
Lamenting that Dr Imran Farooq’s children “are being dragged onto social media and exploited for political purposes”, Mr Kamal advised them to stay away from Mr Hussain and his faction.
MQM-L responds
Meanwhile, the MQM-L condemned Mr Kamal’s press conference and challenged him to prove his allegations.
Senior London-based leader Mustafa Azizabadi told an online media briefing that “Kamal’s press conference is an extremely disgraceful attempt to drag the innocent children of Dr Imran Farooq”.
He condemned use of foul language by Mr Kamal.
He also played video clips showing Dr Imran Farooq’s late father telling a TV host that the killers of his son were with Mr Kamal.
Mr Azizabadi said his party was not making allegations against anyone, but that people should decide for themselves after watching Imran Farooq’s father’s video.

LAKKI MARWAT: At least 12 terrorists were killed and several others injured in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) carried out by security forces in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday.
The military’s media wing said that security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Balo­chistan’s Kalat district, killing four terrorists.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out the previous day following intelligence repo­rts about the presence of terrorists affiliated with Fitna al Hindustan — the term the state uses for Balochistan-based separatist groups.
During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were killed, the ISPR said in the statement.
It added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who had been actively involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored terrorist found in the area. [The] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm-i-Istehkam” (as approved by [the] Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.
The operation came a day after the ISPR reported that four terrorists from the Fitna al Khawarij — a term used to describe the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had been killed in an IBO in Balochistan’s Panjgur district.
Karak operation
Separately, Karak police spokesman Shaukat Khan told Dawn that eight terrorists were killed and several of their accomplices injured during an IBO in Karak district. He said police moved to the area after receiving credible intelligence about the presence of terrorists in the mountainous terrain of Banda Daud Shah tehsil.
“During the operation, led by Karak District Police Officer Saud Khan, the law enforcement personnel eliminated eight terrorists in an intense exchange of fire and destroyed their hideouts in the difficult mountainous terrain,” he said, adding that Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos, backed by intelligence operatives, assisted police in effectively engaging the terrorists.
The official added that the terrorists attempted to take away the bodies of their slain accomplices, but the police effectively engaged them, resulting in an exchange of fire that lasted several hours.
Peace body member injured
Separately, in Lakki Mar­wat, a member of a peace committee was injured when terrorists attacked his house in the Abbasa Khattak area late Saturday night.
District police spokesman Qudratullah confirmed the attack, saying a group of terrorists fired rockets launchers at the house of Hamayun, a key member of the local peace body.
As a result of the attack, Hamayun sustained injuries, while other residents of the house remained unhurt. Local police, with the help of armed residents and volunteers of the peace body, returned fire and forced the assailants to flee.
The terrorists also fired at the Abbasa police post before fleeing towards the mountainous border area with Karak district. Despite his injuries, Hamayun, along with other peace committee volunteers, is expected to assist police in operations against terrorists in the area.
The attack followed a successful operation in the Takhti Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, where police claimed to have killed six terrorists, including a com­­mander identified as Nusratullah Wazir.
Security advisory
Police also issued a security advisory for police personnel, government officials, and the public in light of intelligence reports suggesting a possible subversive activity in the district.
According to the advisory issued by the District Police Officer Lakki Marwat, the TTP Teepu Gul Group, with support from the Hafiz Gul Bahadar group of North Waziristan, was planning a large-scale terrorist attack in the district. It warned that terrorists might use explosive-laden vehicles to target schools, sports activities, large public gatherings, and bazaars.

 

“The planned attack may be similar to the terrorist incident that took place in the Shah Hassan Khel area of Lakki Marwat district on Jan 1, 2010”, the advisory said.
It further stated that terrorists had begun preparing an explosive-laden vehicle and that a suicide bomber, an Afghan national, was reportedly undergoing training in Paktia province, Afghanistan.
The advisory warned that terrorists might kidnap or target police personnel and civilians, directing SDPOs and SHOs to place all police units on high alert and ensure strict checking of suspected vehicles, particularly vans, trucks, and pick-ups.

The comments, delivered during an event in Kabul, come after JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, on December 23, criticised Islamabad for striking terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Iran and for deporting Afghan refugees.
“There comes a point when refugees become a problem, but you come together to resolve it; you don’t expel people who have been living in your country for 40 years,” he said, calling on Pakistan and Afghanistan to maintain friendly relations.







A declaration from Dec 23 stated that tension “is not in the interest of either country and will only benefit anti-Islamic forces”, urging Kabul and Islamabad to resolve their issues through dialogue.







Haqqani referred to the conference on Dec 23, noting that Fazl and religious scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani “expressed their goodwill towards Afghanistan, for which we are deeply grateful to all these personalities”.
He added that “positive and goodwill statements” were also delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar regarding Afghanistan.
“If goodwill, good interaction and positive relations are established between countries, and nations are brought closer to each other, then we welcome it,” Haqqani was quoted as saying.
The interior minister clarified that Afghanistan was committed to peace, stability and security in the region and assured all parties that the Afghan people did not intend any harm or ill will against any country or nation.
Haqqani concluded his statement by saying: “We have made a firm decision to build and develop our homeland; now others should also stand by us in this process. No one should have any concerns about us.
“Afghanistan has now entered the reconstruction phase and we want other countries to be our partners on this path, and to abandon wrong attitudes and negative intentions about Afghanistan.”
Meanwhile, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi had expressed similar views while addressing a ceremony yesterday, stating: “Recently, scholars from famous madrasas and universities and religious movements and parties from across Pakistan gathered in Karachi and gave the best advice to their government.
“They made the best decisions. We respect them. We always expect that just as scholars have tried to reform systems and personalities throughout history. They tried for peace and goodness. They played a role in brotherhood and closeness; they should play a similar role in the future as well.”
Pak-Afghan tensions
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.</p><small>2025-12-29 02:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29085005b60b94e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963853/balochistan-police-chief-doubles-financial-assistance-for-families-of-martyrs' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan police chief doubles financial assistance for families of martyrs</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan police chief has announced a comprehensive and historic increase in financial assistance and welfare benefits for the families of police martyrs, serving personnel, retired employees and their children. 
Inspector General Muhammad Tahir said the welfare of police personnel and the families of martyrs was among his foremost priorities. “The sacrifices of police martyrs were a guiding light for the force. Completing their mission and easing the difficulties faced by their families and police employees is our first duty,” he emphasised. 
Under the enhanced martyrs package, immediate financial assistance for the families of martyrs has been increased from Rs100,000 to Rs200,000. Compensation for personnel seriously injured in the line of duty has been raised from Rs10,000 to Rs100,000, while assistance for those sustaining minor injuries has been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs25,000. 
The IGP said burial assistance for martyrs had also been substantially enhanced. Funeral expenses within the province have been increased from Rs40,000 to Rs75,000, while the amount for transporting bodies outside the province has been raised from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000. An additional Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 has been allocated for other burial-related needs. 

Immediate relief amount increased from Rs100,000 to Rs200,000

Marriage grants for police employees have been increased from Rs12,500 to Rs50,000. Assistance for the marriage of daughters of martyrs and deceased officials has been raised from Rs50,000 to Rs200,000, while marriage grants for two daughters of serving or retired employees have been increased from Rs25,000 to Rs100,000. 
IGP Tahir also announced an increase in monthly financial assistance for widows of deceased employees. For employees in grades 1 to 11, the amount has been raised from Rs7,500 to Rs12,000; for grades 12 to 15, from Rs8,750 to Rs14,000; and for grades 16 to 17, from Rs8,750 to Rs14,000. 
The annual allowance for police officers has been increased from Rs10,000 to Rs16,000, while for officers up to grade 18 it has been raised from Rs12,600 to Rs20,000. The annual allowance for their children has also been increased from Rs12,000 to Rs18,000. 
The IGP announced that tuition fees of children of police employees who secure admission on merit in cadet and residential colleges of Balochistan will be paid from the Police Welfare Fund. In addition, special cash prizes will be awarded to children of police employees who secure top positions in matriculation and intermediate examinations under the Balochistan Board, including Rs50,000 for first position, Rs40,000 for second and Rs30,000 for third position.

The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”.
The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.







Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.
Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy.
They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory.
“The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read.
They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”.
In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
Meanwhile, in a call with Somali Foreign Minister Abdisalam Abdi Ali, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia’s sovereignty and condemned actions undermining it, the FO said in a post on X.
“The Somali Foreign Minister thanked the DPM/FM (Dar) for standing by Somalia and for Pakistan’s continued and sustained support,” the post read. “He also sought Pakistan’s assistance in raising Somalia’s concerns at the UNSC.”
The FO said that Dar affirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia at the UN and other multilateral fora.







Similarly, in another call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty, Dar discussed regional and global developments, with Somalia and Yemen in particular, the FO said in another social media post.







For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty.
Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans.







While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”.
However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.”
“Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28155346a922711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963729/bilawal-highlights-significance-of-politics-of-reconciliation-calls-for-opposition-to-play-responsible-role' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal highlights significance of politics of reconciliation, calls for opposition to play ‘responsible’ role</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari highlighted on Sunday the significance of the politics of reconciliation, urging the opposition to play a “responsible” role and also called for the ruling party and its allies to take the necessary steps in this regard.
Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana.

         View this post on Instagram            

He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”.
Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”.
“If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting the English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”.
He added, “If you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution.“
Bilawal maintained that if the PPP had been in PTI’s place, it would have faced more severe consequences.
He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not benefit the party itself and its workers, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics.
The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation.
“From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role.
“President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said.
However, he pointed out there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances.
“The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance.
“If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.”
He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss.
In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held.
“And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that, we will have to increase people’s trust in the Election Commission.
“There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said.
Referring to the complaints regarding recent by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”.
Again highlighting the need for the opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have to take some measures.
“Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added.
Earlier in the media talk, Bilawal said that while the government had been claiming that the economy was improving and economic indicators on paper seemed to be improving, there was a “crisis of affordability” in the country.
He also said that the PPP’s views on privatisation were that a successful model in this area was that of public-private partnership.
In response to a question, he again stressed that political parties should find political means to resolve issues.
“Long-term solutions to our issues, economic difficulties and questions of national security lie in genuine political stability and in the lasting innings of one political party,” he asserted.
“And all political forces and our senior politicians should think about what measures need to be taken to establish genuine political stability.“</p><small>2025-12-28 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641921-pod-of-dolphins-spotted-in-gwadar-amid-noctiluca-bloom' target='_blank'><strong>Pod of dolphins spotted in Gwadar amid Noctiluca bloom</strong></a><br><p>
