As the law minister began presenting the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward the minister’s table. Meanwhile, Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, presiding over the proceedings, read out the amended clauses one by one for voting.

Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber.
A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House.
Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report
Naek tabled the report in the Senate earlier today. Following that, Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, pointing out that Naek would now elaborate on the reporting.
 


Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”.
Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause.
Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court.
Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added.
Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office.
Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age.
He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member.
The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.”
He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion.
As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”.
He said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then.
He said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted.
“The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was formed under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said.
Senate session begins
The Senate session began with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani.
At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches.
During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure.
His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“. He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”.
“The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued.
Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May. “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests.
“What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned.
He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”.
After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August.
Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI.
She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”.
For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment.
“Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added.
PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib.”
Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life.
He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits.
The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it.
Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm.
Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.”
‘Will ensure amendment does not pass’
Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers.
“It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media.
He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said.
However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment.
“The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity.
The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006.
Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living documents which continued to evolve.
He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices.
How many votes are required?
A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament. So when the bill is put to the vote in the Senate, which comprises 96 members, it will require the backing of at least 64 senators.
The ruling coalition has 65 votes in the Senate, with the PPP’s 26, PML-N’s 20, Balochistan Awami Party’s four, Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s three, Awami National Party’s three, one each of the National Party, Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and seven from independent lawmakers.
However, this does not guarantee the approval of the amendment bill in the Senate as these votes also include those of Gilani, who cannot cast his vote being the Senate chairperson, and PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui, whose vote cannot be ensured as he is hospitalised.
Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the National Assembly (NA), which is also scheduled to meet at 4:30pm today.
In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each.
Approval by parliamentary committees
The bill, which was tabled by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the Senate on Saturday amid outcry from the opposition and hours after getting the federal cabinet’s nod, aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant lifetime status to the field marshal rank.
On Sunday, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees had app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment bill with minor changes amid a boycott by the opposition.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and pertains to the military command structure, were amicably approved by both committees.
Senator Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments.
The committees, however, deferred the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) proposal, seeking to amend Article 140 that pertains to local governments, as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) recommendation for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The ANP had submitted a proposal to rename the province by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber was a district and other provinces did not include district names in their titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the province’s seats in Parliament was also deferred.
Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan told reporters that the committee had sought time until Monday to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, the law minister told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces would be taken into confidence on changing KP’s name.
PM shoots down immunity clause
A proposal for immunity for the prime minister was also included in the 27th Amendment bill, but Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday ordered its withdrawal, saying that the premier must remain “fully accountable”.
“On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
“While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






“As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people,” he said.
Later the same day, the premier had also hosted a dinner for senators from coalition parties at the Prime Minister’s House in Islamabad and congratulated them on the approval of the 27th Amendment bill by the joint parliamentary committee.
PM Shehbaz said he was thankful to the heads of all allied parties and President Asif Ali Zardari.
“All of us made unified efforts to strengthen the federation, in the broader interests of the country, to increase harmony among the provinces and to improve governance,“ he said.</p><small>2025-11-10 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632958-asif-dismisses-baseless-propaganda-against-pia-safety-operational-standards' target='_blank'><strong>Asif dismisses 'baseless propaganda' against PIA's safety, operational standards</strong></a><br><p>

Last week in an interview with The Riasat Azim YouTube channel, the 32-year-old pacer accused then selector and team manager Manjurul Islam and other officials of sexual harassment.
She detailed multiple incidents spanning from 2021 through the 2022 Women’s World Cup, which she said left her mentally distressed and ultimately sidelined from the national setup, according to cricexec.
Manjurul, who is currently in China, rejected the allegations as “baseless”.
According to the Times of India, BCB President Aminul Islam said on Sunday during a press briefing that the board would act firmly once the investigation concludes, adding that the committee should be given time to complete its work.
He reaffirmed that no one — be it coach, director or staff member— was above the law, nor did any position within the board hold immunity.
“Even the Prime Minister of this country isn’t exempt from such rules. We’re just ordinary directors. If I go and harass someone, and it’s proven to be true, then I’m just an ordinary director not above the law,” Times of India quoted him as saying.
The news outlet said that the board has constituted a three-member inquiry panel headed by retired Justice Tariq ul Hakim, with Rubaba Dowla, a newly appointed BCB director, and Barrister Sarwat Siraj Shukla, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, as members.
The committee has been given 15 working days to submit its report.
Meanwhile, as per a Cricbuzz report, the BCB has placed four officials linked to women’s cricket on special duty pending the inquiry.
While affirming the board’s zero-tolerance stance, Aminul also emphasised the need for a fair process.
“If the allegations are true, they will not be tolerated. But since such investigations touch upon personal lives, it can harm those falsely accused. So they should be given five to seven days to defend themselves,” he said.
The BCB’s official statement echoed the same sentiment: “The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings.”
Despite the mental toll it took on her, Jahanara said she felt a responsibility to protect the other female cricketers, who allegedly also had similar experiences but were afraid to speak up due to professional repercussions.
Aside from Manjurul, she named other BCB officials, and said that she had previously written to the board, but that no action had been taken.
Jahanara took 48 wickets in ODIs, and 60 in T20s, across 135 white-ball matches for her country.
Manjurul, 46, a former left-arm seamer, played 12 Tests and 34 ODIs for Bangladesh between 1999 and 2004, before serving in various coaching and managerial roles.</p><small>2025-11-10 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632939-ihc-orders-new-investigation-into-rs142bn-bitcoin-ransom-threat-to-malik-riaz' target='_blank'><strong>IHC orders new investigation into Rs1.42bn bitcoin ransom threat to Malik Riaz</strong></a><br><p>

The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn, that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.
The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”.
It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”.
“We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter.
“If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added.
“We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all.
The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”.
 
 

The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at
least expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”.
“At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said.
The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media.
Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan.
Zuberi, Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”.
Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, respectively.
Proposed judicial restructuring
Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly.
Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum.

At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC.
Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC.
Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court’s Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, are also being discussed for inclusion in the FCC’s initial composition.
Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the SC, senior high court judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice.
FCC judges would retire at the age of 68. The retirement age for SC judges currently is 65 as per Article 179 of the Constitution.
The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office.
The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself.
The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution“.
Moreover, the FCC would take over the SC’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the president’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.</p><small>2025-11-10 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1013432010ee909.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954268/renowned-educationist-arfa-sayeda-zehra-passes-away-in-lahore-at-83' target='_blank'><strong>Renowned educationist Arfa Sayeda Zehra passes away in Lahore at 83</strong></a><br><p>Dr Arfa Sayeda Zehra, a human rights activist, poet and education expert, died on Monday.
The author’s niece, Ameena Kamal, confirmed to Dawn that Zehra had passed in Lahore at age 83.
“Dr Arfa will be buried in her family graveyard, Cavalry Ground, Lahore, tomorrow, and the time of her funeral will be announced at a later time,” Kamal said.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “profound grief” over the educationist’s passing, the PPP posted on the social media platform X.
“The demise of Dr Arfa Sayeda Zehra is an irreparable loss for Pakistan’s academic and literary circles,” he said, adding that the intellectual had dedicated her life to knowledge, research, and service to humanity.
He said she had “set a shining example”, adding, “Her scholarly contributions and efforts for the promotion of the national language will always be remembered.”
Zardari expressed heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the deceased’s family, students, and academic community.
 






Dr Zehra was recognised for her knowledge of Urdu literature and language and served as a teacher for over 50 years. She had also been a member of the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) and served as its chairperson in 2006.

“The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s the power and…the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged on a recent podcast with OpenAI chief Sam Altman.
“So if you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can’t plug in,” Nadella added.
Echoing the 1990s dotcom frenzy to build internet infrastructure, today’s tech giants are spending unprecedented sums to construct the silicon backbone of the revolution in artificial intelligence.
Google, Microsoft, AWS (Amazon), and Meta (Facebook) are drawing on their massive cash reserves to spend roughly $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 — backed for now by enthusiastic investors.
All this cash has helped alleviate one initial bottleneck: acquiring the millions of chips needed for the computing power race, and the tech giants are accelerating their in-house processor production as they seek to chase global leader Nvidia.
These will go into the racks that fill the massive data centres, which also consume enormous amounts of water for cooling.
Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the United States; bringing new high-voltage power lines into service takes five to 10 years.
Energy wall
The “hyperscalers,” as major tech companies are called in Silicon Valley, saw the energy wall coming.
A year ago, Virginia’s main utility provider, Dominion Energy, already had a data-centre order book of 40 gigawatts —  equivalent to the output of 40 nuclear reactors.
The capacity it must deploy in Virginia, the world’s largest cloud computing hub, has since risen to 47 gigawatts, the company announced recently.
Already blamed for inflating household electricity bills, data centres in the United States could account for 7 per cent to 12pcof national consumption by 2030, up from 4pc today, according to various studies.
But some experts say the projections could be overblown.
“Both the utilities and the tech companies have an incentive to embrace the rapid growth forecast for electricity use,” Jonathan Koomey, a renowned expert from UC Berkeley, warned in September.
As with the late 1990s internet bubble, “many data centres that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built.” - Emergency coal - If the projected growth does materialise, it could create a 45-gigawatt shortage by 2028 — equivalent to the consumption of 33 million American households, according to Morgan Stanley.
Several US utilities have already delayed the closure of coal plants, despite coal being the most climate-polluting energy source.
And natural gas, which powers 40pc of data centres worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, is experiencing renewed favour because it can be deployed quickly.
In the US state of Georgia, where data centres are multiplying, one utility has requested authorisation to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators.
Some providers, as well as Elon Musk’s startup xAI, have rushed to purchase used turbines from abroad to build capability quickly. Even recycling aircraft turbines, an old niche solution, is gaining traction.
“The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change.
It’s the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don’t have enough power,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum argued in October.
Nuclear, solar, and space?
Tech giants are quietly downplaying their climate commitments. Google, for example, promised net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 but removed that pledge from its website in June.
Instead, companies are promoting long-term projects.
Amazon is championing a nuclear revival through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an as-yet experimental technology that would be easier to build than conventional reactors.
Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa in 2029. And the Trump administration announced in late October an $80bn investment to begin construction on ten conventional reactors by 2030.
Hyperscalers are also investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, particularly in California and Texas.
The Texas grid operator plans to add approximately 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2030 from these technologies alone.
Finally, both Elon Musk, through his Starlink programme, and Google have proposed putting chips in orbit in space, powered by solar energy. Google plans to conduct tests in 2027.</p><small>2025-11-10 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/10115814e44a8ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954263/uae-probably-wont-join-gaza-stabilisation-force-senior-official' target='_blank'><strong>UAE ‘probably’ won’t join Gaza stabilisation force: senior official</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is not planning to join the international stabilisation force for Gaza because it lacks a clear framework, a senior official said on Monday.
“The UAE does not yet see a clear framework for the stability force, and under such circumstances will probably not participate in such a force,” Emirati presidential adviser Anwar Gargash told the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate forum.
 
 

The US-coordinated international force has been seen as likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye, as well as the UAE.
Last week, US President Donald Trump said he expected the force to be in Gaza “very soon”, as a fragile ceasefire holds following two years of war.

In a statement, the senator’s family said that Siddiqui had been receiving treatment at a local hospital in Islamabad for the past few days due to respiratory distress.
The same was also reported by state-run Associated Press of Pakistan.
Earlier today, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry had said that the PML-N leader had been put on a ventilator after his health had worsened.
“Senior politician and important PML-N leader Siddiqui is extremely unwell. He has been put on a ventilator due to severe illness,” said Chaudhry, who is also a PML-N leader, in a post on social media platform X. He also prayed for the health of the senator.
 






The development came shortly before a session of the upper house of Parliament was slated to begin to discuss the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment. His absence in the Senate may make things difficult for the government, which needs a two-thirds majority to pass the bill.
Siddiqui is the chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the PML-N’s parliamentary leader in the Senate.
In 2019, he was arrested at his residence in Islamabad for not informing police while renting out his house under the tenancy law. He was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-11-10 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08174236263b9d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953704/cjp-yahya-afridi-a-year-in-review-or-not' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Yahya Afridi — a year in review, or not</strong></a><br><p>Eighteen years ago, Justice Yahya Afridi, the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan, teamed up with his partners and petitioned the Supreme Court (SC) against its capture by the executive. In 2007, then-chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, along with nearly 50 judges, was deposed by the Musharraf regime and forcibly prevented from holding court.
It was a first in the country, where a chief justice had been made, in the words of the official handout issued then, “non-functional”. In the chaos that ensued, Justice Afridi teamed up with his partners and petitioned the apex court against its capture by the executive.
 
 

What is happening today with the 26th and the now-proposed 27th amendments is a complete and competent challenge to what the incumbent top court judge once swore in the filing.
Even now, the encroachers are the same as they were in 2007; more brazen, though, because their handmaidens all recognise that the sell-by date on their popularity has long passed. The methods are the same; using support from within to divide and fracture the ranks.
The only thing that has changed is that instead of the brilliant lawyer that he was in 2007, Yahya Afridi is now the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
The review
When I was asked to review the first year of CJP Afridi, I thought of saying a lot that has already been said before in these pages. But then, I thought the best way to review a position is to reflect on it against itself from earlier.
In his filing in 2007, this is what Justice Afridi swore on:
On overall independence, his lordship thought: “It is the independence of the judiciary which ensures the protection and safeguard of the fundamental rights of the petitioners and the people of Pakistan.”
On the encroachment of the executive into judicial functioning, such as stopping a particular judge from working, CJP Afridi swore: “If the judiciary is subjected to the fiat of the executive, the very foundation of trichotomy of powers envisaged under the Constitution is brought to a naught.“
On the effect such encroachment has upon general fundamental rights of the citizenry, the CJP believed: “Right to access to justice for all is a well recognised inviolable right enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution.”
The fundamental right of access to justice and what it meant at its core was explained as follows by Afridi sahab: “Access to justice implies an independent judiciary which can judicially review the illegal orders of the executive.”
What happens when you capture the judiciary? Here is what 2007 Afridi said: “In the absence of an independent judiciary, right to access to justice and the very protection of fundamental rights is brought to a nullity.”
Upon harassment of a judge by those we call the executive, CJP Afridi said: “Where the executive has maligned the independence and the Honour of the judiciary by making its honourable chief Justice of Pakistan non-functional … clearly demonstrates that the petitioners and the ordinary person of Pakistan has no fundamental rights.”
On the fiddling with the working of a judge, Afridi sahab said: “Independence of judiciary is violated by impairing the working of the honourable chief justice of Pakistan illegally and unconstitutionally, which imperils the very enforcement of the fundamental rights of the petitioners and of every citizen of Pakistan.”
And lastly, when summing up the irrelevance of lawyers in a regime where the courts themselves are rigged, the honourable CJP Afridi swore: “In the absence of an independent judiciary, the petitioners’ right to practice in the courts of Pakistan for the enforcement of their fundamental rights would become impossible, hence violating Article 18 of the Constitution.”
The analysis
Some years back, a senior lawyer stepped out of the court within my earshot, frustrated by the treatment he was getting from the bench and by the indulgence being given to the counsels for the opposing side: “I represent the most respected charitable hospital in Pakistan. The opponent runs a petrol pump. Surely there is a difference.”
Although all are indeed equal before the law, the sentiment conveyed was perhaps that your reputation, your past conduct and your standing in society should count for something. The company you keep should also count for something.
The filing quoted above was sworn by Yahya Afridi in 2007. His fellow petitioner was Athar Minallah. His lawyer was Mansoor Ali Shah. All three are now judges of the Supreme Court. Surely, that should count for something. From the decisions rendered, we can safely state that two out of three firmly stand by what they said in 2007.
 
 

There was a famous food supply company whose next generation decided to refresh the ageing design of their labels. They sent it out to a celebrated advertising firm, which wrote back declining the commission with the simple comment: We cannot improve upon perfection.
The first year of Chief Justice Afridi need not be analysed with any other lens. The only things one needs to note are the improvements made to the perfection that was 2007, and the people who agree with his conduct today compared to those who agreed with him back then.

In a procedural vote, senators advanced a House-passed bill that will be amended to fund the government until January 30 and include a package of three full-year appropriations bills.
If the Senate eventually passes the amended measure, it still must be approved by the House of Representatives and sent to President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.
Under a deal struck with a handful of Democrats who rebuffed their party’s leadership, Republicans agreed to a vote in December on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies, which help lower-income Americans pay for private health insurance and are due to expire at the end of the year, have been a Democratic priority during the funding battle.
The vote to advance the bill passed by a 60-40 margin, the minimum needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.
 
 

“It looks like we’re getting very close to the shutdown ending,” Trump told reporters at the White House prior to the vote.
The bill would prohibit federal agencies from firing employees until January 30, a win for federal worker unions and their allies. It would stall Trump’s campaign to downsize the federal workforce.
Some 2.2 million civilians worked for the federal government at the start of Trump’s second term, according to federal records. At least 300,000 employees are expected to leave the government by the end of this year due to Trump’s downsizing efforts.
It would also provide back pay for all federal employees, including members of the military, Border Patrol agents, and air-traffic controllers.
When the Senate reconvenes on Monday, Republican leaders will try to get a bipartisan agreement to circumvent Senate rules and move quickly to passage. Otherwise, the chamber would require much of the coming week to move through procedural actions before voting on final passage, possibly extending the shutdown into next weekend.
“It was a good vote tonight,“ Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters after the Senate adjourned on Sunday. “Hopefully, we’ll get an opportunity tomorrow to set up the next votes. Of course, that’s going to take some cooperation and consent.”
Sunday’s deal was brokered by Democratic Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, both from New Hampshire, and Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said a person familiar with the talks.
“For over a month, I’ve made clear that my priorities are to both reopen government and extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits. This is our best path toward accomplishing both of these goals,” Shaheen posted on X.
 






Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, voted against the measure.
Many Democrats on the Hill watched the deal unfold with displeasure.
“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” wrote US Representative Ro Khanna on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?“
 






Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season late this month.
Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown pushed the chamber toward an agreement.
“Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,” Tillis told reporters.
Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS “Face the Nation” show. Thanksgiving falls on November 27 this year.
The wrangling on Capitol Hill came as Trump on Sunday again pushed to replace subsidies for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplaces with direct payments to individuals.
The subsidies, which helped double ACA enrollment to 24 million since they were put in place in 2021, are at the heart of the shutdown. Republicans have maintained they are open to addressing the issue only after government funding is restored.
Trump took to his Truth Social platform on Sunday to blast the subsidies as a “windfall for Health Insurance Companies, and a DISASTER for the American people,” while demanding the funds be sent directly to individuals to buy coverage on their own.
“I stand ready to work with both Parties to solve this problem once the Government is open,” Trump wrote.
Americans shopping for 2026 Obamacare health insurance plans are facing a more than doubling of monthly premiums on average, health experts estimate, with the pandemic-era subsidies due to expire at the end of the year.
The ACA enrollment period, however, runs through January 15, which would allow time for a legislative effort to extend the credits for next year.</p><small>2025-11-10 05:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632891-27th-amendment-bill-set-to-be-tabled-in-senate-today-after-coalition-partners-nod' target='_blank'><strong>Senate votes on 27th Constitutional Amendment amid opposition protest</strong></a><br><p>

The content of this change is not certain, nor is its direction necessarily set in stone. But what is clear is that there is some reth­in­king of history, memory, and culture taking place.
What does this rethinking mean as far as the state is concerned? A good example comes from the content of the Pakistan pavilion at the Dubai World Expo from a few years ago. We can take that content as the version that the state wishes to show to the world outside. It was decisively more syncretic and multicultural, more accommodative and reflective of ethnic difference, than standard two-nation theory nationalism. It also went a considerable way in grounding the idea of Pakistan in its actual geography, by drawing links to the various riverine civilisations that occupied these lands over several millennia, regardless of their religious affiliation.
One should be wary of reading too much into an external projection, given how the state in many ways continues to deny ethnic and religious difference and suppress history through its practice. But it’s hard to ignore that a variety of different factors have partially compelled a mild rethink of the us­­ual religion-inflected, homogenising idea of what this country really is and what constitutes its past.
Such factors include the rise of anti-state Isla­m­ist radicalism, the rise of aggressive Hindutva na­­tionalism next door, and a change in the character of the state elite into a somewhat more multiethnic coalition. Several decades of territorial integrity, post-1971, and entrenchment of national belonging in the ‘core’ provinces, has also opened space for some experimentation on a firmer footing.

What is interesting and generative of optimism is a reimagination of the past taking place within society.

None of this, though, stands in ignorance of the general hypocrisy of the state: talking about tolerance, while emboldening bigots; restoring heritage sites, while ignoring the desecration of minority places of worship in the present. These contradictions continue to exist and should be called out loudly and categorically.
What is more interesting and generative of optimism is a reimagination of the past taking place within society, well beyond formal state patronage or guidance. Digital platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram provide space for cultu­r­­al enthusiasts and pop-historians of all stripes (and, admittedly, quality). Their output usually takes the form of short-form video essays or photographs that provide narrations about physical heritage and the myriad cultural practices — religious ritual, food, music etc — that exist in Pakistan today.
Some of these outlets have crossed the digital divide and taken on offline forms. Curated walking trips in urban and peri-urban locations, heritage and nature tourism, and even culinary adventures showcasing regional cuisines, are increasingly available to urban audiences. While their small scale is not indicative of anything major or substantial yet, these developments do provide insight into how the public’s relationship to the past is neither homogenous nor settled. And it is certainly not a wholesale acceptance of what the state may have intended.
One such cultural endeavour that recently drew my attention is the work of historian and writer, Syed Faizan Abbas Naqvi in Lahore. A self-declared urban enthusiast, afflicted with what he calls “marz-i-Lahore” (an obsession of the city bordering on ailment), Faizan runs various digital outlets showcasing his adventures at various less-known, ignored, or undiscovered historical sites in and around the city.
His work involves finding bits of history all over, in places remote, such as the border villages to the east, and as mundane as parking lots, housing complexes, and markets. Through these journeys of discovery (as ‘Lahore ka khoji’), Faizan casts light on 135 different historical sites, over and above the usual grand Mughal and British-era buildings that most casual observers and residents of the city are familiar with.
This insurgent history has made its way into published form, with 100 sites now being commemorated and archived in his recently released book, Exploring Lahore, that covers pretty much the entire span of religio-cultural diversity that the city has experienced these past few centuries. For those interested in supporting such valuable work, the book is available through the author’s Facebook and Instagram pages.
Such work is important for several reasons. The first is that far too many sites of historical and cultural significance, especially those representing minority traditions, lie in dilapidated and unprotected shape. Appreciable restoration work in a few locations by WCLA notwithstanding, many sites are already lost or damaged beyond any recovery. In the course of his own documentation, Faizan identified a few sites — including a Mughal-era graveyard — that was lost to commercial development just in the past few years. Recording and archiving their existence takes on great importance in a context where their continued physical existence remains uncertain.
Another reason why such interventions are im­­portant is because they allow for creative ways in which the past can be recovered and reimagined.
Independence came with partition and the wholesale transfer of population to and from the region that became Pakistan. Partly down to the religion-inspired nature of politics, and partly because of physical dislocation, many citizens have spent their lives in an ahistorical state. The city only exists in their present, the past becomes another country.
The process of recovering the past then is also a process of making people historically aware. It is to recognise that their present is a form of shared continuity, not an insulated break. Taken to one of its logical ends, this historical grounding and app­reciation can even have the appreciable and much-needed impact of making people more accommodating and tolerant of difference in the present.

There is not a hint of remorse, not a sliver of guilt.
The interviews published by Indian outlets last week — The Hindustan Times, New Indian Express and The Hindu — or the ones by Reuters, AFP and the UK’s Independent (published on October 29) show that former prime minister, in exile in India since August 5, 2024, remains thoroughly unencumbered by even a touch of introspection or self-doubt.
Going a step further, The Week, also based in India, published a column by Hasina where she deplores the ineptitude of the very institutions her regime had meticulously destroyed. She flails against the interim government for not having the people’s mandate, which she had manufactured to stay in power for years through rigged elections. She berates the BNP for trying to manipulate the caretaker government system, which her regime had abolished. Her deluded sense of being wronged pervades the entire article.
The closest Hasina comes to acknowledging some error of her administration in the article is one that she had already mentioned in her written interviews. She writes, “I mourn the life of every Bangladeshi that has been needlessly lost since the protests in the summer of 2024. While the vast majority of law-enforcement officers acted within their guidelines, mistakes were very clearly made in the way some members of the security forces responded to the rapid upsurge of violence.”
Hasina goes on to write that it was a very fluid and “febrile situation”, and clearly there were “breakdowns of discipline within the chain of command”.
She then states, “However, the Awami League categorically rejects the allegations that we were directly responsible for, or commanded the use of, lethal force against our own citizens. To characterise what happened as a plot by a democratically elected government to commit violence against its own people is entirely wrong. Indeed, I personally took steps to ensure that no firearms were used.”
Throughout all her interviews Hasina maintains that the evidence against her, audio clips of phone calls, were either doctored or taken out of context. She also rejects the UN human rights office estimate that 1,400 people were killed during the July uprising as “inflated”.
She told in her interview with The Hindustan Times rejecting her role in the crackdown, “But to suggest that I was directing minute-by-minute tactical responses from the prime minister’s office is to fundamentally misunderstand how security forces work. I repeat, at no point did I authorise security forces to fire on crowds.”
The Daily Star’s own investigation found Hasina to have personally authorised the use of lethal weapons. This newspaper had reported on a phone recording from July 18, 2024 where Hasina tells her nephew, former Dhaka South Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, “I have given instructions, now I have given direct instructions; now they will use lethal weapons. Wherever they find them [protesters], they will shoot directly.”
The 78-year-old former leader took the opportunity to express her gratitude to India for offering refuge. “I am deeply grateful to the Indian people for providing me with a safe haven,” she said. “The connections between our two countries are broad and deep. We pride ourselves on being India’s reliable partner.”
While her interviews with the international agencies and the UK newspaper appeared to be somewhat balanced, the ones carried by the Indian outlets are far more incendiary. Sheikh Hasina’s lack of self-reproach aside, the latest round of interviews shirks from providing any context that explain Hasina’s hasty departure. There is little that sheds light on the weeks of untold violence preceding her flight. There is hardly any mention of Hasina’s 17 years of misrule when Bangladesh descended into an autocracy.
 
 

Her interviews and the writeup attempts to portray the Yunus-led government as a usurper without any acknowledgement of how the Awami League regime had fuelled discontent among the protesters as well as the general populace. The underlying message has been the next election will not be inclusive without the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, taking part.
The publication of these interviews and column could not have happened without the knowledge or consent of Hasina’s host country. Together with the former premier’s write-up, this move can only be seen as an attempt to somehow influence the ensuing election. Hasina is still seen as the one responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the July uprising alone. She would do well to remember that such interviews will not even begin to restore Awami League’s image. Her hosts would do well to remember that under the current circumstances they should refrain from activities that will further their distance from the people of Bangladesh.

Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also accompanied the federal government’s delegates, who ostensibly sought to secure the party’s support for the 27th Amendment, which is currently being piloted through parliament.
The visit came mere hours after the party issued a statement rejecting the government’s move to table 27th Constitutional Amendment in Senate.
In the meeting, which continued for around an hour, the two sides discussed the overall political situation. Sources privy to the meeting claimed the ministers had sought National Party’s support for the amendment.
The government delegation also conveyed a message from PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Earlier, in a statement issued on Sunday, NP’s central spokesperson said that since the amendment was made public, the party had held detailed consultations with its legal experts and deliberated on the matter at relevant forums.
The party, which has representation in the National Assembly, Senate and Balochistan Assembly, insisted that the proposed amendment was tantamount to weakening the spirit and structure of the Constitution.
Therefore, the party’s constitutional bodies had, by a majority decision, decided to oppose the legislation, the spokesperson said.
“The National Party will oppose the constitutional amendment,” he said.

The Federal Shariat Court, located opposite the Supreme Court building, will house the new FCC.—Tanveer Shahzad/White Star

• Constitutional Bench head Justice Aminuddin Khan among leading candidates for top slot
• Federal court will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters
ISLAMABAD: With the 27th Constitutional Amendment progressing smoothly through parli­ament, the government has begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — an institution designed to deal with constitutional interpretation and intergovernmental disputes.
Official sources said the government has initiated consultations on the composition of the new court, and Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC.
The names of Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Mus­arrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Farooq, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi from the Supreme Court, along with Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, the incumbent chief justice of the Balo­ch­istan High Court, are also being discussed for inclusion in the initial composition of the new court.
 
 

Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the president, on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint judges to the new court under the proposed amendment.
The FCC proposal has been revived in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill to streamline the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and improve efficiency in constitutional adjudication.
The government believes this initiative will ease the SC’s workload, speed up constitutional rulings, and enhance judicial independence and credibility.
The idea of a separate constitutional court was first introduced in the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by the PPP and PML-N. The CoD proposed a specialised court for constitutional matters to let the SC focus on final appeals. The idea reappeared in the 26th Amendment draft but was dropped due to opposition from JUI-F and others.
The proposal sets the Constitutional Court judges’ retirement age at 68, three years beyond the Supreme Court’s 65, to ensure continuity and attract experienced jurists.
The new court will be housed in the Federal Shariat Court building in Islamabad, while the Federal Shariat Court moves to the Islamabad High Court. This will symbolically and administratively separate the FCC from the Supreme Court and other superior courts.
The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, intergovernmental disputes between the federation and provinces, and matters arising directly from constitutional provisions. It will also be empowered to examine the legality of presidential orders, constitutional amendments, and questions referred to it by the president or the Parliament.
Judges’ profiles

• Traffic police advise motorists to use Rashid Minhas Road via Aladdin Park
KARACHI: A new wave of road closures is set to cripple Karachi once again as after the much-delayed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project turned major arteries into construction zones, the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project (KWSSIP) is bringing fresh digging, roadblocks and traffic congestion to one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares — University Road.
“The closure is necessary for laying new 96-inch and 72-inch pipelines as part of the K-IV augmentation plan,” said a senior official. “This stretch, which is roughly 2.7 kilometres long, will form part of a new network that’s crucial for improving the city’s water supply.”
Digging work has already started on a section of the University Road  between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science  and Technology (Fuuast).
The second phase will extend from Hasan Square to Nipa Chowrangi, according to project documents.
 
 

Officials have set Dec 30 as the deadline, but many remain “sceptical”, given the city’s track record of repeated delays and missed timelines.
Traffic police have suggested a diversion route via Aladdin Park, Rashid Minhas Road, to ease congestion, though officers admit that alternative roads are already under heavy pressure due to ongoing construction.
However, for hundreds of thousands of daily commuters, the Red Line’s construction has already brought endless congestion, dust and frustration to residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Johar and adjoining areas.
“It’s been years of digging and no relief,” said Abdul Maalik Atiqi, a commuter who travels daily from Gulshan-i-Iqbal to Saddar. “Now they’re closing another part of University Road. We’re trapped in a city that never stops breaking.”
“In Karachi, progress always begins with a roadblock,” said Nighat Tasneem, a daily user of University Road for her work at I. I. Chundrigar Road.
For city’s weary residents, the new closure marks yet another chapter in the city’s long saga of “development at the cost of daily life.”
Sources within the government organisations involved with the Red Line and K-IV projects admit that coordination between multiple agencies has been poor.
“This is true to a large extent — there’s a serious lack of a unified plan. One department digs up what the other has just restored,” said an official.
The K-IV Augmentation Project involves the construction of a bulk transmission and distribution system to supply an additional 260 million gallons per day of water to Karachi from the main K-IV line.
This project, funded and executed solely by the Sindh government, is a crucial supplementary initiative designed to connect the main K-IV filtration plants to Karachi’s existing water network. However, its University Road section is likely to create political fallout for the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government.
Opposition parties take PPP to task
The opposition parties have wasted no time criticising the Sindh government.
Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Monem Zafar Khan lashed out, saying the city has turned into a maze of broken roads and failed projects.
“The PPP’s so-called development means endless suffering for Karachi’s citizens,” he said.
Similarly, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders echoed similar frustration, accusing the provincial government of mismanagement and corruption.
“Every few months we hear new deadlines and new projects, but the result is the same — dust, traffic, and despair,” said Fauzia Siddiqi, the PTI spokesperson for the Karachi chapter.

The publication reported this on Thursday, citing a new directive from the Trump administration.
According to the outlet, this new directive was outlined in a cable issued by the US State Department to embassy and consular officials.
It “directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the US for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits”, KFF reported.
“The guidance says that such people could become a ‘public charge’ — a potential drain on US resources — because of their health issues or age,” the report said.
“You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable read, according to KFF. It added: “Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.”
According to KFF, the cable also encouraged visa officers to consider conditions like obesity — which it noted could cause asthma, sleep apnea and high blood pressure —  while assessing whether an immigrant could become a public charge and should therefore be denied entry into the US.
“All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable read, additionally directing visa officers to determine if applicants had the means to pay for medical treatment without financial assistance from the US government.
KFF reported that the instruction also directed visa officers to consider the health of the applicant’s family members, including children or older parents.
Tommy Pigott, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, also said in a statement: “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer.”
Separately, the official told reporters that the decision to issue a visa had always been at the discretion of an officer.
Officers are not being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, but to consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care, they clarified.
“It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official added.</p><small>2025-11-10 03:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/100812508f09b70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954179/lashkari-raisani-slams-criminal-silence-on-mines-act' target='_blank'><strong>Lashkari Raisani slams ‘criminal’ silence on mines act</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Former senator Lashkari Raisani on Sunday expressed disappointment over the unresponsiveness of political leaders to whom he had written regarding the re-approval of the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act, 2025, terming their silence on the matter “criminal”.
Talking to journalists at his Srawan House, Mr Raisani said, “Letters were sent to all heads of opposition and other parties sitting in the assemblies and outside, pointing out the efforts were underway to re-approve the controversial Mines and Mineral Act 2025, but not a single leader or party has responded so far.”
Mr Raisani, who previously served as the provincial minister for mineral resources, said he has also taken legal action, approaching a court to request a new review of the law to ensure public control over the province’s natural resources.
He said his letters urged political leaders to “play their role in safeguarding the precious minerals of Balochistan for the next generation and foil any efforts” to loot them.
He argued that Balochistan’s immense natural wealth has historically been exploited. After natural gas was discovered in Sui in 1954, it strengthened Pakistan’s economy and transformed it into an “Asian tiger,” he said.

Mr Raisani lamented that instead of benefiting the local population, the province’s resources were looted by successive federal governments, leaving 80 per cent of its people below the poverty line, according to a United Nations subsidiary report.
“We, through political movements and parties, are working to raise awareness among the people to stop the plunder of our resources,” he said.
The veteran politician noted that previous public pressure from All Parties Conferences and the provincial opposition had compelled the government to withdraw the legislation through a joint resolution.
He said Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later announced in the media that the law would be withdrawn via an executive order and reintroduced in parliament only after consultations to address its shortcomings.
“However, no copy of that executive order has been provided to any political party so far, and we have again approached the court to obtain it,” Mr Raisani said, adding that the continued silence from opposition parties rem­­ains deeply concerning.
He stressed that parliamentarians now have a responsibility to correct past legislative errors and draft future laws that protect Balochistan’s interests.
 
 

Mr Raisani stated that while other provinces’ chief ministers worked to secure their water and finances, Balochistan is only subjected to exploitation.
He warned that inaction by political leaders will lead to future generations’ disapproval. He emphasised that elected officials should prioritise citizens’ rights over anything.
“Our mission is to create public awareness and build political consciousness so that no one can again use legislation as a tool to loot Balochistan’s wealth,” Mr Raisani said.

In a statement, a PIA spokesperson also disputed claims about aircraft safety put forward by the Society of Aircraft Eng­ineers of Pakistan (SAEP), which had maintained that its personnel could not compromise on safety and airworthiness.
“The body responsible for air safety in Pakistan is the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), which regulates all airlines, including PIA, under the strictest international stan­dards and procedures. All matters concerning the use and replacement of parts, the fitness of aircraft for flight, and the routes, sche­dules, or changes thereto are under the direct purview of the PCAA and are executed only after seeking their approvals,” the spokesperson said.
 
 

Referring to images of damage to an aircraft win­dscreen that circulated on the media, the spokesperson said that the use of steel tape for curing (drying) sealant after winds­creen repair was a routine matter. But, he maintained, an impression was wrongly created that “flights were being operated with a windscreen held together by tape”.
The spokesperson also claimed that the PIA management had not taken administrative or retaliatory action against any engineer, adding that the dismissal of the body’s “self-styled” president and general secretary was the result of administrative proceedings ongoing for the past four months.
However, the dismissal letter issued to both men last week stated they had been issued notices for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media. The two men were subsequently fired after they failed to appear before an enquiry committee.

As the third order term expired on Saturday, the Punjab home department on Sunday yet again notified imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, across the province for another seven days.
The Punjab government had initially imposed the ban on Oct 8 for 10 days and then notified extensions on Oct 18, Oct 25, Nov 2, and eventually on Nov 9 for one week ban each.
The home department has extended the ban on rallies, gatherings, carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers and spreading of provocative material.
The home department in its order says review of the latest reports and threat assessments shared by law enforcement and intelligence agencies explains the threat perception to public peace, tranquillity and law and order has not abated.
Extending the ban for the fourth time, the home department asserts continuation of restrictions including assembly, gathering, procession or sit-in of four or more persons in any public place, street, road or open space; carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers as well as publishing, disseminating or display of any provocative material that may incite public sentiment or disturb inter-faith and sectarian harmony.

• Senate body to question industry on steep hikes
KARACHI: Prices of more than a hundred commonly used medicines have increased by an average of 32 per cent since February last year, after the caretaker government lifted price controls under its deregulation policy, prompting concern among officials and calls for the pharmaceutical industry to explain the steep hikes, according to officials and industry sources.
The steep rise has not only fuelled public anger but also caught the authorities off guard, as they had expected that price deregulation would promote competition and eventually bring down costs for consumers. However, the outcome appears to be quite the opposite.
 
 

The surge in medicine prices came to light through recent findings of an ongoing national survey ordered by the prime minister, following complaints from citizens, hospitals, and provincial health departments about soaring drug costs.
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, told Dawn that officials of the federal health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) had informed the committee that an overall 32pc increase in medicine prices had been observed since the caretaker government deregulated non-essential medicines in February 2024.
He added that in some cases, prices had risen by as much as 100pc, while an increase of around 50pc was recorded in several others.
Senator Chishti said the purpose of deregulation was to boost competition, attract investment and increase exports, not to burden consumers.
Industry to face questions
He noted that a 32pc overall rise in medicine prices within two years warranted corrective action.
“We have decided to seek justification from the industry in all cases where medicine prices have increased by 50pc or more,” Senator Chishti added.
“We expect to meet industry representatives next month, and if we detect any element of cartelisation by the pharmaceutical sector, we will ask the Competition Commission of Pakistan to look into the matter.”
 
 

He said the committee did not want the pharmaceutical industry to suffer and wanted it to grow, but not at the expense of patients, who were already struggling due to the prevailing economic situation.
He continued that the committee was expecting recommendations from the prime minister on the pricing of non-essential medicines.
Before deregulation, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to increase prices by up to 7pc annually in line with the Consumer Price Index under the previous pricing system.
Officials pointed out that, under this formula, prices would have risen by about 14pc over two years, far lower than the 32pc surge witnessed after deregulation.
Claims rejected
The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA), however, rejected claims of an excessive price increase. It argued that the survey reflected an average rise of about 15pc and that, if the roughly 3pc linked to the launch of new products and strengths is excluded, the actual two-year increase stood at around 12pc.
PPMA’s Tauqeerul Haq said the deregulation was a timely move that prevented the collapse of the pharmaceutical industry amid soaring input costs, currency depreciation, inflation, rising energy and labour costs, and heavy taxation over the years.
“The policy helped restart production of many previously unavailable medicines, improved their availability, and curbed the circulation of counterfeit drugs during shortages,” he added.
The pharmaceutical industry argues that deregulation was necessary as the previous controlled pricing system made production unsustainable. Even under the old system, prices could not be raised without the federal cabinet’s approval. “Whenever a proposal to raise drug prices was presented, the cabinet would usually reject it due to political pressure,” said an industry representative. “Thus, deregulation was only possible during the caretaker government’s tenure.”
While deregulation has led to an increase in medicine prices, it has had a positive impact by resolving shortages of medicines at the retail level.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, said the deregulation of medicine prices ensured abundant availability of medicines, ending persistent shortages.
He described deregulation as a necessary step to move away from centralised pricing controls that had hindered the sector’s ability to respond to rising production costs.
However, Mr Budhani noted that challenges remain for essential drugs classified as “hardship cases”.
“The real need for relief was in essential drugs, but their prices were not approved, while non-essential drugs received pricing approvals,” he said, adding that bureaucratic delays had contributed to shortages of some vital medicines.

Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”.
Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”.
Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths.

Opposition alliance announces nationwide protests; plans to observe ‘Black Day’

He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan.
“I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.”
Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law.
“Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”.
Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people.
“We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.”
Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public.
 
 

A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips.
It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana.
The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.

The session was convened today — on a Sunday in a rare move — with a one-point agenda to deliberate on the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The 26-page Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes, just hours after its approval by the federal cabinet.
Senate Chairperson Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the session today, which began with the House remembering Allama Iqbal on his birth anniversary. Later, the house also passed a resolution in relevance to Iqbal Day.
During the session, PTI lawmakers had pictures of their party founder Imran Khan placed on their desks. At the beginning of the proceedings, a PTI leader raised an objection, to which Gilani replied that as per his ruling yesterday, the senator could bring his concerns to the Senate chairman’s office.
‘You cannot force a Constitution through bullets’
Addressing the upper house of the parliament, PTI Senator Ali Zafar outlined “five points” that he said formed the basic spirit of the 1973 Constitution and were now being “punctured” in the proposed 27th Amendment.
The first, he said, was that Pakistan was a federation with autonomous provinces. Secondly, the elected parliament had authority but was bound to the Constitution. Zafar said the third point was the fundamental rights provided therein, with courts formed to protect and implement them.
Fourth pillar of the Constitution, he added, was an independent judiciary to protect people’s rights and guarantee democracy, while the fifth one was civilian supremacy.
“If you alter this balance of five pillars even slightly through any amendment, the entire Constitution will be shaken and can result in major chaos,” Zafar warned.
At one point, Senator Sarmad Ali objected to the PTI bringing framed pictures and placards, pointing out that it was against the Senate rules, at which Gilani requested the opposition to refrain from doing so.

After presenting his arguments against the proposed legislation, Zafar urged the House to reject the bill for it and invited the treasury benches for further discussions.
“We can sit and think. There are a lot of options how to reduce the pendency of cases. We are ready to talk with you to consider amendments that will benefit the people, but we will not tolerate that you harm the public,” the PTI leader said.
During his speech, Zafar stressed that the Constitution was a contract between the state and the public, with a “spirit of its own”. He added that the document was a pledge that everyone, regardless of the region they hailed from, would live according to the laws.
“When you make any change in the Constitution, it is equal to tampering with the foundation of a building, and if you make any mistake, the entire building can collapse,” he contended.
 
 

Recalling that two dictators made amendments to the 1973 Constitution that “broke it”, Zafar highlighted that even they took “a lot of time” to be passed. He added that the “real spirit” of the 1973 Constitution was restored through the 18th Amendment in 2010.
The PTI senator underscored the need for a consensus on making any changes to the Constitution, contending that consensus and a two-thirds majority were separate things. “You cannot force a Constitution through bullets.”
Arguing that the PTI represented millions of people and was rejecting the 27th Amendment, Zafar said, “Respect the mandate of the people and kindly do not vote for this amendment.”
The lawyer asserted that those bringing any constitutional amendment should be “genuinely elected”, with no personal motives or wishes to stay in power. “This parliament, in my opinion with due respect, is not authorised to pass these amendments,” he added.
Zafar also claimed that the proposed changes related to provincial shares and rights under the 18th Amendment, which were dropped in the current draft, were a “face-saving for the PPP” so certain originally intended amendments could be passed.
He said the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) under the new amendment would end the judiciary’s independence, and the president having the authority to appoint the judges could result in “selection of his choice”. He added that the increase in retirement age of FCC judges from 65 to 68 years was an “incentive for judges to become pliant judges”.
 
 

The PTI lawmaker highlighted the powers proposed for the FCC, including considering cases related to fundamental rights, and cautioned that the court not following previous judicial precedents would result in a “collapse of the system”.
Zafar further termed the provisions related to the transfer of judges without their consent as a “dangling sword” of moving them from one high court to another. “This will bring the judiciary under the executive’s total control,” he argued.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The senator also slammed lawyers citing the reason for the formation of FCC as pendency of cases, calling them “intellectually dishonest”, and asserted that the SC pendency only amounted to two per cent of cases pending across the country.
The PTI senator recalled how the parliament “systematically” reached debating the 27th Amendment today, highlighting the “slow, gradual but effective erosion of democracy and the Supreme Court”.
He then mentioned the Jan 13, 2024 verdict by a bench led by then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, which revoked the PTI’s electoral symbol a month before the general elections. He also recalled the SC’s ruling in the Article 63A case that struck down an earlier order and allowed the ballots of lawmakers who voted against party policy to be counted.
 
 

“It was as if the judiciary opened the gates for the 26th Amendment through this decision,” Zafar alleged, further claiming that the ruling coalition coerced some lawmakers to vote in 26th Amendment’s favour. The senator clarified that the PTI had never agreed to even the formation of constitutional benches, and had instead termed them “lesser of the two evils” compared to a constitutional court.
The senator then highlighted three verdicts handed by the SC’s constitutional benches — the reserved seats ruling that distributed seats earlier awarded to the PTI to the coalition partners, the order allowing the military trials of civilians, and the ruling in the judges’ transfer case to allegedly “control the Islamabad High Court”.
The upper house of the parliament broke into a loud exchange at one point, when Gilani gave the floor to PTI’s Faisal Javed to speak but a lawmaker interjected. “Who are you to say this to me when the chairman has allowed me to speak?” Javed asked.
Necessary to bring some improvements in judicial system: PML-N’s Pervaiz Rashid
From the treasury benches, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid regretted that Barrister Zafar had presented just one side of the picture, “which is likeable to them”. Zafar did not mention anything about the effort in the past to “convert the judiciary into a tool of a political party”, Rashid said.

The PML-N lawmaker said the members from the opposition benches had spoken on just one point of the proposed amendment, which pertained to the judiciary. He added that he would take it as their acceptance of the rest of the clauses of the proposed amendment.
Rashid further stated that he would have been pleased had opposition members also participated in the meetings of the standing committees so that their input would have been included in their reports and subsequently discussed in the house.
Meanwhile, PPP Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan said the PTI lawmakers were “confused”, which led to an eruption of responses from the opposition benches.
In his fiery speech, Ahsan stated that the PPP had “seen bodies” of its slain leaders, including late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, his daughter and ex-premier Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto.
“You are in the parliament, you are sitting with politicians, you are also ready to enact legislation with political individuals, but you are willing to talk with someone else only,” he said while addressing the PTI.
The PPP senator also said he wanted the opposition to take part in the meetings of the standing committees, just as they were participating in the Senate proceedings.
 






You cannot end judiciary’s independence because of past decisions: Hamid Khan
In his speech, PTI Senator Hamid Khan took exception to the manner in which the government was trying to amend the Constitution.

“Constitutional amendments are not promulgated in this manner. You first reach a consensus and then amend the constitution,” he asserted.
Khan further stated that he considered the 26th Amendment “the death of the Constitution” and the effort to promulgate the 27th Amendment was akin to an “effort to bury the Constitution”.
“Both these amendments are truly something to be ashamed of.”
He went on to say that some political parties had “complaints that when the judiciary was liberated in the true sense, it issued orders to disqualify two prime ministers”.
 
 

“But this does not mean that they (political parties) get personal […] They [shouldn’t try to] put an end to the same Constitution under which [the prime ministers] were disqualified, to bring about the end of that same judiciary that disqualified them,” he added.
Khan clarified that he understood that those decisions were “controversial to some extent” and he was not supporting those decisions. “But this does not mean that you end the independence of the judiciary because of judges’ past decisions. […] Both right and wrong decision are made in history, but they don’t become a reason to ban courts.”
He questioned that if the existing judicial system ceased to exist, “who will you go to for your fundamental rights?”.
“We are at a historical moment [at present]. And if, for any reason, […] we take a step that results in the destruction and distortion of the Constitution, all of us will have to face its consequences — those who will vote [in favour of it] and the coming generations as well,” he warned.
PTI Senator Azam Swati, addressing the Upper House with a black ribbon tied around his arm, hailed the “amazing” 1973 Constitution introduced by Bhutto and other political leaders, adding that the 27th Amendment would ruin it.
Swati contended that the Statement of Object and Reasons in the proposed bill did not even address the amendments suggested in it, terming them “vague and incomplete”. He further said that the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) had been torn into pieces, and that Articles 175 and 191 did not make up for it.
“May God give you long life, this (legislation) will bite you back one day, and you will admit that you made a major mistake,” the PTI leader said.
PTI’s Mohsin Aziz also questioned the “haste” in passing the Amendment, adding that certain “informed” individuals already knew that this legislation would be introduced.
He said most of the amendments made so far were “benign”, while certain were major such as the 13th, 18th and 25th. “So why is there a need for two amendments in just two years?” he asked.
The PTI lawmaker defended the speeches given by Zafar and Hamid, saying they were not political. “They spoke as opposition not for the sake of opposition, but for the sake of betterment of this country.”
He further said, “Do not be in haste. If there are good amendments, we will definitely sit proudly with you and agree on it.”
‘Are non-Muslims not Pakistanis?’
Balochistan Awami Party Senator Danesh Kumar also spoke during the session,  raising the question that when amendments were proposed, why did they not address the lack of minorities in the federal cabinet.
“When you were proposing amendments to Article 130 and expanding the size of the cabinet, why did you not suggest that at least one member be from the minorities?” he asked, addressing Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar.
“There are no minority members in KP or Balochistan. The only minority member here is a state minister, not a federal minister,” he added.
Kumar then mentioned that according to the Constitution, the prime minister and president have to be Muslim.
“In Article 91, it says the prime minister can only be Muslim. Are we non-Muslims not Pakistani?” he asked. “If you are bringing amendments, then amend these things.”
Later, the Senate session was adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
‘Govt’s haste calls into question the intention behind moving the bill’
Separately, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement, deploring “the manner in which the 27th Amendment to the Constitution is being tabled in Parliament”.
“The government’s haste—including the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society—calls into question the very intention behind moving this amendment bill.
“Its reported content, with numerous changes designed to reconfigure the judicial system, the office-specific concentration of power ceding more civilian space, and lifelong immunity to certain state offices, has alarmed constitutionalists, the legal fraternity, human rights defenders and many others who believe in the independence of the judiciary and the tenets of civilian supremacy in a democracy,” the statement posted on X said.
It added that the  HRCP planned to hold an urgent consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to examine the proposed amendment and its “far-reaching impact on the country’s polity and society”.
 






Meanwhile, Karachi Press Club (KPC) President Fazil Jamili posted on X that the “ rushed 27th Amendment through Parliament, lacking the meaningful consultation, is deeply alarming“.
“We at KPC deplore the proposed judicial reconfiguration, concentrated power, and lifelong immunity, which gravely threaten the independence of the judiciary and civilian supremacy,” he added.

According to state-run APP, the premier hosted a dinner for the senators — a development that came after the standing committees on law and justice of both houses of Parliament approved the proposed legislation earlier today.
The bill for the amendment, which has been criticised particularly over its clauses pertaining to changes in the judiciary and Article 243 (command of the armed forces) of the Constitution, was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry. Prior to that, the PM had held several meetings with the representatives of the allied parties with the proposed legislation on the agenda.
According to the APP report, addressing his guests today, the PM said he was thankful to the heads of all allied parties and President Zardari.
“All allied parties fully backed this national thought,” the report quoted him as saying. He further stated: “All of us made unified efforts to strengthen the federation, in the broader interests of the country, to increase harmony among the provinces and to improve governance.”
The premier said that all the “milestones” achieved by his government were a result of the coordination with the allied parties.
“Pakistan’s diplomatic successes are a reflection of harmony and unity among the allied parties. It is because of our unified efforts that Pakistan reached a great position,” he said.
He maintained that the country’s economic situation had been improving and Pakistan was now “moving in the right direction” due to political and economic stability.
He stressed the need to work together for the country’s progress.</p><small>2025-11-09 19:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632840-pm-shehbaz-lauds-coalition-partners-for-backing-27th-amendment-consensus' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lauds coalition partners for backing 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands.
In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna-al-Khawarij) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/Fitna-al-Hindustan) elements present on Afghan soil.”
 
 

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.”
The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.”
Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.
The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action.
“Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.”
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control.
“More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated.
“[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.”
The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.”
The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.”
The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s.
Narratives and propaganda
The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy.
“Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression.
Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan.
“It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read.
“More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.”
‘Strong lobby’
The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”.
“In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read.
“These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.”
Border clashes and talks
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.
However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”</p><small>2025-11-09 12:51</small></div><hr>
