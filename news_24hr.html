He told Dawn that an improvised explosive device was used in the blast that took place in the Paniyala area, which is in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab Khan police station.
ASI Gul Alam, Constable Rafiq and the driver of the mobile van, Sakhi Jan, lost their lives in the incident, the police spokesperson said, adding that another constable accompanying them, Azad Shah, remained unhurt.
He said the site of the incident had been cordoned off and a search operation was launched.
“Police are searching for the attackers, and the matter is being investigated from all angles,” he said.
The Paniyala deputy superintendent of police and station house officer, as well as the district police official (DPO), also reached the site of the blast after the incident, according to the police spokesperson.
Separately, a statement issued by the office of DI Khan DPO Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada said that the attack was carried out by “unidentified terrorists”.
The statement said the DPO also spoke to the media, saying: “The terrorists have carried out a cowardly attack. Such acts cannot dampen the morale of police.”
Meanwhile, a statement issued by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi’s office said he strongly condemned the attack and termed it a “cowardly and brutal act”.
The statement said Governor Kundi expressed grief over the martyrdom of three policemen in the incident, paid tribute to them and termed them “heroes of the nation”.
He extended condolences to their families and expressed solidarity with them. the statement added.
It further quoted the governor as saying: “Their (the martyrs) sacrifices will always be remembered.”
“The sacrifices of police and security forces will not go in vain, and the struggle for peace in the province will continue at all costs. Such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the strong and unshakeable resolve of the nation against terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s people and institutions are united for the elimination of the menace of terrorism,” he said.
There have been several incidents of attacks on law enforcers in the recent months in KP, as Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism.
The country witnessed a surge in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Today’s attack on police comes around two weeks after the targeting of a police mobile with a bomb in DI Khan on November 20. Two cops were martyred and four were injured in the incident.

Speaking at an event in Islamabad, Dar said, “Multilateralism is under assault and the institutions of global governance are often criticised for the acts of omission and commission of a few states driven by unilateralist impulses.”
Referring to the four-day conflict with India earlier this year in May, Dar said, “In 92 hours, the Indo-Pakistan war had the potential to escalate to far more dangerous levels.”
He said that states had increasingly resorted to the use of force to settle disputes while disregarding international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
The deputy premier noted that “emerging technologies, transnational terrorism and hybrid warfare, including misinformation campaigns, continue to challenge stability”.

 

Dar said that India and Pakistan were “involved in a conflagration” that would have gone toward an “uncontrollable escalation”, adding that an “uneasy and fragile peace persists”.
“Pakistan demonstrated both in resolve and capability to thwart aggression and reinforce deterrence. The concept of a net security provider is buried,” he asserted.
The foreign minister pointed out that “major power competition is a defining feature of our times”, with military, technology, trade, tariff and resource rivalries intensifying.
However, the deputy PM said, Pakistan “opposed bloc politics and zero-sum approaches and consistently stressed the imperative of cooperation rather than confrontation”.
“We have underscored the indispensability of dialogue and diplomacy, of peaceful settlement of disputes, and of international cooperation and solidarity.”
As an elected member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2025-2026 term, Pakistan was “engaged in vanguard efforts to promote international peace and security”, Dar highlighted.

 

Dar also noted that the rise of extremist ideologies, political populism, democratic backsliding and Islamophobia were “negatively impacting the globe and causing upheavals in unprecedented ways”.
“Pakistan envisions a South Asia where connectivity replaces divisions, economies grow in synergy, disputes are resolved peacefully in accordance with international legitimacy and where peace is maintained with dignity and honour,” Dar said.
“We remain ready to work with all willing partners to help South Asia realise its immense potential,” the deputy premier affirmed.
‘War-fighting notions in nuclearised environment’
Speaking further on South Asia, Dar said the region had a complex security environment as it comprised “three geographically contiguous nuclear powers with complicated relationships”.
“Major regional states boast of some of the largest armed forces in the world. There is a continuous buildup of conventional and nuclear arms and regular induction of destabilising weapons systems.
“Strategic stability is delicate, among other things, by some dangerously ill-conceived war-fighting notions in the nuclearised environment,” he added.

 

Pointing out that sustainable peace had eluded South Asia for the past 78 years, Deputy PM Dar said there were “escalating disputes” over resource sharing, particularly on river waters, as exemplified by India’s illegal and unilateral announcement on the Indus Waters Treaty” in April.
“There are pervasive interstate differences and some of the longstanding unresolved political disputes, like Jammu and Kashmir, continue to threaten the peace and stability in the region,” Dar highlighted.
“Sustainable peace in South Asia, however, requires more than maintaining strategic stability,” the foreign minister said, emphasising that a just and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute remained essential.
Dar stated that the structured dialogue process between India and Pakistan has remained stalled for over 11 years.
“Other South Asian states have had their share of the see-saw relationship with our neighbour India,” he said.

 

“Burden of history, trust deficit, impulses of dominance and hegemony; domestic, political and electoral calculation; rise of populism and hypernationalism; and an ideological inclination for territorial expansionism add multiple layers of complexity to the regional landscape,” the deputy PM added.
He went on to highlight that the Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at China’s containment assigned the role of the net security provider to “one state in the region”, and that “friction” between it and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which was focused on connectivity, impacted the regional states’ efforts for peace and development.
‘Are we doomed to remain mired in confrontation and conflict?’
Deputy PM Dar also detailed various challenges that South Asia faces, including poverty, inequality, illiteracy, disease, malnutrition, income disparities, food insecurity, natural disasters and the impacts of climate change.
The region fares terribly low on most human development indices. South Asia also remains poorly integrated economically, with intra-regional trade hovering around 5 per cent,” he said, adding that the region was energy-deficient.
“Regional connectivity is woefully inadequate,” he said, pointing out that South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) — the only region-wide platform for economic cooperation — had “largely remained inactive for over a decade”.

 

Dar asked: “We South Asians need to think really hard. Are we doomed to remain mired in confrontation and conflict while other regions progress and prosper?
“The answer should be a clear ‘no’. The cumulative challenges of regional security, economic fragility and climate crisis are simply too grave to disregard.”
The deputy PM asserted that these challenges could not be tackled in an environment of “political fragmentation and fractured regional architecture”.
“To begin with, we must overcome zero-sum mindsets and foster an environment of dialogue, peaceful coexistence, economic interdependence and win-win cooperation,” Dar said.</p><small>2025-12-03 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637124-winter-chills-grip-karachi-as-temperature-drops-to-single-digit' target='_blank'><strong>Winter chills grip Karachi as temperature drops to single digit</strong></a><br><p>

The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in one of aviation’s greatest enduring mysteries.
Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.
Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.

 

Kuala Lumpur said in a statement it “wishes to update that the deep-sea search for (the) missing wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will be resuming on 30 December 2025”.
Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity will be conducting the search in a “targeted area assessed to have the highest probability of locating the aircraft”, the ministry said.
The latest search in the southern Indian Ocean was suspended in April as it was “not the season”.
It was conducted on the “no find, no fee” principle as Ocean Infinity’s previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year.
An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean over three years but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
The ministry said the latest development underscores its commitment in “providing closure to the families affected by the tragedy”.
Relatives of the victims had voiced hope in February that a new search could finally bring some answers.
When contacted by AFP, relatives of victims were not immediately available for comment.
Aviation mystery
The plane’s disappearance has long been the subject of theories — ranging from the credible to outlandish — including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.
Investigators said in the 495-page report that they still did not know why the plane vanished and refused to rule out that someone other than the pilots had diverted the jet.
Relatives of passengers lost on the flight have continued to demand answers from Malaysian authorities.
Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy in March on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance.
Attendees of the gathering shouted, “Give us back our loved ones!”, with some holding placards asking, “When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?”</p><small>2025-12-03 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637119-no-civil-military-rift-govt-dismisses-rumours-surrounding-coas-cdf-notification' target='_blank'><strong>No civil-military rift: Govt dismisses rumours surrounding COAS, CDF notification</strong></a><br><p>

A native son of this sinking coastline, Umer’s offhand remark captures the tragedy that has unfolded here: entire settlements swallowed, rebuilt, and swallowed again as sea intrusion becomes an unrelenting fact of life.
His words carry an unspoken warning: the Arabian Sea is advancing. And in this fragile delta at the tail-end of the Indus Basin Irrigation System, it has already forced whole communities to uproot and retreat.

Keti Bunder, a once bustling seaport that lies in Thatta district, was once the glittering capital of Sindh. Historical accounts place Thatta at the centre of power from the 14th to 16th centuries, until the arrival of the Mughals. The late Ghulam Mohammad Lakho, who headed Sindh University’s history department, once told me that Thatta served as the capital under the Soomro and Samma dynasties (1335–1520), and remained a port city well into the 18th century. He often quoted the Persian author Mir Tahir Nasyani, who wrote: “The people of Thatta never experienced hunger when it basked in economic prosperity.”
Umer Baloch, too, grew up on stories of a thriving Keti Bunder. It was the same historical memory that resurfaced during the Musharraf era, when then-chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim proposed reviving Keti Bunder as Sindh’s third seaport. But today, the town faces a different fate including collapsing farmlands, migration, and the slow violence of a sea inching inland.
“The city was known for its rich agricultural landscape,” Umer tells me from behind the counter of his small grocery shop, lit only by a solar panel because electricity is unreliable here. Like many residents of Keti Bunder, he has turned to the sun for power.
The turning point came as the Indus began to thin. Freshwater flows declined, and the sea began to eat its way in. “Sheher iss se pehle aagay hota tha,” he explained, recalling that the town used to lie further ahead. Entire communities, their homes and their businesses, have been pushed inland repeatedly by sea intrusion, forcing them to rebuild their lives on shrinking land.
The conversation is joined by Ghulam Hyder Channa, a small farmer who grows vegetables and cultivates paddy. “The destruction of our region actually began after 1964,” he said. “We once received freshwater throughout the year.”
Wheat, sugar cane, bananas, and the famed varieties of red rice were once staples of undivided Thatta’s fields. But as river flows dwindled, and floodwaters became rare, arriving now only during the monsoon or extreme climate events (like the ones recorded in 2025), the entire landscape transformed.
Channa noted that a rice factory operated in Keti Bunder until 1955 — a reminder that this was once a region dominated by rice cultivation, a water-intensive crop. Today, such mills have largely shifted to upper Sindh or to traditional rice belts like Tando Mohammad Khan.

A port town being undone
“We are living through a crisis,” Hyder lamented. “Imagine the prosperity of a place where people once had enough to offer milk as a soft drink.” Fifty years ago, he added, massive river flows posed the biggest challenge to those living along the banks. “Now it is saline seawater that is swallowing our land.”
Even the road leading into Keti Bunder, he said, acts like an informal dyke. “Water used to stay three to four feet below the road. Now it touches the edges twice a day, rising and falling with the sea.”
Keti Bunder taluka (an administrative unit comprising a number of villages) comprises 31 revenue Dehs. Of these, official figures show that 114,208.32 acres are now under the sea. Collectively, 170,199.39 acres out of 212,752.24 acres across Thatta’s three talukas — Keti Bunder, Mirpur Sakro, and Ghora Bari — have fallen prey to an ever-advancing sea.
Sujawal district mirrors this decline. It also has three talukas: Kharochhan, Shah Bunder, and Jati. According to revenue records, 85 of its 257 Dehs have been overtaken by the sea.
In Kharochhan alone, 400,000 acres out of 595,091 acres (29 of 32 Dehs, or 67 per cent), are under water. In Shah Bunder, 518,895 acres out of 735,706 acres (43 of 92 Dehs, or 46pc) have been lost. Jati taluka fares no better: 405,000 acres out of 879,373 acres (47pc of its land, spread across 13 of 133 Dehs) now lie beneath seawater.
These are not just disappearing revenue units on paper. Each submerged Deh represents uprooted families, forced relocations, and the erosion of entire coastal communities along with their livestock (their only sources of livelihood). Over the years, this encroaching seawater has also contributed to a steep decline in the Indus Delta’s mangrove forests.
“I remember people cultivating red rice in Deh Shahpur Dhakan Wari in the Keti Bunder area. We had to move to Deh Doolho Chholani in 1999 after the catastrophic cyclone,” recalled 70-year-old Haji Mohammad Murugur. “It wasn’t just red rice, even gidra (watermelon) was grown here back then.”
His community member, Fateh Baloch, believed the road connecting Kharochhan once served as a natural dyke. “Without it, the groundwater turned brackish because of sea intrusion into the aquifer,” he said. The advancing seawater, he added, ultimately forced their caste fellows to abandon their homes in Deh Shahpur Dhakan Wari and shift to Deh Doolho Chholani.
Until recently, residents of Keti Bunder relied almost entirely on tanker-supplied drinking water. Relief came only after the intervention of the area’s Sindh Assembly member, Haji Ali Hassan Zardari, regarded as a powerful minister due to his proximity to the sitting president, who initiated a long-delayed piped water project.

“We are getting water supply now,” said Abdul Wahid Memon, chairman of the Keti Bunder union council. He explained that the previous supply line had long been damaged. “Sea intrusion is the main reason the network keeps collapsing. The seawater cuts through the land, creating small creeks and destroying the pipeline. The original line was laid during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s era,” he said, referring to the PPP founder who contested elections from this region in the 1970s.
According to Wahid, drinking water had become an unaffordable luxury for many households until recently. “As the sea kept advancing, the pipelines corroded and became unusable, so a completely new network had to be installed,” he stated. Water storage ponds have now been rebuilt, and he claimed that “regular supplies are finally reaching every household in Keti Bunder.”
The delta that’s slipping away
Mangrove forests have long been an essential part of Pakistan’s coastal belt, but their decline over the past couple of decades has been stark. In recent years, however, large-scale replantation efforts under various Sindh government initiatives have begun to reverse this trend. These projects have not only revitalised degraded ecosystems but also enabled the government to tap into the global carbon credit market. So far, they have generated around $40 million in carbon credit sales, with projections indicating even greater revenue in the years ahead.
Experts such as Naseer Memon, a consultant on climate change-induced natural disasters who has written extensively on Sindh’s water crises, trace the delta’s ecological collapse to the decline in sustainable flows during the kharif season and to upstream Indus projects that have diverted critical freshwater away from the delta.

“In the past, the Indus would experience a low flood annually and a medium flood every third year. That pattern sustained the delta,” he explained. “But those flows have now drastically diminished.” As a result, estuaries and creeks have begun shrinking, undermining ecosystems and accelerating mangrove loss. “It was the post-Tarbela era, I believe, that set the stage for irreversible damage. The degradation reached its peak over the next 40 to 50 years,” he noted.
An estuary is the wide part of a river where its waters meet the sea, creating mudflats formed by the silt the Indus carries. When the river once brought historic volumes of water, mangroves flourished. But as those flows reduced, so did the mangroves. “These muddy lands are the natural home of mangroves in the river’s estuary. This process is becoming increasingly rare, with only a handful of creeks still receiving enough Indus water to carry it out to sea. That is why the government’s recent carbon-credit project has been launched in a very limited area,” Naseer explained.
He cautioned that we must not lose sight of the mushrooming housing societies and widespread land reclamation along Karachi’s coast. This unchecked infrastructure boom has resulted in bulldozed mangrove belts, while the city’s polluted industrial discharges into the sea have become a major driver of their degradation.
Still, he viewed the Sindh government’s carbon-credit initiative as a step in the right direction, given the rapid decline of green cover in the delta. “We must scale this up, even if the world is still debating it,” he said. To him, it is a model worth replicating in clean energy too as it is an area where Sindh has significant potential.


Under a Sindh Forest Department project, mangroves have been planted in Keti Bunder and are showing significant growth

According to the Sindh Forest Department, four species of mangroves survive in the Indus delta — about 90pc are Avicennia marina, with much smaller shares of Rhizophora mucronata, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Ceriops tagal. Of the delta’s roughly 600,000 hectares, the Forest Department administers 280,470ha (693,000 acres), Port Qasim Authority oversees 64,400ha (159,000 acres), and the Sindh Board of Revenue controls 255,130ha (630,000 acres).
The department acknowledged that the delta’s mangrove ecosystem has been severely degraded in recent years driven by rising coastal populations, overexploitation of resources, industrial pollution, and, above all, the acute shortage of freshwater as the Indus is diverted inland for agriculture. Historically, abundant freshwater and nutrient-rich sediment fuelled a thriving ecosystem. But as the river’s discharge has steadily reduced, the sediment supply to the mangroves has fallen with it, eroding the ecological foundation of the Indus delta itself.
But beyond the environmental strain, an equally striking change has emerged in the way this coastal town keeps its lights on. Keti Bunder is perhaps the only town in Sindh that has effectively bid farewell to the conventional electricity grid.
“We are no longer dependent on traditional power supply from the utility,” said Wahid, referring to the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) network. “In fact, Hesco staff removed the transformers in our area during Imran Khan’s government because of outstanding dues,” he recalled.
In the aftermath, residents collectively shifted to solar energy. “Now almost every household in Keti Bunder runs on solar power,” he said. The town’s relatively mild temperatures, moderated by coastal winds even in peak summer, mean that air conditioners are rare, allowing solar systems to meet daily needs comfortably.
A rare reprieve for Pakistan’s mangroves
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched its report, Assessment of Mangroves in Pakistan, at the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.
The report’s summary stated that it documents changeed in Pakistan’s mangrove cover from 1980 (the baseline year) to the present. It noted that mangroves were heavily exploited in the past for fuelwood, timber and animal fodder. The construction of irrigation structures on the Indus River, particularly the Kotri Barrage in 1955, had major negative environmental impacts on mangroves due to the drastic reduction in freshwater and fine sediment flows reaching the lower Indus delta.


Newly grown mangroves along the Keti Bunder coastline

According to the IUCN report, the first large-scale mangrove rehabilitation efforts began in the 1990s, when 17,100 hectares of mangroves were planted in the delta under a World Bank–supported project using propagules brought from Miani Hor. Continuing mangrove rehabilitation and afforestation efforts have since led to a remarkable increase in mangrove cover, by roughly 300pc in less than 30 years, in both Sindh and Balochistan. The latest mangrove area data indicate that cover increased to at least 285,000ha in 2022, with projections suggesting a total of up to 345,000ha by 2027–2030.
The 2025 monsoon season, now at its end, brought intense flooding to the upper regions, particularly Punjab. However, for the Indus Delta, this deluge carried an unexpected reprieve. Downstream flows at Kotri remained unusually robust, according to an irrigation official, with nearly 30 million acre-feet of water surging past the barrage between April and September, driven by swollen eastern rivers.
As this lifeline finally reached the sea, it rekindled hope across fishing communities from Kotri to Thatta, where livelihoods are tethered to the river’s pulse. For many, the return of the palla fish was simply evidence of what steady flows can restore.
And yet, this may be too little, too late for Haji Umer and the hundreds of thousands like him who have seen this cycle repeat time and again for at least the last five decades. What Keti Bunder needs is a holistic plan for its revival — one that involves steady river flows all-year round, but which appears increasingly unrealistic given the sporadic nature of the water flows courtesy a combination of climate change and bad infrastructure development.

The mounting tension between the provincial and federal governments appears to have reached a critical point. Recent statements by some government ministers indicate that the option is being seriously considered.
Any such move would plunge the country deeper into crises, with far-reaching political and security consequences. The shrinking democratic space in the country has already created a volatile situation and the ongoing politics of confrontation could derail the entire system. Can the country, which is facing multiple internal and external security challenges, afford such a reckless action?
Among the reasons cited by the federal government for this potential move are security and governance problems in KP. It may be true that the strategically located province is facing perhaps its worst security challenge in a decade, with terrorism claiming hundreds of lives, but the main responsibility of this worsening security situation lies with the federal government and security establishment. The pretext of bad governance is equally spurious with conditions in the other provinces hardly enviable.
It is all about power politics and pushing the PTI government in KP to the wall. For over a year now, the establishment-backed federal government has done everything it can to destabilise the PTI government that still enjoys a dominant presence in the KP Assembly, despite being denied its share of reserved seats for women and the minorities.

Any move to impose governor’s rule in KP could plunge the country further into crises.

With a new and more hard-line chief minister now at the helm, the confrontation between the provincial and federal governments has come to a head. The potential imposition of governor’s rule in the province reflects the desperation of the hybrid set-up that has failed to subdue the provincial government. But any drastic action against an administration that still enjoys popular support will unravel the situation in a region experiencing rising militancy and war-like conditions on the western border.

 

Most alarming is the growing alienation of the local population with the state, particularly in the districts most affected by militancy. There is a complete breakdown of administrative control in these areas because of the prevailing tension between the provincial government and the establishment — a situation which ends up providing greater space to the terrorist groups now operating with impunity. The recent attack on the FC headquarters in Peshawar shows the growing capacity of these groups to carry out such audacious strikes even in a high-security zone.
Who is to be blamed for this security failure? Certainly not the ill-equipped and highly demoralised civilian law enforcers. The growing trust gap between the state and public has been a major factor in the virtual collapse of security in the province.
Moreover, comments by the ISPR head on a ‘political-criminal nexus’ have been widely interpreted as linking the provincial political leadership with militant and criminal groups, contributing to perceptions of the establishment being involved in the Islamabad-Peshawar face-off. This can end up widening the trust deficit instead of uniting the people against an existentialist threat and give the impression of a state estranged from its own people.
The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and terrorist sanctuaries based in the latter country have directly affected KP. The province has a long border and ethnic-based connections with Afgha­nistan. Thus, the mounting Pak-Afghan tensions have a direct bearing on KP politics and society. The closing of the borders has massively affected business and trade in the province. But have the state institutions and federal government recognised these concerns of the local population?
While one can dispute the PTI’s position on dealing with Afghanistan’s backing of the TTP, the stance of the provincial government over the forced expulsion of those Afghan refugees who were born and/or lived in this country for almost three generations is not unreasonable as is being portrayed by the federal government. In fact, the government’s arbitrary decision to expel them and the closure of trade has turned Afghan public sentiments against this country, which, in turn, has been exploited by the Afghan Taliban administration.
There is an urgent need for the establishment and the federal government to review their Afg­han policy. Certain public statements made by the defence minister and some other Pakistani officials using strong language for the Afghans has not only infuriated the people across the western border but also many Pakhtuns in this country.
But the root of the confrontation lies in the diminishing democratic space and rising authoritarianism in the country. With the curbing of judicial autonomy through constitutional amendments, the government has closed the doors for any judicial recourse against extra-constitutional actions by the hybrid set-up. Denying incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan his constitutional right to a fair trial and not allowing him to meet his relatives and lawyers despite court orders has further fuelled the politics of confrontation between the centre and the KP government. The party in the province has now been taken over by the younger generation and more assertive elements who are not willing to accept the regime’s undemocratic actions.
With the establishment of a separate and evidently pliant constitutional court, the federal government now feels confident that its unconstitutional and undemocratic actions will not be struck down, thus making it easier to impose governor’s rule in KP. There seems to be no idea in powerful circles about the public reaction that such a move could trigger in the province.
The federal law minister appeared to defend governor’s rule, referring to it as a constitutional choice and not martial law. But the denial of democratic rights and the high-handedness of some powerful quarters is being regarded as no less than that. Suspending the provincial government would exacerbate public discontent, further destabilising the country.

The pause applies to people from 19 countries that were already subjected to a partial travel ban in June, placing further restrictions on immigration — a core feature of US President Donald Trump’s political platform.
The list of countries includes Afghanistan and Somalia.
The official memorandum outlining the new policy cites the attack on US National Guard members in Washington last week, in which an Afghan man was arrested as a suspect. One member of the National Guard was killed, and another was critically wounded in the shooting.
Trump has also stepped up rhetoric against Somalis in recent days, calling them “garbage” and saying “we don’t want them in our country.”
Since returning to the office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.
The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on National Guard members suggests an increased focus on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for his policies.
The list of countries targeted in Wednesday’s memorandum includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which were subjected to the most severe immigration restrictions in June, including a full suspension on entries with a few exceptions.

 

Others on the list of 19 countries, which were subjected to partial restrictions in June, are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
The new policy places a hold on pending applications and mandates that all immigrants from the list of countries “undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats.”
The memorandum cited several recent crimes suspected to have been committed by immigrants, including the National Guard attack.
Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the organisation had received reports of cancelled oath ceremonies, naturalisation interviews and adjustment of status interviews for individuals from countries listed on the travel ban.</p><small>2025-12-03 04:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692f8f5b7c1d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958893/undermining-the-federal-compact' target='_blank'><strong>Undermining the federal compact</strong></a><br><p>BARELY had the ink dried on the 27th Ame­ndment that talk of the 28th began. Were it to be passed, the much-discussed 28th amendment would purportedly strip away constitutional protection for provincial shares under the seventh NFC award. This fits a long-standing agenda: the PML-N, the PTI, the establishment and international lenders have all argued that Islamabad needs a larger slice of the divisible pool. But to revisit the vertical distribution of resources through opaque bargaining, arm-twisting and political engineering is not a technical tweak. It strikes at the core of Pakistan’s federal compact and carries grave implications for provincial aut­o­nomy, federal cohesion and human development.
Supporters of the proposed amendment adv­ance three main arguments. First, they say the seventh NFC award shifted an unduly large share of the divisible pool to the provinces without a matching transfer of expenditure responsibilities. Second, they argue that easy access to federal transfers has created a ‘moral hazard’, thus dulling incentives for provinces to broaden their tax base. Third, they accuse provincial governments of wasteful and politically motivated spending on salaries and discretionary development schemes, with little improvement in public services.
Some of these concerns are not entirely without merit. In Balochistan, for instance, the development budget is formulated and implemented almost entirely on the basis of political considerations. Over time, development spending has become deeply inefficient, with members of the provincial assembly exercising sweeping control over the public financial management cycle and allegedly using development funds for corruption, patronage and narrowly targeted goods rather than for strengthening public services. Similar practices can, in varying degrees, be observed in the other provinces as well.
However, Pakistan’s fiscal woes predate the seventh NFC Award. Cutting provincial allocations will not, by itself, resolve them. The deeper problem lies in stagnant productivity, a narrow and weakly documented tax base and the failure to build institutional capacity for capturing emerging sources of revenue. Admittedly, both the federation and the provinces have underperformed in expanding the tax net. Tax-to-GDP ratios for both tiers of government have fallen in recent years, reflecting deeply ingrained structural weaknesses.

 

Nor can Pakistan afford to squeeze social spending further. The country already trails regional peers on key human development indicators. Cutting the provincial share would directly undermine their capacity to invest in education, health and social protection. Experience suggests that when more resources are channelled to the centre, they tend to fund defence and elite-centric subsidies rather than classrooms and clinics. Smaller provinces such as Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa already devote a large share of their budgets to security, including allowances to federal law enforcement agencies called in aid of civilian forces. In Balochistan, for instance, spending on law and order is now believed to exceed that on both school education and health, and has grown far faster than either in the years since the 18th Amendment. Further cuts to the provincial share of the divisible pool would push human development even further down the list of national priorities.

Rather than curtailing transfers, a more promising approach is to redesign the fiscal framework to reward performance.

Rather than curtailing transfers, a more promising approach is to redesign the fiscal framework to reward performance. The introduction of outcomes-based indicators in horizontal distribution criteria could better incentivise improvements in both provincial revenue mobilisation and socioeconomic indicators. By linking a portion of fiscal transfers to improvements in key social indicators and to credible fiscal effort, the proposed amendment would directly address the moral hazard built into unconditional transfers while keeping decision-making closer to citizens. Provinces that broaden their tax base and deliver better results in social sectors can be incentivised to receive a larger share of incremental resources.
Inefficiency in provincial spending, meanwhile, does not automatically justify a return to centralised control. There is no assurance that federal spending on social sectors is more efficient, equitable or insulated from patronage. Islamabad’s own development portfolio has often been criticised for weak fiscal discipline and politically motivated projects. The limited impact of development spending reflects a patronage-driven political economy that operates at both the federal and provincial levels. The recent IMF report underscores these systemic governance weaknesses and persistent corrupt practices. Recentralisation would simply reproduce these distortions at the centre while weakening provincial ownership of service delivery.
Additionally, there is a dire need for the federal government to withdraw from areas the Cons­titution has already devolved. The fiscal squeeze is aggravated by Islamabad’s insistence on retaining large ministries and programmes in sectors such as health and education whose mandate, after the 18th Amendment, should largely be limited to coordination. Similarly, the federal government also spends significant resources from the federal PSDP on projects of a ‘provincial nature’. A 2023-24 review by the Planning Commission revealed that provincially oriented projects accounted for one-third of the total federal PSDP. The centre also finances devolved subjects outside the PSDP through vertical programmes such as polio, adding to its burden. Islamabad is thus attempting to perform tasks beyond its constitutional remit and then citing fiscal stress as justification for clawing back provincial shares.
As talk of a 28th amendment gathers pace, parliament must weigh the long-term consequences of diluting or removing constitutional protections for provincial finances. The seventh NFC award and the 18th Amendment were crucial steps towards a workable federal compact. Fiscal engineering, from levies (petroleum) kept outside the divisible pool to tweaks in sales tax, has already eroded provincial trust. Unpicking that settlement through contentious constitutional fixes would be a serious mistake. A sounder course is to reform tax policy, enforce discipline on federal and provincial spending, and embed performance-based criteria in the NFC formula as well as inter-organisational resource allocation.

Published in Dawn, December 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-03 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958896/in-words-only' target='_blank'><strong>In words only</strong></a><br><p>NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq seems to have taken serious affront to combative remarks made by Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, which the former criticised on Monday as “irresponsible and provocative”. To recap, Mr Achakzai is said to have made a statement challenging the proceedings of the House and suggesting they could be disrupted by public pressure.
As custodian of the House, Mr Sadiq responded sharply, asserting that “It is my responsibility to protect parliament”, and stating that “such thinking and statements must be collectively discouraged to ensure parliament’s supremacy, preservation of the constitutional system and protection of democratic traditions”, according to remarks paraphrased in a recent news report. Thankfully, the matter did not go beyond verbal sparring, and Mr Sadiq prudently blocked voting on a proposed resolution condemning Mr Achakzai’s statement and seeking his disqualification, though he allowed it to be read out.
Yet a broader question arises: is the sanctity of parliament something to be invoked only rhetorically, or is it ever to be upheld in practice as well? Consider, for example, the way the National Assembly is being run. After losing their erstwhile leader in August to a May 9 case, the opposition had collectively nominated Mr Achakzai as its representative leader in the House. Instead of honouring the nomination, however, Mr Sadiq has refused to notify Mr Achakzai as opposition leader, and on Monday quickly interrupted when Mr Achakzai was described as such, saying he, as Speaker of the House, did not recognise him in that capacity.
It does not behove the Speaker or his office to thwart the opposition in this manner. It has been widely speculated that certain quarters view Mr Achakzai as ‘undesirable’ for his political stance. The Speaker’s apparent acquiescence in this view does little to enhance the credibility of his office or the standing of parliament.

 

Consider also the manner in which parliament has legislated sweeping and far-reaching changes to Pakistan’s laws in recent years. Many would agree that there was very little that was dignified about the manner in which the 26th Amendment was passed. The same can be said for the 27th. When an institution repeatedly described as ‘supreme’ is perceived as playing more of a validating role, it can hardly expect the genuine respect its office-bearers demand for it.
The opposition, too, must reflect on its conduct. The main opposition party seems preoccupied with its jailed leader: its representatives show very little care for their responsibilities as public representatives and remain fixated on a single-point agenda. A parliament distracted by personal battles and narrow agendas cannot hope to command public respect. The people deserve a legislature that takes itself seriously. If our elected representatives expect dignity for parliament, they must first demonstrate it through their own actions.

KARACHI: The widespread outrage that the tragic death of a child, who drowned in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Nipa, ignited has intensified, with political parties, civil society, and celebrities demanding answers, asking: “Who is responsible for this?”
Three-year-old Ibrahim fell in an uncovered manhole in front of a departmental store near Nipa on Sunday evening. The body was recovered after a 15-hour-long rescue operation on Monday.
By Tuesday evening, the manhole and the connected drain that had been dug up by rescuers to retrieve the body remained open, posing a threat to people.
Many parties held protests against the provincial administration on Tuesday and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign.

Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts

A lawyer moved a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan Town chairman, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and Red Line contractor over their alleged negligence.

 

Another lawyer filed a petition before the Sindh High Court for a judicial inquiry.
Protests continue
The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday staged a protest near Nipa against Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the Sindh government of Pakistan People Party (PPP) over the incident that claimed the life of the three-year-old a day earlier.
The protesters carrying placards and banners chanted slogans against the PPP government and demanded the mayor’s resignation.
Senior party leader and opposition leader in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin said Karachi had been “bleeding for long” and another innocent life had now been lost.
Those responsible, directly or indirectly, should be nominated in the FIR, he said, urging the Sindh chief minister to take serious action.
Also on Tuesday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders visited the area near Nipa and pointed out that the manhole was yet to be covered. They strongly condemned the inaction of the PPP-led provincial set-up and municipal authorities and demanded that lids be placed on all uncovered gutters across the metropolis.
Meanwhile, the Karachi Restoration Movement (KRM) demanded that an FIR for the alleged killing of Ibrahim be registered against the mayor.
Speaking at a press conference outside the KMC head office, KRM leaders said that as mayor — the “custodian and father of the city” — he must be held responsible.
They announced that their protest camps would continue across the city in mourning for Ibrahim and other children who had died in similar incidents, and that their campaign would continue until a case is registered and the mayor resigns.
Lawyers move courts
A lawyer on Tuesday filed an application before a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan town chairman, KWSC and the contractor of Red Line project over their alleged negligence.
Applicant Advocate Sheikh Saqib Ahmed filed the application under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code and submitted that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people have lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes.

 

He stated that after incident, he approached the Aziz Bhatti SHO for lodging an FIR under Section 322 (qatl-e-bis-sabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the proposed accused persons but the police refused to register the case.
Meanwhile, another lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the same incident by a district and sessions judge.
Petitioner Gulzar Nigar also sought directives for the mayor and all 25 town chairmen to file detailed reports about uncovered manhole trenches and pits in the city.
The petitioner also asked the SHC to further direct the respondents to formulate and implement a city-wide municipal safety and hazard prevention framework.
Social media outrage
Many X users framed Ibrahim’s death not as an unfortunate mishap, but as the latest example of systemic failure in the city.
One post captured the sentiment bluntly: “Imagine taking your child shopping and walking out with empty arms because the street itself swallowed him… This isn’t an ‘accident’; it is state-engineered negligence. Every open manhole in Karachi is a death trap waiting for another Ibrahim.”
Actor Mahira Khan called out “unimaginable apathy” after watching a “video of a mother helplessly screaming, crying for her baby”. All she could ask was, “Who the hell is responsible for Karachi?”
Sajal Ali criticised the city’s crumbling infrastructure and “collapsing, failed system”, saying she couldn’t imagine the parents’ pain as they waited for a miracle that never came because “there was no one to save him”.
She added that Karachi “carries the weight of millions yet receives no care in return”.
Adnan Siddiqui blamed the authorities who “couldn’t be bothered to cover a manhole”, calling the tragedy a “simple, preventable act of responsibility” and the indifference “as if human life means nothing here”.
Rapper Talha Yunus said, “My heart weeps and my blood is boiling; this is all the result of our government’s incompetence. 2026 is almost here and this is the state of our city. Curse you,” he said, offering condolences to the family.
Naumaan Ijaz also questioned the government’s priorities, saying, “Cameras worth millions have been installed [to give out] e-challans, but manhole covers were not installed to save someone’s life.”

At least 465 people were killed, according to disaster officials, with another 366 missing.
Sri Lanka’s Air Force has been combing the landslide-struck landscape, surveying the damage and ferrying food and other essential supplies to marooned residents. Tho­ugh the rain has stop­ped, recovery has just begun.

 

As the first journalist for foreign media to join a relief mission over the tea-growing region, photographer Ishara Kodikara saw a swathe of the country destroyed after slips of soil flattened everything in their paths, including roads and the vehicles that were on them.
The roof of some houses peaked through the mud, while the rest of the buildings were swallowed by the torrents of soil unleashed by Cyclone Ditwah.
Jagged tears in the mountainsides revealed churned-up expanses of earth, with a few patches of the lush vegetation still clinging nearby in stark contrast. There was no sign of human life in the wrecked landscape.
In the central Welimada area, now inaccessible to heavy vehicles, rescue workers pulled 11 bodies from the mud on Monday and appealed for help to search for dozens more.
In some places, entire slopes have been sheared away, leaving ochre wounds slicing through the dense plantation greenery.
The full extent of the damage to tea plantations, factories and tea pickers is not yet clear, but local media reported the industry has been hard hit. What were once thick, unbroken canopies of tea are now wide channels of mud and debris.

KARACHI: The city commissioner has informed the Sindh High Court that all milk samples collected from Karachi were found unfit for human consumption by the Pakistan Standards & Quality Control Authority.
The report, which was submitted on behalf of the commissioner, also said that presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples indicated extensive adulteration.
It also maintained that there was no justification for any increase in the price of fresh milk particularly due to decline in consumption of milk related products in winter.

 

Citing the department of agriculture, supply and price, the commissioner and others as respondents, a petition was filed in 2023 by a dairy farmer impugning a notification about the official price of fresh milk fixed in October 2023.
A report on behalf of the commissioner of Karachi was placed before a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry in compliance with the last court order.
The report said that the impugned notification as well as subsequent notifications were issued for revision of milk prices after due deliberations with all relevant stakeholders and in pursuant to court directives, various meetings were convened with all stakeholders to finalise milk prices.
However, it maintained that the hygiene practices and safety standards followed by wholesalers/farmers/retailers were hazardous to human health.
The report also said that an exercise of the quality checking of milk samples were conducted across the city on the request of a milk retailer association and the same were sent to the PSQCA for sampling.
“After testing, the PSQCA declared all the samples unfit for human consumption. In the meeting held on 20.11.2025, a representative of the PSQCA stated that due to unhygienic practices adopted by farmers, wholesalers and retailers, the milk was found unfit for human consumption. He further noted that the presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples, indicates extensive adulteration”, it added.

 

The commissioner in his report further stated that in order to address the issue of adulteration, the milk sellers’ associations were instructed to formulate joint Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure proper hygiene and safety practices and the same were prepared and submitted to the commissioner office on Nov 25.
It maintained that in a meeting held on Nov 20, a representative of the bureau of supply & prices observed that there was no justification for any increase in milk prices at this stage particularly in view of the seasonal decline in the consumption of milk-related products in winter and anticipated that the prices were likely to decrease in the coming month.
Subsequently, the report also said that a fresh notification was issued on Nov 27, fixing the maximum retail price of fresh milk at Rs220 per litre and all the associations were instructed to adhere to the notified rates, maintain proper measurement practices and ensure quality strictly in accordance with the SOPs.
The bench in its order noted that since no one was present for the petitioner to dispute such reports, same were taken on record.
Earlier, the petitioner had stated that he was aggrieved by a notification issued on Oct 3, 2023 whereby milk price in a certain way per litre had been fixed by the provincial authorities which was less than the actual price as per formula devised by the government itself.
In May, the bench had directed the commissioner to consider representations/applications of all the stakeholders, including the petitioner, and provide them a fair and proper hearing and fix the milk price in Karachi in accordance with law and the formula already in existence within a period of one month.
Disposing of the petition, the bench had also directed the commissioner to file compliance report after one month through member inspection Team-I of SHC for perusal in the chamber.

The prime minister said this while presiding over a meeting of the working group on tax reforms. The huddle was part of a series of meetings held with the private sector experts’ working groups for national economic reforms, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.

 

During the meeting, PM Shehbaz said the government held the tax-paying businesses and companies in high regard, adding that only strong businesses and a robust economy could generate tax revenues.
“We desire to make business environment in the country better and more competitive through long-term measures. Since day one, the government has been taking practical steps for export-driven economic growth,” he added.
Ministers Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­ammad Aurangzeb, Ali Pervez Malik, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar and senior officials attended the meeting.
Chairman of the Working Group, Sheh­zad Saleem, also attended the meeting.
The meeting was given a comprehensive briefing on tax rates in various sectors, including the corporate sector.
Proposals regarding necessary tax ref­orms to support private sector developm­ent, increase exports and promote investment in the country were presented.
Recommendations were also shared on enhancing the competitiveness of the country’s business sector in the region.
The prime minister also expressed his gratitude to private sector experts for presenting comprehensive proposals, hinting that after due consideration, he would be forming a committee headed by the finance minister to make these proposals actionable.

ISLAMABAD: A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday sought relevant record from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) regarding the law degree of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan resumed the hearing of a petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood. Representatives of the legal fraternity, along with amicus curiae Barrister Zaffarullah Khan, also appeared before the bench.
During the proceedings, the petitioner urged the court to summon the academic record directly from Karachi University (KU), contending that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri had been cancelled by the university. The Sindh High Court (SHC), on a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri, had suspended KU’s order regarding the degree’s cancellation.
Chief Justice Dogar observed that since the HEC was the regulatory authority for universities, the bench would first examine the record provided by the commission before issuing any notice to KU.
The court also passed the direction to the HEC to appoint a senior officer for court’s assistance.
At this stage, a representative of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) drew the court’s attention to the council’s pending application seeking to become a party to the case. The bench assured the representative that the application would be considered and taken up in due course. The matter was subsequently adjourned.
The case has undergone a complex procedural trajectory since it first came before the court on September 16, when the same division bench initially took up the matter. At that hearing, the bench issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be examined.
The decision — issued without prior notice to the respondent — prompted considerable debate within the legal community.
The Supreme Court later intervened, and on September 29 set aside the IHC’s restraining order. A five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan held that no high court could bar a sitting judge from performing judicial duties by granting interim relief.
The apex court emphasised that its ruling was confined to the legality of the interim order and did not touch upon the underlying merits of the petition.
During proceedings before the Sup­reme Court, Attorney General for Paki­stan Mansoor Usman Awan acknowledged that the petition raised an unprecedented legal question, as quo warranto proceedings against sitting judges were exceedingly rare.
He referred to the 1988 Malik Asad Ali judgement, in which the SC held that judges could not be rest­ra­ined from judicial functions through int­e­rim orders. The SC then asked the IHC to decide the objections raised to the petit­ion and proceed in this matter accordingly.

Criticising the rulers, he said a parliament formed through stolen mandates, money or influence had no authority to alter the basic structure of the Cons­t­i­tution.







Mr Achakzai was speaking at a public meeting held at Ayub Football Stadium on Tuesday to mark the 52nd death anniversary of Shaheed Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai. Leaders of various political parties attended the gathering and paid tributes to Khan Shaheed for his struggle against colonial rule, his efforts to strengthen democracy and work for people’s rights.

 

The PkMAP chief, who also heads the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), alleged that in order to secure a majority, state repression was unleashed against the PTI.
He claimed thousands of homes were raided, workers were tortured in police stations and detention centres, and even their dignity was violated. “Despite this, the public gave PTI the mandate, but instead of counting votes, candidates who came third or fou­rth were declared winners through tick-marking, while others were given victory in exchange for millions,” he alleged.
He added that when a majority still could not be achieved, opposition members were disqualified en masse through court rulings and their seats handed to the “fake government.”

“All six militants who attacked the FC fort have been killed by the security forces in the clearance operation,” officials said.
The militants barged into the compound on Sunday night after a suicide bomber detonated herself at the main gate of the fort. Security officials said they had killed three armed men instantly, while three managed to enter the building and take hostages.
The local residents said that the firing stopped on Tuesday morning, after which the authorities stated that the remaining assailants were killed in the late-night operation.
By the time this report went to press, there was no statement from the military’s media wing about the number of casualties in the attack.

These documents were signed during the ongoing visit of a Turkish delegation led by Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alparslan Bayraktar that had engagements with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik and Power Minister Awais Leghari on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Sharif witnessed the ceremony for the exchange of MoUs and agreements between Turkiye and Pakistan in the field of petroleum exploration, including the deed of assignment for Eastern Offshore Indus-C, the Petroleum Concession agreement Ziarat North Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Sukhpur-II Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Deep C block and the Offshore Deep F Block.







The premier underscored the historic and fraternal ties between the two nations and expressed satisfaction at the positive trajectory of bilateral relations and a strong desire and commitment to further expanding cooperation, particularly in the energy sector.

Companies reach exploration pacts for three offshore and two onshore fields

Mr Sharif and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed in June 2022 to expand bilateral trade to $5bn in three years from $1.1bn in 2021. The bilateral trade stood at $1.4bn in 2024.
He also emphasised the importance of expanding collaboration between Pakistan and Turkiye in the energy, petroleum, and mineral sectors, according to an official statement, noting with satisfaction that Turkish Petroleum had joined offshore and onshore exploration activities in Pakistan, marking a major milestone in bilateral energy cooperation.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to Turkish companies to increase their investment footprint in Pakistan’s energy market and called for the need to ensure close coordination between the two nations in view of the fast-evolving regional and global environment. The two sides agreed that a ministerial delegation from Pakistan will visit Turkiye soon to explore further cooperation in these fields.
The Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar informed the hosts that Turkiye was planning to develop additional ventures in partnership with Pakistan, particularly in oil & gas exploration, energy infrastructure, and the mining sector. “To achieve our shared goal of $5 billion in bilateral trade, significant contributions will come from deeper collaboration in energy and mining,” the visiting minister said.
He recalled his participation in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Conference early this year and noted Pakistan’s vast mineral potential. “That is why I have brought a Turkish mining company with me,” he said. “It is a milestone for Türkiye to enter the mining sector with Pakistan, and we look forward to building long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships”, he was quoted as saying.
Managing directors of Mari Energies, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) gave detailed presentations on their ongoing and planned projects and highlighted promising opportunities for Turkish counterparts for collaboration in oil and gas exploration, including those in shale gas and tight gas and mining and minerals, through joint venture and technology partners.
The visiting delegation also informed Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik that the office of Turkish Petroleum will be opened in Islamabad this month, where ten Turkish nationals will be working along with local staff. The two sides agreed to explore the concept of adopting a unified approach by incorporating a joint trading company for the procurement of petroleum to meet their respective energy requirements.
Both sides agreed to enhance investment facilitation and expand collaboration to unlock the full potential of Pakistan-Turkiye energy cooperation, according to the statement.
During these interactions, Power Minister Awais Leghari also invited Turkish experienced and reputable international private-sector investors in the bidding as Pakistan prepares for the privatisation of the first three Discos, an Expression of Interest for which will be invited shortly.

ISLAMABAD: Amid stiff opposition from both sides of the aisle, parliament on Tuesday passed by majority vote a bill to establish a statutory body to protect and promote the rights of minority communities in the country.
The opposition was based on fears that a provision giving the law an overriding effect would affect the anti-Ahmadiyya ordinance promulgated in 1984.
A motion seeking leave of the House to take up the bill for immediate consideration was opposed by around one-third of the members present in the joint sitting. A total of 160 members voted in favour of the bill while 79 opposed it.







The bill was, however, passed with certain amendments, including the omission of the clause giving it overriding effect and a change to withdraw the suo motu powers earlier proposed for the National Commission for Minorities’ Rights.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the bill amid outcry from some members, particularly those belonging to the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
However, Mr Tarar made it clear that the bill would neither dilute the anti-Ahmadiyya provisions nor affect any court judgement. “Neither the law nor the Constitution, nor our conscience, allows us to make a proposal that contradicts the Holy Quran and Sunnah,” he remarked.
He said the Constitution and the state had declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, but they did not accept this and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the bill. He said that when the decision declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims was challenged, the Supreme Court had held that the protection under Article 20 of the Constit­ution was not available to those who did not recognise their non-Muslim status.
The minister said four amendments had been suggested to the original draft and these had been incorporated into the proposed legislation. Saying that minorities were defined as “non-Muslims” in the Constitution, he added: “This is a commission for non-Muslims. Our Hindu, Christian and Parsi brothers are as good Pakistanis as we are.”
Mr Tarar recalled that a 2014 Supreme Court judgement had called for the constitution of a commission for minorities. The matter had landed in the joint sitting after around 10 years, he added, before the debate on the bill began. He underlined that the proposed commission would not have punitive powers and would instead send its recommendations to the government.
“Our Christian, Hindu, Parsi, Sikh and other non-Muslim brothers and sisters deserve a forum to address issues — whether forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights or other matters of dignity,” he said.
Presidential assent
During the debate, PTI Chairman MNA Gohar Ali Khan pointed out that the bill had come to the joint session after the president returned it without giving his assent and with certain objections. “It should be seen why the president did not give his assent to the bill,” Mr Gohar said.
He pointed out that the president had objected to the proposed procedure for the removal of the chairperson and members of the commission on the pattern of superior court judges, as well as to the proposed powers of the commission to create and upgrade posts and maintain independent accounts.
The PTI chairperson also objected to Section 35 of the bill, a point further elaborated on by JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza. He said the section stated that the legislation would have an overriding effect. This meant that, being the more recent law, the bill under consideration, once approved, would have precedence over all previous legislation.
He said the provision should be omitted from the bill in its entirety. Moreover, he also objected to Section 12 of the bill, which he said gave suo motu powers to the commission to be established under the proposed legislation.
“On the one hand, you are taking away suo motu powers from courts. And on the other hand, you are giving this power to commissions,” he said, apparently referring to the recent 27th Amendment that curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers. If these two provisions were omitted, he said, “we could say that this is acceptable”.
Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also participated in the debate, saying: “We are here today to give some people their rights, to legislate so that they get more rights.”
He said that at present the biggest issue in Pakistan was the violation of fundamental and civil rights. “There is democracy, (and) you are presiding over a session where there is no opposition … It is not a good sign.”
As he went on to express his grievances on this matter, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq interrupted him and asked him to confine his remarks to the bill.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also stated that the Pandora’s box of Ahmadis, who were declared non-Muslim in 1974, should not be opened again. He pointed out that the law minister himself had stated that Ahmadis were non-Muslims and did not follow the Constitution. “But at the same time, I will ask the minister that he should also be aware of the past tricks of Qadianis,” he said.
He also expressed concerns regarding the recently passed 27th Amendment and other legislation passed by the ruling coalition.
Lamenting that no one was taken into confidence regarding the amendment, he stressed that the legislation “will remain controversial”.
Noorul Haq Qadri of the PTI endorsed the position taken by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He also suggested that the bill be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP also opposed the bill.
Proposed commission
According to the bill, the proposed commission will include representatives from all provinces and minority communities, promoting inclusivity and effective oversight. There shall be a council of the commission to be established under this act. The council shall exercise all powers, perform all functions and do all acts and things assigned to it by the commission.
It shall consist of 18 members, including three Hindu members (of whom two shall be from the scheduled castes); three Christian members; one Sikh member; one member from the Bahai community; one member from the Parsi community; two Muslim members with a human rights background; one representative from each provincial human rights or minorities affairs department; and one minority member from Islamabad Capital Territory.
Upon the commencement of this act, or whenever required thereafter, the National Assembly Secretariat shall, within 60 days, initiate and complete the process for appointing the chairperson.
A four-member parliamentary committee is to be constituted by the National Assembly speaker after consultation with the Senate chairman, consisting of two members from the Senate, preferably non-Muslims, and two members from the National Assembly, also preferably non-Muslims. If the parliamentary committee fails to take a majority decision, the prime minister will appoint the chairperson of the commission.
The joint sitting also passed the National Assembly Secretariat Employees (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (Implem­entation) Bill 2024, the Pakistan Institute of Management, Sciences and Technology Bill 2023, the National University for Security Sciences, Islamabad Bill 2023, and the Ghurki Institute of Science and Technology Bill 2025.

The 70-year-old pope spoke to reporters on the plane at the end of his visit to Turkey and Lebanon — his first trip outside of Italy since becoming head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics in May.
Leo said anti-Muslim sentiment was “oftentimes generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.” He said his visit to Lebanon was intended to show “that dialogue and friendship between Muslims and Christians is possible”.
Leo said stories he heard during the trip of Christians and Muslims helping each other were “lessons … that we should perhaps be a little less fearful”.

The pontiff urges halt to attacks in Lebanon as first trip abroad ends

The US-born pope spent two decades in Peru as a missionary within the Augustinian order.
He has been critical of growing nationalist sentiment in Europe and the United States, and has called for an end to the “inhuman treatment” of migrants under US President Donald Trump.
He has also exhorted followers to reject an “exclusionary mindset” that he said had led to nationalism around the world.
Leo has said the Catholic Church “must open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race”.
A 150,000-strong mass at Beirut’s waterfront was the highlight of the trip by the head of the world’s Catholics, who arrived in Lebanon on Sunday after visiting Turkey, the start of his six-day trip.
Before landing in Rome on Tuesday afternoon, the 70-year-old pontiff told journalists aboard the papal plane that he looked forward to his next international trip, which has yet to be officially confirmed.
“I hope to make a trip to Africa, which would possibly be my next trip to confirm,” he said, adding that he hoped to visit Algeria “to visit the places where St Augustine lived”.
He also mentioned “Latin Amer­ica, Argentina, Uruguay” as possible visits.
In Lebanon, the US pontiff received a jubilant welcome in a nation beset by a years-long economic collapse and which is still reeling from last year’s war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, with many fearing renewed hostilities.
Noting that he was unable to visit all of the country, Pope Leo expressed his “aspiration for peace, along with a heartfelt appeal: may the attacks and hostilities cease”.
Israel has continued to launch stri­­kes on Lebanon despite a Nove­mber 2024 ceasefire with Hezbollah and has escalated attacks in recent weeks — but has not announced any raids during the pope’s visit.
Under heavy pressure, Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming the Iran-backed group, which, however, has rejected the idea.
The pope appealed in his mass “to those who hold political and social authority here and in all countries marked by war and violence. Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace”.
He said that “the Middle East needs new approaches to reject the mindset of revenge and violence, to overcome political, social and religious divisions, and to open new chapters in the name of reconciliation and peace”.
Later, as he prepared to depart from Beirut airport, he declared, “While weapons are lethal, negotiation, mediation, and dialogue are constructive. Let us all choose peace as a way, not just as a goal!”
Before the service, the pope prayed at the site of a catastrophic port explosion on August 4, 2020, which killed more than 220 people, injured over 6,500, and devastated swathes of the capital.
Near a monument to those killed, with the facility’s devastated grain silos visible nearby, the pope spoke with survivors and relatives of victims, many of whom were holding photos of their loved ones.
“I was deeply moved by my brief visit to the Port of Beirut,” the pope said from the airport.
“I carry with me the pain, and the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country,” he added.
Nobody has been held to account for the Beirut port blast, one of the world’s largest ever non-nuclear explosions.
Cecile Roukoz, a lawyer whose brother died in the explosion, expressed gratitude for the pope speaking up for the victims.
“We need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,” she said.

The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Faisal Rat­h­­ore late on Monday, also decided to provide Rs2.9 billion in equity to Bank of AJK to help it obtain the scheduled-bank status from the State Bank of Pakistan, establish women police stations at divisional headquarters, and fix the number of administrative departments at 20.
Among other key decisions, the cabinet approved uniform domestic and commercial power tariffs for 5kV and 60kV consumers, waived Rs139 million in outstanding electricity dues, and sanctioned the establishment of education boards in Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot.
The cabinet decisions were shared with the media by Senior Minister Mian Abdul Waheed and Minister for Forests Sardar Javed Ayoub on Tuesday.
Mr Ayoub said the government would initiate the health card scheme immediately after finalising an agreement with State Life Insurance. A committee led by the health minister would identify hospitals and submit its report within five days, he added.
On education reforms, he said staff shortages would be addressed under a rationalisation formula of one teacher per 25 students. New posts would be created where required, while surplus teachers would be shif­ted within the same union council. Institutions would also be upgraded or newly established on a need basis.
A separate committee headed by the higher education minister wou­ld present its recommendations on the revival of student unions within five days. He said a finance minister-led committee would also submit proposals within five days to reduce taxes on property transfers. 
A committee has also been for­m­­ed for the rehabilitation of Mangla Dam-affected families, which would submit its report within five days, after which land allotment for the affectees would begin.
The cabinet further approved a revised scheme for the Revenue Complex in Muzaffarabad, the launch of solid waste management projects in nine district headquarters, and procurement of machinery for the Communications and Works Department in Poonch.
Projects earlier cleared by the Cabinet Development Committee (CDC) also received approval. These included the 500kW Pathyali and 500kW Haryala hydropower projects in Muzaffarabad, costing Rs495.305 million and Rs499.250m, respectively, and the 220-metre Gulpur bridge in Kotli at a cost of Rs824.369m.

Five Chinese citizens have been killed and five wounded near the border in the past week as a result of attacks launched from Afghanistan.
Tajik President Emomali Rahmon held talks with the heads of his security agencies on Monday about the situation and China has advised its citizens, who are engaged in various mining and business activities, to urgently leave the border area.
One of the three sources, in the Tajik Security Council, told Reuters that the authorities have held talks with Russia about the possibility of deploying forces from Moscow’s military base in the Central Asian country to jointly patrol the Tajik-Afghan border.
The base is Russia’s largest overseas military facility and is located close to the Tajik capital, Dushanbe.
“We are currently in talks. I think a decision will be made … this week,” the source told Reuters.
Two of the other sources, in Tajikistan’s State Committee for National Security, confirmed the talks with Russia, which, if successful, would see Russia use helicopters to help patrol the 1,344-kilometre border with Afghanistan, which runs through mountainous terrain.
The Tajik and Russian ministries of defence declined to comment when asked about the talks.
The Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation alliance, which the sources said was also involved in the talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 

The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have said they will cooperate with Tajikistan on security issues around the border.
In a call with his Tajik counterpart, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi expressed regret and said Kabul was prepared to boost coordination between border forces, adding that “joint measures against malicious elements are a pressing necessity.”
“The Islamic Emirate is fully prepared to strengthen border security, conduct joint investigations, and engage in any form of coordination,” Muttaqi said, according to a statement from the Afghan foreign ministry.
He added that “an atmosphere of trust” had recently developed between the two countries and should not be undermined.
Until the early 2000s, the Russian base, along with Russian border troops in Tajikistan, was tasked with guarding the Tajik border with Afghanistan. Tajikistan has been independently guarding the frontier since 2005.</p><small>2025-12-02 20:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02232414c6ccac6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958807/if-europe-wants-war-with-russia-we-are-ready-putin' target='_blank'><strong>If Europe wants war with Russia, ‘we are ready’: Putin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia was “ready” for war if Europe seeks one, accusing the continent’s leaders of trying to sabotage a deal on the Ukraine conflict before he met with US envoys.
The comments came as United States envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner were in Moscow for high-stakes talks on ending the nearly four-year war, which were preceded by days of intense diplomacy.
“We are not planning to go to war with Europe, but if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now,” Putin told reporters in Moscow.
“They have no peaceful agenda, they are on the side of war,” he added, repeating his claim that European leaders were hindering US attempts to broker peace in Ukraine.
He added that European changes to Trump’s latest plan to end the war “aimed solely at one thing — to completely block the entire peace process and put forward demands that are absolutely unacceptable for Russia”.
Washington has presented a 28-point draft to end the conflict, later amended after criticism from Kyiv and Europe, which viewed it as heeding to many of Russia’s maximalist demands.
The plan to end the war is championed by Trump, but European countries fear it risks forcing Kyiv to cave in to Russian demands, notably on territory.
Fearing further Russian aggression, Europe has repeatedly said an unfair peace should not be imposed on Ukraine.
The Trump envoys are now seeking to finalise the plan with the approval of Moscow and Kyiv.</p><small>2025-12-02 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/022235035c0c684.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958806/afghan-man-arrested-in-texas-threatened-suicide-attack-justice-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan man arrested in Texas threatened suicide attack: Justice Dept</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan man has been charged in Texas with threatening to build a bomb and carry out a suicide attack, United States officials said on Tuesday, as the Trump administration vows a crackdown on Afghan migrants after a deadly shooting.
Mohammad Dawood Alokozay, 30, of Fort Worth, allegedly made the threats in a November 23 video that he shared on TikTok, X and Facebook, the Justice Department said in a statement.
In the video, Alokozay allegedly praises the Taliban and threatens to carry out a suicide attack on Americans.
“Thanks to public reports of a threatening online video, the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force apprehended this individual before he could commit an act of violence,” FBI Dallas special agent in charge Joseph Rothrock said.
Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Alokozay “came into America during the Biden administration and, as alleged, explicitly stated that he came here in order to kill American citizens”.
He faces up to five years in prison if convicted of making a threatening interstate communication.
Alokozay’s arrest comes a week after the shooting near the White House in Washington of two National Guard members.
A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the attack, which left one of the soldiers dead.
Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and entered the United States as part of a resettlement program following the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
US President Donald Trump said Sunday his administration intends to pause asylum decisions for “a long time” after the shooting.

Prison authorities had allowed her to meet the former prime minister today. She was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as Uzma went inside the prison to meet her brother.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
The meeting took place under strict supervision and without mobile devices, she added, declining to provide further details.
In a separate talk with the media, flanked by Aleema Khanum and PTI leaders, Uzma said: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”
She added the PTI founder was even more disturbed when informed about the treatment meted out to his sister, Noreen Niazi, a few weeks ago.
Uzma said Imran also gave a message to the party to support the candidates nominated by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja and Hamid Khan for the Pakistan Bar elections, along with ensuring that Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were notified as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
She further said Imran had also tasked the PTI with supporting and following any call by the two nominees for the opposition leaders. Uzma added that Imran further directed that Shahid Khattak be made the parliamentary leader of the opposition.
“About Sohail Afridi, he said that he is very happy and supports him completely.”
In a strict warning for PTI members seen fraternising with those from the government, she said Imran gave one direction: “My party members who play on both sides of the wicket have no place here and are the Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq of my party.”
Meanwhile, Aleema announced the party’s future course of action, saying the sisters would now sit outside Adiala every Tuesday and would not move until six family members and just as many lawyers were allowed to meet Imran. Party members would continue their own sit-in every Thursday, she added.







The development comes following the PTI’s protests outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Adiala jail today against restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights. The party had claimed that the ex-premier’s family and party leaders had been denied access to him for the last several weeks.

According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was imposed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi ahead of PTI’s protests. It is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
Tallal’s warning
Earlier today, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that compliance with Section 144 would be ensured in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“Whether they come to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) or the Adiala jail, action under Section 144 would be carried out without any discrimination,” Chaudhry warned while speaking to the media in Islamabad. He particularly urged PTI-backed parliamentarians to “abide by the law”.
Chaudhry said Section 144 had been imposed in the twin cities “in light of intelligence reports”.
He further linked the matter to terrorism, saying: “Terrorists look for instances [which they can use] to spread fear and make headlines; be it [a] political gathering, courts or important places or offices.”
The state minister further said that terrorists used social media applications, particularly for communication. “They use these apps with virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their identities and locations.”
So, Chaudhry continued, the interior ministry had decided that it, along with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), would find a solution to this problem.
“The PTA has issued a detailed press release regarding the registration of VPNs,” he said, adding that the government did not want IT-related businesses to be affected by this measure. “But, it has to be done at any cost to ensure that mobile and social media apps are not used for terrorist activities.”
The state minister also recalled that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had ruled that state resources were not to be used for political activities.
So, “we hope that the KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) chief minister, who repeatedly comes to Islamabad and Pindi, will not use state resources for his political activities”, he added.
The state minister asserted that “KP police will [only] be used in KP for security”.
“If they come to Islamabad or any other province, prior intimation will be required in a proper manner. If any state resources are used without any intimation, action will be taken and criminal cases will be registered against government employees [concerned], in line with the PHC’s directive,” he warned.
He further stated that Section 144 had been imposed for the protection of lives. “An incident has occurred in Islamabad, and threats still exist,” he said.
The minister pointed out that the PTI had staged protests in Rawalpindi, demanding meetings with Imran, several times.
The administration, he said, was closely monitoring the situation to ensure that citizens’ lives and peace in the city were not affected. “To ensure that such gatherings of protests do not cause any loss.”
Here, he also recalled the violent protests of May 9, 2023, which were held after Imran’s arrest. “They will do it themselves just like on May 9, and entire Pakistan will face the consequences. They will do it themselves, and will then deny [any responsibility].”
He maintained that KP Chief Minister had no authority to demand a meeting with Imran.
Reiterating that Section 144 had been imposed in light of terror incidents. “And I hope that terrorists will not be facilitated — that such gatherings are held where they could carry out [terror] activities with ease and spread fear in Pakistan. We have made foolproof security arrangements, and God willing, no such incident will take place. But, we need the cooperation of other political parties and civil society to ensure this.”
He again warned Section 144 would be “strictly imposed” and action would be taken in light of the PHC order if any provincial public office holder used state resources for political activities.
To a question about whether Imran would be shifted from the Adiala jail to a prison in Islamabad, Chaudhry said: “It is too early to say anything.”
The minister said that the prison’s construction was in its last stages, after which its staff would have to be trained. “That jail is not being constructed for just one prison. It was needed in Islamabad as prisoners from the federal capital had to be sent to jails elsewhere,” he added.
He also said if the authorities were provided all the necessary documents and “tracking number, Imran’s sons would be issued visas in the next 24 hours”.
Security beefed up in Pindi
Rawalpindi police said effective arrangements had been made to ensure law and order in the city. In a statement, police said at least 3,000 security officers were performing traffic and other security duties.
“Section 144 has been imposed across Rawalpindi for three days which restricts unlawful assembly, rally and protest,” it said.
It added that Rawalpindi police would deal strictly with those who breached the law and it would ensure the implementation of Section 144 to maintain law and order in the city.
Reports from the twin cities said pickets were set up on routes leading to the Adiala jail. Meanwhile, roads leading to the Red Zone, which houses key government buildings, from Serena Hotel and the National Database and Registration Authority office were also reported to have been blocked.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said on Monday the opposition lawmakers from both houses of parliament will protest outside the IHC before taking their demonstration to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and other leaders will stage protests in the twin cities, Qaiser said.
Last week, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time.
Imran’s sisters had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI also alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters after they, along with other party members and supporters, held a protest outside the jail on November 19.
There were also speculations about his health, but the government and the PTI leaders had said that he was in good health.</p><small>2025-12-02 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/022044575054c30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958801/pakistan-crypto-council-ceo-bilal-bin-saqib-steps-down-as-pms-aide-on-virtual-assets' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal bin Saqib steps down as PM’s aide on virtual assets</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency, it emerged on Tuesday.
He continues to serve as the chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
A notification from the Cabinet Division, signed October 13, said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accepted Saqib’s resignation from the position with effect from August 21.
He was appointed to the role on May 26, with the status of a minister of state.
Saqib was appointed the PVARA chairman with the status of a minister of state on a pro bono basis for three years on August 1.
PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.­
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.

The traffic police’s crackdown on traffic violations across the province left motorists in turmoil when they lodged over 4,600 cases and arrested around 3,100 citizens, including a large number of schoolchildren, during the last 72 hours, creating a criminal record for a majority of them.
Parents lambasted the Punjab government for making criminal profiles of these children, saying it would have long-term consequences on their careers and declaring it an overreaction by the traffic police.
According to a statement from the office, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed her displeasure over minors being handcuffed for violating traffic rules.
“A decision has been made in principle to issue smart cards and motorcycle licences to 16-year-olds,” the statement read. “Traffic police across the province will also host an awareness week for the public, especially for students.”
The statement added that a warning would be issued for motorcyclists not wearing helmets for their first offence, while drones and police body cameras would be employed for the first time by the traffic police officials.
“Parents should be playing a greater role in abiding by traffic rules, more so than children and students,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying. “Traffic rules have been created to protect people. The public needs to change their habits for their own safety.”
She added that she did not want to arrest children, but emphasised that they needed to obey the law.
“It’s not the children’s fault, we did not teach them to wear helmets,” the CM was quoted as saying. “Parents need to teach their children about the importance of helmets for road safety.”
Last week, the Punjab government introduced 20 major reforms in the 60-year-old Traffic Act, aiming to bring about better traffic management in the province, including a decisive crackdown to end underage driving, which may be punishable by six months’ imprisonment.</p><small>2025-12-02 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637052-pakistan-sends-aid-to-sri-lanka-via-sea-after-india-denies-airspace-access' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sends aid to Sri Lanka via sea after India denies airspace access</strong></a><br><p>

Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Ali Nasir Rizvi, speaking to the media, said the explosion occurred around 4pm and was caused by a gas leak ignited by a short circuit.
“When summer ends, the university turns off its gas connection. They turned it on at 3:30pm, but there was an accumulation of gas and a short circuit somewhere,“ the IG said. “A gas leakage caused the explosion.”
The IG outlined that the explosion occurred in a prayer room, which was near a clerk’s office. He stated that seven people were caught in the explosion.
“Five students were there with a clerk and a junior assistant,” IG Rizvi explained.
“The clerk sustained 60-65 per cent burn injuries, the clerical assistant was burned and the students suffered minor burn injuries. Seven people are under treatment; of those, six are out of danger as per the hospital.”

IG Rizvi added that multiple teams were present at the scene, including Operations, Investigations, Special Branch and the Counter-Terrorism Department.
“We have examined the scene thoroughly and have ruled out the use of explosives,” the IG said. “No traces have been found. We are telling the media that this explosion was caused by a gas leakage and a short circuit.”
He added that standard operating procedures were invoked to close all gas connections, and Numl’s administration was instructed to check the gas lines as a precaution.
“We have also instructed them to check the structural stability of the building where the explosion took place,” IG Rizvi added.
Rescue 1122 control-in-charge Subhan told Dawn earlier that the emergency service first received a call at 4:06pm.
“The caller did not know the nature of the explosion, but the administration called us and said that it was caused by a gas cylinder or a gas leak in a room,” he said over the phone.
He added that the fire was controlled by emergency services.
The official added that damage from the explosion was contained to a single room and the rest of the building was not affected.
Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi, speaking to Dawn soon after the incident, had also said that a gas leakage caused the explosion.
Visuals from the varsity showed panicked students evacuating the campus as emergency and rescue personnel tried to extinguish the blaze in one of the rooms on the premises.
Bystanders could also be seen rushing to the help of an injured person lying on the ground.
In 2002, the National Institute of Modern Languages was upgraded to a university. It offers many courses from the undergraduate to the PhD level.</p><small>2025-12-02 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637020-16-year-olds-can-now-secure-motorcycle-licences-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>16-year-olds can now secure motorcycle licences in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Judicial magistrate Shaista Khan Kundi issued the remand order on the police’s request.
According to a First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station, the accident occurred late on Monday night near the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad, when a black SUV allegedly driven by the judge’s son struck two girls who worked at the PNCA.
The victims were riding a scooter when they were hit by the SUV and reportedly died on the spot. Police reported that the vehicle fled the area immediately after the collision.
The FIR, lodged on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, states that police traced the vehicle through its registration number and later reached a private hospital where the suspect had reportedly been taken for medical treatment.
He was subsequently taken into custody, and medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 322 (manslaughter) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code have been invoked in the case.
The investigating officer informed the court that further custody was required to complete the investigation, including verification of the suspect’s medical report, vehicle inspection and eyewitness statements.
After reviewing the case record and police request, the court approved physical remand of the suspect for further investigation. The bodies of the deceased were shifted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences for an autopsy.
Police said efforts were underway to obtain CCTV footage and determine whether speeding or negligence was involved, while authorities assured the families of the victims that the case would be investigated strictly on merit.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-02 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636990-imran-khans-sister-granted-permission-to-meet-pti-founder-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sister declares him 'completely healthy' after jail meeting</strong></a><br><p>
