Speaking at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York yesterday, the PM told interviewer Ayman Mohyeldin that the attack on the Israeli soldiers was “basically a violation by the Palestinian party”, pointing out that while Hamas has put out a statement that they are not in communication with this group, there is no “verification if this is true or not”.
It is important to note, however, that following the attack on the soldier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful” retaliatory strikes on Gaza.
The attacks killed 104 people, mostly women and children, Al Jazeera reported, citing Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel claimed its strikes targeted senior Hamas fighters, killing dozens, and then said it would start observing the ceasefire again mid-Wednesday.
“We’ve been engaging in a very intensive way with both parties in order to ensure that the ceasefire holds,” Qatar’s PM stated. “The US engagement, of course, was key in that. And I believe that what happened yesterday [Tuesday] was a violation.”
He pointed out that there had been discussions about Hamas trying to “delay the transfer of bodies”. “We made it very clear for them that this is part of the commitment that we needed to be fulfilled,” he added.
“From our perspective, since the start of this, since October 7 until today, if you look throughout the process, we went through a lot of challenges, a lot of obstacles, and it wasn’t an easy road,” he said.
“We tried our best to navigate and to make sure that we achieved the first [ceasefire], the second one, and now the ceasefire that hopefully will last,” the PM added.
Referring to the incident as “very disappointing and frustrating”, Al-Thani said they are trying to contain it. “We mobilised right away after this and in full coordination with the United States. And we have seen that the US is also committed to the deal.”</p><small>2025-10-30 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301646068220b26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952167/india-remains-committed-to-afghanistans-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-and-independence-foreign-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>India remains committed to Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence: foreign ministry</strong></a><br><p>Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday said that India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan, amid Kabul’s heightened tensions with Pakistan.
Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks amid border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has long been warning Kabul against allowing the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil — a claim the Taliban deny. Following a ceasefire, talks in Turkiye began to establish a mechanism to monitor Taliban efforts to curb cross-border attacks, but have so far resulted in an impasse.
At a press briefing, the spokesperson received questions asking why Pakistan was blaming Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij for terrorist attacks on its soil and  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks about Kabul fighting a proxy war on behalf of Delhi.
“In my last briefing, I had elaborated our point of view; our thoughts on this particular matter. Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its territories,” Jaiswal replied. “Pakistan seems to think it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable.
“India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaiswal said.
 


In response to a question about Indian projects in Afghanistan, Jaiswal referred to Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India and the joint statement issued afterwards.
“As part of the visit, we had issued a joint statement between both countries,” the spokesperson said. “This joint statement clearly emphasises that India stands ready to support all efforts of Afghanistan that are directed towards the sustainable management of water resources, including hydroelectric projects.”
Border skirmishes and failed talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30165236a25ecbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952145/pti-backed-khurram-zeeshan-wins-senate-seat-vacated-after-shibli-farazs-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification</strong></a><br><p>PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots.
A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat.
Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes.
“Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account.
“Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran.
Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan.
Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, four Awami National Party (ANP) lawmakers did not take part in the polling process.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan.
 






The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO).

Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year.
Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion.
 
 

Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature.
Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls.
Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court.
CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today
Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded.
This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier.
 
 

Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”.
Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today.
He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”.
 
 

The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors.
CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.”
“This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations.
The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.

Malik, terming it a “progressive step“ to an “equitable and gender-sensitive” interpretation of family law, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
On October 25, in a 17-page ruling, Justice Malik set aside a Peshawar High Court (PHC) ruling over a divorce case, terming psychological abuse as cruelty, based on which a marriage can legally be dissolved, along with highlighting the “deeply patriarchal” approach of the court in such cases.
NCSW chairperson, Ume Laila Azhar, in a statement, called the verdict “a progressive step towards a more equitable and gender-sensitive interpretation of family law.“
According to APP, she noted that the “court’s acknowledgement of emotional and psychological cruelty as equally serious as physical abuse marks a significant milestone in safeguarding women’s dignity and well-being within marital relationships.”
“This ruling upholds the constitutional and Islamic principles of justice, equality, and human dignity by reaffirming that Khula is an independent and inalienable right of a woman — not contingent upon the husband’s consent,” Azhar was quoted as saying.
“It strengthens the jurisprudence of women’s right to self-determination and ensures that their mental and emotional health receives due consideration in family courts,“ she added.
The commission, in its statement, also commended the “SC emphasis on adopting gender-sensitive language and eliminating patriarchal reasoning from judicial discourse,” as per the report.
The Judgement
The judgment — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com —  pertains to a case involving a woman seeking the dissolution of her marriage on the following grounds: “cruelty, non-payment of maintenance during the subsistence of marriage, and on (her spouse) taking an additional wife.”
Justice Malik’s judgment came in response to a 2024 PHC ruling, which had dismissed the petitioner’s application for dissolution of her marriage and granted her a Khula instead, without her consent.
In the judgment, Justice Malik noted, citing the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (DMMA), that dissolution of a marriage means that the “marriage can be brought to an end at the instance of the woman if she is able to successfully establish one or more of the statutory grounds provided within the DMMA.”
These include: husband’s disappearance, failure to provide maintenance, imprisonment, impotence, insanity, cruelty and the taking of an additional wife.
On the matter of cruelty, Justice Malik ruled that, as per the DMMA, “cruelty can range from physical assault, to mental or emotional abuse, to interference with property or religion, to inequitable treatment in the context of a second marriage.”
She went on to say: “As per our jurisprudence, courts have defined cruelty as being behaviour which is not limited to physical abuse but involves behaviour which can result in mental and emotional abuse.”
In a marriage, cruelty can also be any act that makes “it impossible for the wife to live with dignity and security within the marital home and relationship,” she said.
Referring to the case, Justice Malik highlighted that the family court “failed to
examine the mental and emotional abuse and the impact of the cruelty on the petitioner,” and rather “fell into error by insisting upon documentary or
medical proof.”
Further, on the matter of the petitioner enduring physical abuse at the hands of her husband, Justice Malik noted that, “The Family Court also proceeded on an incorrect premise by discarding the statements of the witnesses of the petitioner on the ground that she was never beaten in front of them.”
She continued: “It is important to note that abuse within the marital home is often a bedroom crime, which is committed in private and for which there are no witnesses.
This crime remains largely unreported due to socio-cultural barriers, economic dependency and the lack of information on the issue.“
“As a consequence, victims remain silent and endure for the sake of the family or the children,” she added.
Regarding the family court’s decision to grant the petitioner Khula without her consent, Justice Ayesha remarked that the reasoning “such reasoning conflates two separate legal remedies” and “undermines the purpose of the DMMA.”
On that note, she also highlighted that “the law demands that women’s choices, words, and rights be respected as a matter of principle, not presumption.”
Justice Malik called for “a gender lens” in deciding such matters, stating that “it helps the court understand the social realities in which women
experience cruelty.”
“Seeing the case through a gender lens also means understanding the different ways women experience harm,” she added.
Addressing the language used for the petitioner in the court’s ruling, such as  “disobedient wife” and “self-deserted lady”, she said, “using language loosely or without thought stigmatises women, trivialises abuse, and reinforces the same patriarchal thinking that the law seeks to overcome.”
“When judgments rely on stereotypes or excuse unlawful conduct, they perpetuate inequality and shape social attitudes in ways that deny women dignity, fairness, and justice,” she stressed, adding that the language used “represented a deeply patriarchal mindset.”
She continued: “It shifts the discussion from cruelty towards the woman and the exercise of her autonomy to her obedience and disobedience.
“These are social judgments disguised as findings of law,” she said, adding that “it is therefore necessary to address and correct such language as a matter of substantive justice.”</p><small>2025-10-30 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300720535f583ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952131/trump-tells-pentagon-to-immediately-resume-testing-us-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>Trump tells Pentagon to immediately resume testing US nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump ordered the US military on Thursday to immediately resume testing nuclear weapons after a gap of 33 years, minutes before beginning a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump made the surprise announcement on Truth Social while he was aboard his Marine One helicopter flying to meet Xi for a trade negotiating session in Busan, South Korea. He said he was instructing the Pentagon to test the US nuclear arsenal on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers.
“Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump wrote in a social media post.
“Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”
 






The move comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Moscow had successfully tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone, in defiance of Washington’s warnings.
A senior Russian lawmaker said Trump’s decision would herald a new era of unpredictability and open confrontation, state news agency RIA reported.
China’s foreign ministry called for the US to abide by its commitment to a moratorium on nuclear testing and uphold the global strategic balance and stability.
 
 

It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to nuclear-explosive testing, which would be carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration, or flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles.
No nuclear power, other than North Korea, has carried out explosive testing in more than 25 years.
Nuclear testing sites to be determined later
Later, on his way back to Washington, Trump said testing was needed to ensure the US keeps up with its rival nuclear powers.
“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said on board Air Force One, adding that nuclear test sites would be determined later.
Asked whether the world was entering a more risky phase around nuclear weapons, Trump dismissed the threat, saying US stocks were “well locked up” before adding he would welcome denuclearisation.
 


“I’d like to see a denuclearisation because we have so many and Russia’s second and China’s third and China will catch up within four or five years,” he said.
“We are actually talking to Russia about that and China would be added to that if we do something.”
China more than doubled nuclear arsenal in last 5 years
Trump’s decision to restart nuclear weapons testing follows a rapid expansion by China of its nuclear stockpile in recent years.
It also comes just after Russia announced a “successful“ test of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile as well as a nuclear-powered torpedo, which military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
Trump addressed the Russian moves on his way to Asia earlier this week, telling reporters that Putin should be working to end the war in Ukraine “instead of testing missiles“.
Beijing has more than doubled the size of its arsenal to an estimated 600 nuclear weapons in 2025 from 300 weapons in 2020, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank.
 
 

It said US military officials estimate that China will have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030. A Victory Day parade in September revealed five nuclear capabilities that can all reach the continental United States, CSIS said.
The Washington-based Arms Control Association (ACA) says the US has a stockpile of 5,225 nuclear warheads and Russia has 5,580.
As Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
Negative reactions
The reaction to Trump’s announcement on testing was swift.
Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said on X: “I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.”
 






ACA Director Daryl Kimball said it would take the US at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada.
“Trump is misinformed and out of touch. The US has no technical, military, or political reason to resume nuclear explosive testing for the first time since 1992,” Kimball said on X.
Trump’s announcement could “trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty“.
Apart from providing technical data, a US test would be seen in Russia and China as a deliberate assertion of Washington’s strategic power.
 






Putin has repeatedly said that Russia will test if the US does.
In August, Trump said he had discussed nuclear arms control with Putin and wanted China to get involved.
 
 

Beijing responded by saying it was “unreasonable and unrealistic” to ask the country to join in nuclear disarmament negotiations with the two countries, since its arsenal was much smaller.
Trump had first laid out his intention to pursue nuclear arms control efforts in February, saying he wanted to begin discussions with both Putin and Xi about imposing limits on their arsenals.
Most major nuclear powers, except North Korea, stopped explosive nuclear testing in the 1990s. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in 2017. Russia’s last confirmed test was in 1990, followed by the last US test in 1992, and by China’s in 1996.
The US opened the nuclear era in July 1945 with the test of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and then dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to force Japan to surrender in World War Two.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3015191431a2aa3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952163/ioc-removes-saudi-arabia-as-host-of-inaugural-esports-olympics' target='_blank'><strong>IOC removes Saudi Arabia as host of inaugural Esports Olympics</strong></a><br><p>The inaugural Esports Olympics scheduled to be held in 2027 will no longer be hosted by Saudi Arabia, the International Olympic Committee announced on Thursday.
The IOC and the Saudi National Olympic Committee “mutually agreed that they will end their cooperation on the Olympic Esports Games”, a statement said.
The first Esports Games was originally slated to be held this year in Riyadh but
were postponed in February.
 






The Saudis were guaranteed the hosting of the Games for 12 years from 2025, when the agreement was first announced by the IOC in July last year.
Then-IOC president Thomas Bach had been influential in the creation of the event but has since been replaced at the helm by Kirsty Coventry.
Olympic Esports Series competitions, smaller virtual sports events run by the IOC, were held in 2021 and 2023. They were widely panned by gaming critics over the lack of traditional esports titles.
“Recently, the two parties and the Esports World Cup Foundation sat down again and reviewed this initiative,” the IOC statement added.
“They mutually agreed that they will end their cooperation on the Olympic Esports Games. At the same time, both parties are committed to pursuing their own esports ambitions on separate paths.”
The first two editions of the Esports World Cup, which includes many of the world’s most popular games, was held in 2024 and earlier this year in Riyadh.
It is organised by Saudi Arabia.
“This approach will be a chance to better fit the Olympic Esports Games to the long-term ambitions of the Olympic movement and to spread the opportunities presented by the Olympic Esports Games more widely, with the objective of having the inaugural Games as soon as possible,” the IOC said.
Saudi sports events are routinely accused of being used as a distraction from human rights violations, a practice dubbed “sportswashing”.
The kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years, though critics, including women’s rights groups and members of the LGBTQ community, allege it is using its Public Investment Fund (PIF) to sportswash its human rights record.
The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30145912f1c987e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952161/what-the-us-resumption-of-nuclear-testing-could-mean-for-the-rest-of-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>What the US resumption of nuclear testing could mean for the rest of the world</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he had instructed the Department of Defence to immediately resume the testing of nuclear weapons on an “equal basis” with other nuclear powers, in a move that could potentially destabilise the nuclear treaty under which countries have been constrained for decades.
The move has raised concerns about the threat of nuclear power being wielded by multiple countries, including the risk of the collapse of the nuclear disarmament treaty that keeps this power under strict control.
Why is the US resuming nuclear testing?
Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social early this morning the news of the announcement, saying that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country as a result of his first term in office.
“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but I had no choice!” he said, adding, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”
 






The Associated Press (AP) reports, contrastingly, that Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the US has 5,225. The two countries account for nearly 90 per cent of the world’s atomic warheads.
In his post, the president attributed the decision to other countries’ testing programmes, saying he had ordered the resumption of testing “on an equal basis” to these countries.
He was possibly alluding to the successful test of the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo by Russia as announced by its president Vladimir Putin yesterday.
There are a few confirmed details about the Poseidon, but Reuters has called it a “nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone”. Military analysts have said this torpedo is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells, while arms control experts say it breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules.
The US also has a nuclear weapons rivalry with China, which AP reports is building more ground-based nuclear missile siloes. In particular, under President Xi Jinping, NYT says that China has been rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal after decades of maintaining a comparatively modest force.
After the earlier remarks, Trump had met Xi today on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and struck a deal to reduce his harsh tariffs on China, in exchange for Beijing resuming US soybean purchases; analysts now express concern about the consequences of ratcheting up nuclear competition between the countries.
According to NYT, “Trump’s combative words alone could reinforce wariness in Beijing about US nuclear intentions. Nuclear weapons are one area where distrust between China and the United States has deepened, with little prospect for quick agreement.”
However, NYT added that when asked later about his remarks on nuclear weapons testing, Trump suggested that they were not related to China. “It had to do with others,” he said, without naming any countries. “They seem to all be nuclear testing.”
Nuclear treaty under stress
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been signed by 187 states and is one of the most widely supported disarmament treaties in the world, according to The Conversation. Although the US has yet to ratify the treaty, it is legally bound not to violate its spirit and purpose as a signatory for decades.
According to Business Insider, the US last conducted a nuclear weapons test in 1992, when Congress pushed to halt such experiments after the Cold War’s conclusion. Former US President George H.W. Bush signed the moratorium on tests in October of the same year.
Under the treaty, both the US and Russia have agreed to keep their deployed warheads to a maximum of 1,550. However, China’s rapid buildup of weapons has led to the fear from Washington that China will soon reach the same number of nuclear weapons, turning two-way negotiations into a three-cornered struggle.
The New York Times reports that moves toward renewed explosive tests of nuclear warheads could “further endanger the treaty that for decades has constrained all but a handful of countries from carrying them out”.
A new arms race
AP reports that, if the US restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be.
Nonproliferation experts have warned that any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by backlash. They also point out the possibility that the decision will serve as a “starting gun” for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing.
If the United States follows through with resuming nuclear testing, “it would effectively give, I think, China and Russia a carte blanche to resume full-yield nuclear testing, which is something that neither country has done in a number of years,” said Ankit Panda, author of The New Nuclear Age and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, according to NYT.
Panda added that the nuclear nonproliferation regime was “under tremendous stress”, saying, “Russia, China, the United States can’t even agree on the basic principles of what really makes the nonproliferation regime tick.”
Meanwhile, Business Insider reports that some advisors have urged the US to pursue more aggressive nuclear policies and introduce additional modern methods of nuclear attack as a show of strength. As a result, concerns have been growing among nuclear analysts in Washington that the world is on the cusp of a new arms race.

Discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had begun in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern of terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan had been a bone of contention, resulting in a stalemate.
“While the talks have not begun [again], our delegation is still in Istanbul,” Asif said in an exclusive interview with Geo News.
He added that “discussions could still restart” if there was “some development that indicates a material change in Kabul’s attitude on the insistence of these two friendly countries (Turkiye and Qatar)”.
“Our stance, that there will not be any attacks on us (Pakistan) from their land and they will not back such attacks, is a sticking point. If an understanding can be reached on that, [well and good], it will be a good thing,” Asif said.
 


The minister noted, “There has been no breakthrough so far. There has been no development that you can have high hopes from.”
However, he added that the defence ministers and intelligence chiefs of the mediating countries were making efforts to end the stalemate in talks.
Asif said the Pakistani delegation had even reached the airport in Istanbul to depart, but a request was made by Turkiye and Qatar to “give us one more chance”. He said Turkish officials offered to speak to Kabul’s delegation and “pave a way out”.
The minister noted that bilateral trade and investment should take place, but added that it was in the “hands of Kabul if it wanted to play a constructive role in this”.
“But if they are stubborn or are insisting on becoming a proxy of India and backing the destruction of Pakistan’s peace, then so be it,” Asif added.
 
 

The defence minister’s comments come after security sources earlier today said Pakistan had agreed to resume talks with the Afghan Taliban at the request of mediators.
A security official said the Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was about to return, but would extend its stay there.
However, the source stressed that the discussions will be held on Pakistan’s “main demand” that Afghanistan takes “clear, verifiable and effective action” against terrorists.
It was decided to “give another chance to peace” by continuing the talks, the security official said. They added that Pakistan again underscored that Afghan soil will not be used to carry out terrorist attacks against Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides over the past few weeks engaging in border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
A first round of Pak-Afghan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19 had extended an initial 48-hour truce between the neighbouring countries. The Doha talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
The second round of dialogue in Istanbul failed to “bring about any workable solution”, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said late on Wednesday after four days of deliberations. The statement was followed by strongly worded remarks by Asif, who warned Kabul of strikes deep in Afghanistan if terrorist activities continued to target Pakistan.
Obstacles in reaching agreement
According to Asif, the Afghan Taliban acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
However, the other side “was not ready” to give the assurance in writing, despite agreeing with them, the minister told reporters at Parliament House yesterday.
Asif stated that Pakistan was not offered to include the TTP in the talks, and even if it had been, the proposal would not have been accepted. He said the Afghan delegation was in continuous contact with Kabul, which was colluding with India and preventing an agreement.
In a separate interview with Al Arabiya, the minister said he had evidence to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
 
 

Asif asserted that “India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score“ after the May conflict with Pakistan, where it was “defeated”.
The talks in Turkiye had began with the aim of finalising a mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
The agenda included dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad had planned to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing. Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
Additional priorities included securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30144743f67a5bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952154/israel-demanded-google-amazon-use-secret-code-to-bypass-legal-obligations-investigation-reveals' target='_blank'><strong>Israel demanded Google, Amazon use secret code to bypass legal obligations, investigation reveals</strong></a><br><p>Tech giants Google and Amazon agreed to use a secret code to evade legal obligations in countries around the world to serve Israeli interests, a report by The Guardian has revealed.
The joint investigation, conducted with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, highlights how a $1.2 billion cloud-computing deal in 2021 (known as Project Nimbus)  between Israeli government and the tech firms had an “unusual demand”, i.e., agree to use a secret code as part of an arrangement that would become known as the “winking mechanism”.
Project Nimbus was a joint contract that aimed to provide cloud computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology services to the Israeli government and its military, which has faced condemnation for its war on Gaza, described by United Nations experts and several countries as a “genocide”.
Google employees based in the United States also staged protests last year at the tech giant’s offices in New York City, California and Seattle to oppose the contract.
The unusual demand as part of the Project Nimbus, according to the Guardian, was born out of Israel’s concerns that data it moves into the global corporations’ cloud platforms could end up in the hands of foreign law enforcement authorities.
“Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses routinely comply with requests from police, prosecutors and security services to hand over customer data to assist investigations,” the report points out. However, “the process is often cloaked in secrecy”.
“The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent,” the report states.
But for Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. “So to deal with the threat, officials created a secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.”
According to the report, “Israeli officials inserted into the Nimbus deal a requirement for the companies to send coded message, a “wink”, to its government, revealing the identity of the country they had been compelled to hand over Israeli data to, but were gagged from saying so”.
The report refers to leaked documents from Israel’s finance ministry, which include a finalised version of the Nimbus agreement suggesting the secret code would take the form of payments (referred to as special compensation) made by the companies to the Israeli government.
Citing the documents, the Guardian details that the payments must be made within 24 hours of the information being transferred and correspond to the telephone dialling code of the foreign country, amounting to sums between 1,000 and 9,999 shekels.
The report highlights the mechanism of the deal as follows:


If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialling code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.


If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialling code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.


If the companies conclude that the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signalling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.


Moreover, “Israeli officials also feared a scenario in which its access to the cloud providers’ technology could be blocked or restricted,” the report says.
“In particular, officials worried that activists and rights groups could place pressure on Google and Amazon, or seek court orders in several European countries, to force them to terminate or limit their business with Israel if their technology were linked to human rights violations.”
The Guardian investigation refers to government documents prepared after the deal was signed, where Israel inserted controls into the Nimbus agreement which Google and Amazon “appear to have accepted”.
“The documents state that the agreement prohibits the companies from revoking or restricting Israel’s access to their cloud platforms, either due to changes in company policy or because they find Israel’s use of their technology violates their terms of service,” the report emphasises.
The Guardian further cites an Israeli official familiar with the project stating that there can be “no restrictions” on the kind of information moved into Google and Amazon’s cloud platforms, including military and intelligence data.
“The terms of the deal seen by the Guardian state that Israel is entitled to migrate to the cloud or generate in the cloud any content data they wish,” as per the report.
“Israel inserted the provisions into the deal to avoid a situation in which the companies decide that a certain customer is causing them damage, and therefore cease to sell them services,” the Guardian cites one document as noting.
Last month, Microsoft disabled a set of cloud and AI services used by a unit within the Israeli Ministry of Defence after an internal review found preliminary evidence supporting media reports of a surveillance system in Gaza and the West Bank.
However, under the terms of the Nimbus deal, “Google and Amazon are prohibited from taking such action as it would discriminate against the Israeli government,” the Guardian points out. “Doing so would incur financial penalties for the companies, as well as legal action for breach of contract.”
The report quotes the Israeli finance ministry spokesperson who said Google and Amazon are “bound by stringent contractual obligations that safeguard Israel’s vital interests”, adding that these agreements are confidential and “we will not legitimise the article’s claims by disclosing private commercial terms”.</p><small>2025-10-30 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301237486cc4d4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952156/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-indicted-in-case-pertaining-to-controversial-social-media-posts' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha indicted in case pertaining to controversial social media posts</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Thursday indicted human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case related to controversial social media posts.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
 
 

Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the case, in which Mazari and Chattha both denied guilt.
The court summoned all prosecution witnesses for the next hearing and ordered Chattha to once again submit bail bonds, to which Mazari responded, “If you want to arrest us, reject my bail as well.”
The judge replied, “My principle is that if I respect you, I will get respect.”
Mazari’s advocate, Qaiser Imam, pointed out that the accused also had to appear in other cases, “sometimes at the Islamabad High Court (IHC), sometimes in Rawalpindi”.
However, in response, Judge Majoka said that he had “adjourned the hearing three times on their request for that reason”.
The court then adjourned the hearing till November 5.
Yesterday, Chattha had been arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom” on social media platform X.
 






He has now been released.
Speaking to reporters outside the court today, Chattha claimed that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”, saying, “This was not according to any law.”
He added that Majoka had recalled his “illegal order” even before they could argue against it today, but had insisted that they submit another Rs10,000 bail bond as the previous one had been forfeited. He also recalled this order after Chattha refused to comply with it, the advocate said.
“The principle is this … you are running a court, you are a judge; how are you so far removed from the four corners of law?” he said while speaking to the media. “Why do you feel that doing this (specifically targeting the two accused) will get you praise?”
Chattha also said that the era of the courts intimidating people with the threat of jail time or punishments was over, saying, “Nowadays, word spreads very quickly. People are present — witnesses are present and they see this.”
 






Asked what proceedings had been delayed yesterday and whether they had taken place today, the advocate said that only four days after the supply of copy, the court wanted to frame the charge. According to him, the judge had told the accused beforehand that if there were cases against them, they could come in at the end of the day as he was there until 3:30pm.
“Imaan went first in the morning, then at 11am, then sat there waiting for him from 2-2:30pm,” he said. “He did not leave his chamber.”
Chattha added, “The moment I got back from cases in Pindi, I was present in court before 2:35pm. And he got angry that I had appeared at the end of the day, so he couldn’t indict me … So he forfeited the bail bonds and issued the warrant to my face and had me arrested from the courtroom.”</p><small>2025-10-30 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300923053ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952142/ttp-commander-among-4-terrorists-killed-as-security-forces-thwart-infiltration-attempt-at-pak-afghan-border-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>TTP commander among 4 terrorists killed as security forces thwart infiltration attempt at Pak-Afghan border: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday that a “high-value target” identified as a commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was among four terrorists killed after security forces thwarted an attempt to infiltrate the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.
“Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij, including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement further said that the militant leader was the deputy of TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and the head of Rehbari Shura of Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”.
“It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij, while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said.
“It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
“It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded security forces for foiling the infiltration by India-backed Fitna al-Khwarij in Bajaur. In a post on social media platform X, he praised the troops’ courage and reaffirmed that the nation stands united under Azm-i-Istehkam to eliminate all terrorist elements.
 






18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan
Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists.
 






“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country.
President Zardari, in a statement posted on X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to security forces for thwarting the infiltration attempt.
“The nation takes pride in the skill and bravery of the security forces,” Naqvi said, vowing to “stand side by side” with them.
 






Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.</p><small>2025-10-30 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631259-from-bad-to-worse-60-increase-in-violations-against-media-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>From bad to worse: 60% increase in violations against media in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

The plea, filed by Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi in June, urges the SC to set aside an April 15 order of the Balo­ch­istan High Court (BHC) that rej­ected a petition against Mahrang’s detention under the Main­tenance of Public Order— a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order initially for a period of 30 days. Mahrang is currently detained at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta on charges of attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting people to violence.
The plea filed by her sister was taken up by the CB today. The CB was headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprised Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi Shakeel Ahmad.
During the hearing, Nadia’s counsel Siddiqui argued that “this case should be fixed before a regular bench and not a constitutional bench”.
At this, Justice Mazhar said, “Since you have challenged the MPO, that makes this a case for the CB.”
Siddiqi responded by saying that he did not ask for “an interpretation of the law” and had only challenged the MPO order.
Subsequently, the court referred the case to the Practice and Procedure Committee.
Appeal
Mahrang, whose advocacy group has been working against enforced disappearances since 2018, has been in detention since March 22.
Nadia had initially filed a petition in the BHC against her sister’s detention. However, in its April 15 order, the BHC disposed of the application and directed the petitioner to approach the Balochistan Home Department.
Subsequently, Nadia had approached the apex court. The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state were named as res­pon­dents in her petition filed in the SC.
The plea contended that the April 15 BHC order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The petition alleged that Mahrang’s repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
 
 

It stated that Mahrang’s father and brother, too, were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
The appeal further said that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detainee and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It recalled that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The petition further contended that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner, by issuing the MPO order, acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.
BYC leaders’ detention
Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the MPO in March and have remained in custody since, having been remanded multiple times.
They were initially taken into custody for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, their detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order for their detention.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-10-30 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301247574742954.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952155/indian-state-backed-refinery-halts-russian-oil' target='_blank'><strong>Indian state-backed refinery halts Russian oil</strong></a><br><p>Indian state-backed refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy has halted purchases of Russian crude after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two largest oil companies, the firm said.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
Trump has claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to cut his Russian oil imports as part of a prospective US trade deal — something New Delhi has not confirmed.
HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL), a joint venture between steel tycoon Lakshmi Niwas Mittal and state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), said it had “taken the decision to suspend further purchases of Russian crude”.
The statement, issued on Wednesday, said last week the decision came after “recent announcements of new restrictions on imports of crude oil from Russia” by the United States, European Union (EU) and United Kingdom.
“HMEL’s business activity is in-line with [the] Indian government and energy security policy”, the statement added.
Reliance Industries, the privately-owned main Indian buyer of Russian crude, said last week it was assessing the implications of Washington’s restrictions, as well as those imposed this week by the EU.
“We will comply with the EU’s guidelines on the import of refined products into Europe,” a spokesperson for the company said, and with any guidelines from the Indian side.
The EU’s new curbs include a complete ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026.
Reliance said it was confident that its “time-tested, diversified crude sourcing strategy” would ensure stability in refinery operations for meeting the domestic and export requirements, including to Europe.
On Wednesday, an investigation by London’s Financial Times reported that HMEL had received several shipments of Russian crude transported via vessels later blacklisted under US and EU sanctions.
HMEL said it did not charter the vessels and had limited visibility over the transport chain. It said that the ship that delivered the crude to India “was not under” US sanctions at the time of delivery.
India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
Traditionally reliant on Middle Eastern producers, New Delhi started buying heavily discounted Russian crude in 2022, taking advantage of Western sanctions that limited Moscow’s export options.</p><small>2025-10-30 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012424531709f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952152/teenage-australian-cricketer-dies-after-being-hit-by-ball-during-training' target='_blank'><strong>Teenage Australian cricketer dies after being hit by ball during training</strong></a><br><p>A promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer died on Thursday after being struck by a ball, with his family saying they were “utterly devastated”.
Ben Austin was in the nets with a helmet on before a Twenty20 game in Melbourne on Tuesday when he was hit in the neck while facing a ball-throwing device.
He was rushed to hospital in critical condition.
 






“We are utterly devastated by the passing of our beautiful Ben, who died earlier on Thursday morning,” his father Jace Austin said in a statement.
“This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers — going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.
“We would also like to support his teammate who was bowling in the nets.
This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well.”
Austin was an emerging bowler and batter, considered by his Ferntree Gully Cricket Club as a “star cricketer, great leader and an awesome young man”.
Deaths in cricket are rare.
 
 

The most recent high-profile one in Australia came in 2014 when Test star Phillip Hughes was killed when hit in the neck by a rising ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield game.
His death stunned Australia and the world cricket community, sparking an outpouring of grief and ushering in stronger protocols around concussion and better safety equipment.
Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins told broadcaster ABC there were similarities between the two tragedies.
“The ball hit him (Austin) in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,” Cummins said.

Pakistan put up a tough fight in all three sets but ultimately lost 25-21, 25-23, 25-23 to Iran.
The silver was Pakistan’s second medal at the ongoing games so far, with the boys Kabaddi team winning bronze last week.

The Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) said the team’s silver brought “immense pride and honour to the nation”.
“The team’s performance throughout the tournament was
exceptional — Pakistan did not lose a single match before the final, defeating teams like Mongolia, Bahrain, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and China with dominating performances,” the PVF said in a press release.
“The final match was a display of determination and courage, where the Pakistani players pushed hard in every set but were unfortunate to miss the gold medal by a close margin.
“Nevertheless, finishing undefeated until the final stands as a historic achievement for Pakistan volleyball at the youth level.”
Throughout the tournament, standout performances were delivered by Muhammad Yahya, Muhammad Anas, Muhammad Irfan, and Ajmal Junaid, PVF said.
The federation emphasised that the success was part of its “long-term development plan that started four years ago — from the U16 Asian Championship (Gold Medal) to the U18 Asian Championship, then the U19 World Championship, and now the Silver Medal at the 3rd Asian Youth Games 2025.”

Asif expressed these views during an interview with Al Arabiya English that was released late on Wednesday. His remarks are a continuation of the censure he has been directing toward Kabul in connection with terror incidents in Pakistan, recent border hostilities and the subsequent failure of talks with its Taliban rulers.
He was asked during his interview with Al Arabiya about the evidence he had to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
“When it comes to showing the evidence, or tabling the evidence, we will do that. We have the evidence,” Asif replied, highlighting that the Afghan foreign minister was visiting the Indian capital when border clashes began between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 


He went on to say that there was no doubt about Afghanistan having become an “Indian proxy”.
“And India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score [after] the last round we had around six or five months back, when they were squarely defeated. And they lost seven planes.
“The president of the United States has, on several occasions, mentioned — he even mentioned it yesterday — that seven beautiful planes were lost in the clash between India and Pakistan,” he added.
The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, and later raised the tally to seven.
US President Donald Trump has also mentioned the downing of seven jets during the conflict on multiple occasions, but has stopped short of elaborating on which side lost the jets.
When Asif again referred to the May episode in the context of hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the interviewer remarked that him saying India was trying to take revenge using another country was a very bold statement.
At that, Asif replied, “You want me to reiterate that statement? I will do that. I have no problem with that.” He continued that Kabul and New Delhi had a “relationship irrespective of the regimes in both countries”.
“There is a continuity to the relationship between the two countries, and it has always been to the detriment of Pakistan.”
Responding to a subsequent question, he also warned that in case of any violation on Pakistan’s eastern or western border — frontiers that the country shares with India and Afghanistan — Islamabad would respond effectively.
The defence minister further commented that Afghanistan had “chosen to become a stooge or proxy of India”.
Asked whether he saw a “broader or full-blown war” with Afghanistan on the horizon, the defence minister replied: “I won’t speculate about this, that there could be a full-blown war. But, there is a risk of [things] heating up, at least on the border. And obviously, if we have evidence of indulgence from across the border, we will retaliate. We will go inside and settle the score with them.”
The interviewer also asked him where Pakistan stood with regards to sending troops to become part of an international force in Gaza.
“We [have] already [said] on record that if need be we will be part of that force to maintain […] peace and tranquility and […] normalisation [of situation] in Gaza. Pakistan will always be willing to render its services in this regard,” replied Asif.
In response to a question about online “chatter” that Pakistan had tested a hypersonic missile over Quetta, the defence minister said it was just speculation.</p><small>2025-10-30 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30114923f35e0fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949314/stuck-in-a-loop-the-sisyphean-cycle-of-pakistans-power-sector' target='_blank'><strong>Stuck in a loop: The Sisyphean cycle of Pakistan’s power sector</strong></a><br><p>Albert Camus, a French philosopher, once wrote about Sisyphus, a king condemned by the Greek gods to push a boulder up a hill. Only, to his torment, the boulder rolled back down every time it reached the top, trapping him in an endless cycle. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent announcement of Pakistan’s largest financing arrangement — a Rs1.225 trillion deal with 18 local banks to settle power-sector arrears — echoes this tragic myth.
Though the deal appears promising, offering hope of freeing the country from the shackles of power debt, it remains Sisyphean in nature: the state pushes the boulder of circular debt uphill, only for it to roll back down again, crushing consumers under the weight of revised tariffs.
Watt a deal!
The recent Rs1.225 trillion package comprises Rs660 billion for the restructuring of old loans and Rs565 billion in fresh funds to clear overdue payments, primarily owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) — private companies that generate electricity and sell it to the national grid. This hefty loan, secured from a consortium of 18 local banks, will be repaid over six years through the existing Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) — a small per-unit charge on electricity bills — of Rs3.23 per unit.
The deal does look golden. It provides much-needed relief to lawmakers, who can now turn their attention to other pressing challenges — perhaps even to the absurdities of Pakistan’s tax structure. By paying off long-overdue energy liabilities, the government averts the risk of being lambasted by the IPPs with late payment surcharges, steadying the cash cycle and ultimately the availability of electricity.
 
 

It may also have spared Pakistan’s “Leviathan” of foreign debt from growing further by wisely turning to local banks instead of external lenders. This approach helps rebuild investor confidence and could open the door for new investments.
Moreover, the decision to repay the loan through a ring-fenced plan tied to an existing DSS, rather than introducing a new tax, makes the move easier to justify to the public. And there might even be a faint silver lining in the government’s claim of “freeing up” Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees — essentially a government’s promise to repay certain debts if public entities default. While this doesn’t mean new cash in hand, it does create accounting headroom, allowing funds to be directed towards other crucial sectors.
Lighting the same fire, again and again
The government, it seems, has thought this one through. Yet, as Camus once warned, “the absurd lies not in the effort itself, but in repeating it without resolution”.
This “heroic” fix isn’t new; just a more sophisticated version of an old script. Yet, it remains the least bad among a set of imperfect choices. In 2013, Pakistan cleared roughly Rs480 billion in power sector debt. Six years later, in 2019, it did it again, this time around Rs400 billion, through two Pakistan Energy Sukuks (PES-I and PES-II) — government-backed Islamic bonds issued to quickly raise cash and pay off overdue bills to power producers.
Each time, the move was celebrated as a decisive blow against the sector’s chronic malaise. And yet, like Sisyphus condemned to his eternal climb, the boulder kept rolling back, only heavier with every descent. Why? The reasons are many.
Imagine the power sector as a pipeline of money that needs to flow smoothly — from customers to distribution companies (Discos), then to the central buyer (CPPA), on to power plants, and finally to fuel suppliers. Debt builds up when not enough cash passes through this pipeline.
 
 

This shortfall arises from several factors: transmission losses due to outdated and shabby infrastructure, electricity theft, which entails consuming power without payment, fixed capacity payments that must be made to producers even when energy isn’t dispatched, and under-collection when billed amounts are not fully recovered. This leaves the Discos cash-strapped, who underpay the central buyer, which in turn underpays power producers and fuel suppliers; late payment surcharges then accrue, worsening the deficit. This growing pile of unpaid payments is, in essence, circular debt.
This vicious cycle, with every inefficiency feeding another, mirrors Sisyphus’ misery. Camus suggested we must imagine Sisyphus happy, for in his struggle, he has acknowledged the certainty of his fate. However, Pakistan doesn’t have that luxury, as this fiscal ferris wheel has far-reaching implications. Circular debt makes power costly, as tariffs are hiked to make up for the cash deficit. It results in frequent shutdowns as power producers fail to pay for the fuel required to run their plants. Moreover, it drains public funding through recurring bailouts and guarantees, diverting the budget away from social welfare projects.
The irony is that to cauterise this oozing wound, Pakistan itself has relied on circular measures and has failed to sheathe the sword that cuts it anew. Although the deal is a welcome step, it only buys us time, not reform. To escape Sisyphus’ ill fate, the power sector must use this allowance to atone for its structural flaws — persistent losses, under-collections, crippling capacity payments, and costly subsidies.
The real power reform lies beyond bailouts
This begins with expanding the deployment of smart AMI meters (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) to improve recovery and introducing prepaid systems in areas where electricity theft is chronic.
Inefficient generation companies (Gencos) need to be retired, with their gap filled by cheaper renewable alternatives, easing the burden of hefty capacity payments. The Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) must be fully operationalised to encourage competitive pricing, alongside a comprehensive upgrade of the national grid to curb power losses.
Above all, tariffs must be cost-reflective, priced at what power truly costs. This, however, must be paired with targeted subsidies to protect lifeline consumers. And perhaps the sine qua non of power sector reform lies in insulating Discos from political patronage, whether through outright privatisation or performance-based concessions.
None of these reforms are new. National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank (WB) have repeated them ad nauseam.
Yet, until power losses are curtailed, subsidies rationalised, and governance overhauled, Pakistan will continue to hail each bailout as a breakthrough — only to find itself condemned to a Sisyphean fate.

His remarks after the face-to-face talks with  China’s leader Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.
The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red carpet send off at the airport.
 






Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the meeting with Xi yielded an extendable one-year deal on the supply of crucial rare earths.
“All the rare earths has been settled, and that’s for the world,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the deal was for a year and would be re-negotiated annually.
He also described his meeting with Xi as a “great success” and said he would head to China in April for new talks.
“I’ll be going to China in April and he’ll be coming here sometime after that, whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, DC,” Trump said.
“A lot of things we brought to finalisation” at Thursday’s talks in Busan, South Korea, added Trump, praising Xi as a “tremendous leader of a very powerful country”.
Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak against the dollar as investors hoped for an easing of trade tensions that have upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence.
World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo have hit record highs in recent days.
Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates.
But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952075/warming-wired-world-becomes-playground-for-the-rich' target='_blank'><strong>‘Warming, wired world’ becomes playground for the rich</strong></a><br><p>

IN PAKISTAN, the wealthiest 10 per cent hold 42pc of the national income — lower than the average across major Asian economies, but still enough to create massive inequalities that make it impossible to build fair or sustainable societies.
This is one of the findings of an Oxfam report, highlighting uneven patterns of economic growth driven by widening wealth disparity, climate change and the digital divide.
Titled An Unequal Future: Asia’s Struggle for Justice in a Warming, Wired World, the report makes for grim reading: the richest 10pc capture 60-77pc of national income, while the poorest 50pc receive only 12-15pc; and the top 1pc own nearly half the wealth.
 






The report points out that in the past decade, the fortunes of Asian billionaires have more than doubled, whereas the poorest half of the population in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Korea, saw their share of income decline.

Oxfam report sees elite capture of wealth & income, climate crisis and digital divide as major challenges facing Asian nations

“The income share of the poorest 50pc has declined in almost all countries except Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam. The increase in these countries is also minimal, around 1pc, except in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myan­mar, the Philippines and Timor-Leste,” the report notes.
Dr Abid Aman Burki, who teaches poverty and inequality at Lahore University of Management Sciences, sees the report as a “bold attempt” at highlighting income and wealth disparities in the region.
“I think there is relevance for Pakistan,” notes Amitabh Behar, Executive Director at Oxfam International.
“Pakistan is among the countries in Asia hardest hit by floods and climate shocks, yet the richest continue to hoard wealth and dodge taxes, leaving ordinary people to face the worst of the destruction,” he told Dawn.
For the widening inequality in Pakistan, Dr Burki blames the current economic model. “It benefits the powerful elite with a tax system reliant on indirect taxes while disproportionately burdening low- and middle-income households.”
With public spending skewed towards debt repayment, defence, and subsidies for the elite, “there is very little left for health, education, and social protection” he added.
This assertion seems to be backed by Oxfam’s research: “In 2022, public investment in education amounted to 8pc of GDP in Bhutan and Kyrgyzstan, but less than 2pc of GDP in Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka,” the report states.
The report also details how indirect taxation disproportionately affects lower-income households. “In 2022, the tax-to-GDP ratio was at or above 30pc in Japan, Korea and New Zealand, compared to around 10pc in Laos and Pakistan.”
While countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have  moderate value-added taxes and strong social spending capacities, countries with high direct taxes, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, show continued reliance on indirect taxes. Hence, the burden still falls disproportionately on poorer households, it noted.
Climate, digital divide
However, economic reforms alone cannot close the widening gap between rich and poor; the climate crisis and the digital divide must also be addressed, as both deepen inequalities across the region, the report observes.
Nowhere is this more visible than in Asia, which the World Meterological Organisation terms the most “disaster-hit region”, recording over 1,800 events in the last decade, which claimed over 150,000 lives and affected over 1.2 billion.
Five of the world’s most vulnerable nations — Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — home to over 500 million people, bear the heaviest burden due to climate disasters.
To tackle and adapt to disasters, Asia requires around $1.11 trillion annually, but receives only $333bn, but much of this comes in the form of loans, the report notes ahead of the November COP30. “Wealthier nations continue to shirk their responsibility to pay for the climate damage they have caused in countries like Pakistan,” said Behar.
The report also emphasises the need to bridge the digital divide, which is largely defined by geography, affordability and social status. In the Asia-Pacific, 83pc of the urban population has access to the internet, compared to just 49pc in the rural areas.
“Across Asia, women, especially in South Asia, remain far less connected than men. Out of 885 million women in low- and middle-income countries not using mobile internet, 330 million live in South Asia,” the report states.
Pointing out the barriers such as affordability, low digital literacy, safety concerns, and unpaid care work, the report said these limit women’s access and exclude them from digital and tech-driven jobs.

It further reported that the arrangement for the astronaut was according to medium-term planning and cooperation progress of China’s space station mission. It added that the astronaut from Pakistan will train alongside Chinese astronauts.
 






China’s Global Times also reported that during the mission, the astronaut will not only participate in the crew’s routine work but will also conduct experiments on behalf of Pakistan.
 






In March, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the CMSA had signed a cooperation agreement for sending Pakistan’s first manned mission to China’s space station.
At the time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had stated the agreement was “another wonderful gesture” from the Chinese government to further deepen bilateral cooperation in the field of space.
In April, the premier had also Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology. He also stressed that Pakistan was “giving utmost importance to the space technology sector”, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631221-eighteen-india-backed-terrorists-killed-in-two-separate-balochistan-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 18 India-backed terrorists killed in two separate Balochistan IBOs</strong></a><br><p>

In his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the two sides agreed to launch economic framework, seeking to strengthen the role of both public and private sectors in promoting joint ventures.
Under the framework, several strategic and high-impact initiatives are being explored in sectors including energy, industry, mining and information technology
At the confere­nce, PM Shehbaz called for cooper­ation to support countries like Pakistan that have been battered by climate catastrophes, emp­hasising that loans should not be the only option for recovery.

While Mr Khan is in jail, it is not clear who has been running his social media account. However, he has never disowned the messages shared from his X account.
“The continued delay in issuing notifications for Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as Leaders of the Opposition is deeply concerning,” the post said. “I demand that they be immediately notified as Leaders of the Opposition in the Senate and the National Assembly, respectively.”
 






The post also praised recent political rallies and urged followers to continue their efforts.

PTI leaders meet Fazl, seek his support for election to Senate seat

The post noted that the large turnouts at rallies in Charsadda, Khyber, and Karak demonstrate rising public awareness and a commitment to protecting rights. It also expressed appreciation to the organisers for their successful public outreach efforts.
The message instructed that PTI, in collaboration with the Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aaeen-i-Pakistan movement, “must now accelerate the struggle for true freedom.”
The former prime minister also addres­­sed internal party matters, clarifying communication protocols and leadership roles.
“To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, all instructions and correspondence concerning the party matters shall be conveyed solely through the Secretary General Salman Akram Raja,” the post stated.
It also affirmed his support for two party members, saying, “Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. … I have not issued any orders for their removal.”
Separately, Mr Khan’s party condemned Israel’s recent airstrikes in Gaza.
PTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram called on the international community, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, “to take immediate, decisive, and collective action to halt Israel’s aggression”.
The PTI also criticised the Adiala Jail administration for ignoring a court order regarding visitation rights for Khan. Mr Akram reported that despite clear instructions from the Islamabad High Court, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi and others were denied access.  He urged the IHC to take decisive action against those violating its orders and to restore Imran Khan’s right to meet his family, legal team, and political associates.
PTI meets JUI-F leader
Meanwhile, a PTI delegation visited the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Islamabad.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, said he proposed holding a national jirga to address security concerns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Maulana Fazlur Rehman assured support for the proposal,” Mr Qaiser said.
 






The PTI delegation also advocated for uniting opposition parties in Parliament and reached a consensus to nominate Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader. They also requested the JUI-F’s support for a vacant Senate seat from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.

As tomato prices crashed to Rs200 per kg after rising to a record Rs600-700 per kg, onion prices are likely to remain under pressure in the coming days due to a demand-supply gap.
As soon as the prices of perishable and non-perishable commodities rise substantially, consumers restrict their purchases to their daily requirements rather than buying in bulk.
Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway President Haji Shahjehan said supplies of onion from the new Sindh crop have started on a low note, which may pick up pace by the third week of November. Still, till then, prices may remain on the higher side.
He claimed that a small quantity is also arriving from Iran. Still, prices in the neighbouring country are high, and reports are coming in about problems with the clearance of Iranian onions at the border.
Shahjehan said that the markets lack any supply from Afghanistan due to the closure of Pak-Afghan trade for the last two weeks after clashes at the border between the two countries.
“The wholesale markets have been facing a shortage of onions for the last few days due to thin arrivals from the Sindh crop and limited imports from Iran,” he said, adding that the wholesale price of the main staple food items of the kitchen has swelled to Rs6,000-6,500 per 40 kg from Rs3,000-3,500 a few days back.
Currently, exports of onions have also been suspended due to very high prices, he said.
As in past practice, daily item prices issued by the Commissioner Karachi never match market prices. The official retail rate of onions is Rs104 per kg, but it is available at Rs200-220 per kg.
Market traders said that onion prices have also risen in some cities of Punjab, with reports that a 105-kg bag is now available at Rs23,000. They added that the Sindh crop is also finding its way into the Punjab areas.
As per the Sensitive Price Index data ending Oct 2, the national average price of onion in various cities ranged from Rs55-140 per kg, rising to Rs65-160 per kg in the week ending Oct 23.Economic Survey FY25 suggests that onion production during FY25 surged by 16pc to 2.670 million tonnes from 2.304m tonnes in FY24.

• Dismisses claim about 400 to 600 deaths in Muridke protest
LAHORE: Apparently under pressure from some religious groups, the Punjab government on Wednesday announced handing over the administrative control of the mosques and seminaries erstwhile being run by proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to a group of moderate clerics.
The administration led by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier announced giving the administrative control of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries run by the TLP in the province to the Auqaf department.
Besides, CM Maryam ordered the release of TLP prisoners, who were fount innocent during the investigations.
At least eight people, including a policeman, were killed and over 1,600 injured in clashes between police and TLP supporters in Muridke earlier this month.
 
 

The Punjab police had arrested over 6,000 TLP activists so far following the violence, which was sparked by the outfit’s attempt to hold an anti-Israel demonstration outside the US embassy in Islamabad.
On Wednesday, a meeting of the Ittehad Bainul Muslimeen Committee was held with CM Maryam Nawaz in the chair.
Religious leaders from all schools of thought expressed full support for the Punjab government’s stance against the TLP and endorsed its efforts for maintaining peace.
 






In the meeting it was decided that the administration of the TLP-run mosques and seminaries would be handed over to the Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle Sunnat Pakistan led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
“Those who misuse religion for personal agendas are not serving the faith,” the CM noted.
“The mosques and seminaries are being handed over to Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman’s organisation for proper management,” she added.
Release of TLP supporters
The CM also ordered the immediate release of the TLP supporters, who were proven innocent, and instr­ucted officials to escort them home with “dignity”.
She dismissed the claim that 400 to 600 people were killed during the TLP protest in Muridke.
Referring to jailed former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, the Punjab CM said: “A person sitting in Adiala Jail tweets that 400 to 600 people died [in Muridke].”
She added that Mr Khan had been in jail for the last two years and still not stopped inciting sedition. “The lie of hundreds of people being killed was falsely spread. If it were true, where were the dead bodies?” she asked.
The CM further raised the question as to which hospitals provided medical treatment if thousands were injured.
“No videos of the injured and killed came to surface, but only those of raids and recoveries emerged,” she noted.
“When a police inspector was martyred, his funeral was held and everyone watched,” she continued, asking why were matters brought to such a tragic point that parents, wives, husbands and children were deprived of their loved ones.
The Punjab CM said everyone was surprised to see such a large number of weapons being recovered from TLP activists and supporters.
During police raids, she stated that modern weapons were recovered from TLP activists, including ones that even law enforcement agencies did not possess. “These arms were meant to be used against the state and the police.”
She denounced the harsh statements being made on social media about security personnel, adding that the agenda of those behind them was only to “defame religious and political parties”.
‘Miscreants creating divisions’
The CM observed that some people in religious groups were pious, guiding followers toward the truth. However, she asked: “who are those destroying property and taking innocent lives.”
She criticised the elements creating divisions among religious groups. She said certain miscreant groups were formed only to discredit and harm religious organisations.
“It is the state’s responsibility to protect the lives, property, and honour of citizens and to ensure daily life is not disrupted,” she added.
“The state was forced to act [against the TLP],” she said, continuing that while the world rejoiced over the Gaza ceasefire, some people in the country were calling for a march on Islamabad.
“Not once did these agitators [TLP] speak for Palestine. Instead, they incited violence against the police.”
She said using women as shields and hiding weapons in mosques was inhumane, referring to the TLP tactics.
The meeting was inf­o­rmed that all personnel deployed for the CM’s sec­urity were being screened following the crackdown against the TLP.
Besides, the security of the CM and some other members of her cabinet has been beefed up.
The CM announced a stipend of Rs25,000 per month for a prayer leader (imam) of each of the 65,000 mosques in the province.

• ‘N’ vows to support the motion, not PPP’s candidate
ISLAMABAD: While a joint no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
Informed sources told Dawn that although only 14 signatures are required to submit a no-confidence motion, the number of signatories is much higher. Those who have signed include PML-N’s AJK chief Shah Ghulam Qadir, its parliamentary leader in AJK Legi­s­lative Assembly Raja Far­ooq Hai­der, and all six members of the forward bloc aligned with AJK Pr­e­sident Barrister Sultan Mehmood.
The PML-N has agreed to support the motion but, according to party sources, will not vote for the new prime minister from the PPP. The party’s ministers are expec­ted to resign after submission of the motion, and will sit on the opposition benches.
A day after a meeting at the Presidency in Islamabad decided that the PPP would form the government in AJK after unseating Anwarul Haq, 10 members of the forward bloc joined the PPP ranks, placing the party in a position to remove the AJK prime minister even without PML-N’s backing.
The development has raised the PPP’s strength from 17 to 27 members, matching the magic figure need­ed for a majority in the 53-member house.
Also, Muh­a­mmad Iqbal, a UK-based busi­nessman elected on a rese­rved seat for overseas Kashmiris, reportedly resigned.
With PML-N’s support, the total number of members ready to vote out Anwarul Haq rises to 36. A PPP source, however, claimed that the party already enjoyed the ‘open support’ of 37 members, with more in contact.
TV channels, citing party sources, reported that the PPP finalised Chaudhry Yasin, the president of PPP AJK, as its nominee for the office of prime minister, though he denied the media reports later in a post on X. He said the PPP leadership had not formally announced its nominee.
Sources said the formal announcement of the PPP nominee will be made after a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which could not take place on Wednesday.
In a related development, President Zardari chaired a meeting of senior party leaders, attended by PPP Chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Chaudhry Yaseen, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, and former AJK prime minister Sardar Yaqoob Khan.
The meeting focused on the political situation in Azad Kas­hmir, particularly the no-confidence motion against Anwa­rul Haq and the formation of a PPP government.
A meeting of PPP’s AJK parliamentary party will be held on Friday (tomorrow) at Zardari House. According to informed sources, the meeting will be chaired by PPP chairman, and the name of the next AJK PM will be announced afterwards.

Despite seed companies adhering to all agreed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the movement of wheat seeds between provinces has reportedly been hindered.
To address the issue, a meeting was held on the prime minister’s directives in Islamabad on Wednesday. 
During the meeting, chaired by National Food Security and Research Secretary Amir Muhyuddin, the provincial food departments clarified that all seed convoys with the necessary movement documentation were being allowed, and assured that instructions had been issued to food department authorities to facilitate the movement of wheat seeds as a priority.
A high-level supervisory committee, led by Mr Muhyuddin, has also been established to meet weekly on Wednesdays to monitor and review the progress of the inter-provincial wheat seed movement.
Furthermore, it was decided that officers from the Federal Seed Certi-fication and Research and Develop-ment will be deputed at check-posts on all inter-provincial routes connecting Punjab to other provinces. 
These officers will assist the food departments in the timely verification and movement of wheat seeds across provincial borders.
The meeting was attended by the secretaries of provincial agriculture and food departments, directors general of agriculture, and senior officials from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij, a term designating members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, seven Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the statement read.
However, Captain Noman Saleem (24, resident of Mianwali), Havaldar Amjad Ali (39, resident of Swabi), Naik Waqas Ahmad (36, resident of Rawalpindi), Sepoy Aijaz Ali (23, resident of Shikarpur), Sepoy Muhammad Waleed (23, resident of Jhelum) and Sepoy Muhammad Shahbaz (32, resident of Khairpur) were all martyred in the gun battle.
Captain Noman was “a brave young medical officer who, besides performing the duties of medical care, also fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his five men,” the statement added.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as relentless counter terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
On Sunday, security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, according to the ISPR.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-10-29 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631158-captain-among-six-soldiers-martyred-seven-terrorists-killed-in-kps-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>Captain and 5 soldiers martyred, seven terrorists killed in KP's Kurram</strong></a><br><p>
