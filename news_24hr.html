Nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israeli strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13. Iran subsequently launched its own retaliation with ballistic missiles fired at Israel and the two countries continued to exchange a volley over the weekend.
Posts from multiple Indian and others users on social media platforms and Indian media outlets since Sunday shared a video of Iranian National Security Council member Mohsen Rezaei, claiming that he said Pakistan told Iran that if Israel drops a nuclear bomb on Tehran, Pakistan would retaliate in kind amid current tensions. However, fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan concluded that the video was doctored, and the Iranian official had not made any such statement.
Addressing the matter during today’s Senate session, FM Dar said, “There is a video on social media where an Iranian general was quoted as saying: ‘If Israel nuke attacks Iran, then Pakistan will attack [Israel] with nuclear weapons.’”
“This is irresponsible and false news,” he said, adding that the claims had become viral on the internet, and that even UK news outlet Daily Mail picked it up.
He said, “From our side, there has been no such statement. It was fabricated.”
 
 

He also addressed an alleged video of US President Donald Trump allegedly urging Pakistan to stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. Similarly, he said that a widely circulated interview of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, purported to be recent, was in fact from 2011. Such deceptive content is causing confusion and is being monitored closely by the Foreign Office, he told the Senate.
Dar said, “We have checked that it was an AI-generated clip and it was fake.”
He cautioned that everyone must be careful, saying, “This is not a children’s matter. This is a serious war like ours with India.”
 






Speaking on the Iran-Israel conflict, the foreign minister said, “We wanted the Iran-US [nuclear] talks to be successful. I must appreciate the foreign minister of Oman and Iran, who kept me in the loop throughout the process of the four rounds of talks in Muscat and Rome.”
Dar said that the Senate’s statement on the conflict was widely circulated around the world, stating, “[The] House of Federation took a strong stance. We fulfilled our responsibility with clarity.”
He further said that Pakistan facilitated the UN Security Council meeting within 24 hours of the attacks. He added that the Iranian ambassador at the meeting acknowledged four countries by name, including Pakistan.
Dar also said that he spoke to the Iranian foreign minister on the night of June 13/14, quoting him as saying, “We [Iran] are ready for diplomatic dialogue if Israel does not attack again.”
“We have conveyed the matter through different channels that Iran is ready if the other side can stop,” he added.
He highlighted some of the consequences for Pakistani students and zaireen (pilgrims) in Iran.
“On June 13, the crisis management unit of the foreign ministry was activated.
“We have so far evacuated 251 students. By tonight, they will reach Quetta. There are over 500 zaireen there. Three hundred of them travelled by air to go there while 209 went there by road,” he said, adding that Pakistan was in contact with other countries as well.
“Iran approached us on June 14 to help bring back 20,000 Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. We gave a positive response to this. Pakistan will give them a visa on arrival, and welcome them at Karachi airport … So we are fulfilling our responsibility.”
Dar also spoke on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, saying that Pakistan’s policy had not changed since 1998.
“Even at that time, we said that it is Pakistan’s stated policy. It is for the purpose of self-defence. It is our deterrence. It was important for parity, peace and security in this region,” he said, adding that India’s “spectacle of having hegemony and supremacy over us [Pakistan]” was buried on May 10, following the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
Dar further said, “We are not signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since 1998, our condition has been that we will sign it only when India does. So neither India nor Pakistan have signed it. Neither has Israel. But it is a serious crime to attack nuclear installations, whether you are a member or not.
“It is a major violation of international law due to the unimaginable consequences of attacking nuclear facilities.
The foreign minister reiterated that Pakistan’s “nuclear power is for our security and stability as well as regional stability.
“Israel dare not look at Pakistan. Pakistan has enough power to respond to any malafide [action]. Our armed forces are fully alert,” he added.
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the global community to be “wary and apprehensive” of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, amidst Tel Aviv’s aggression against its neighbours in the region.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and starving a besieged population — Israel has now expanded its assault across borders, launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
 






“(The) world should be wary and apprehensive about Israel’s nuclear prowess, a country not bound by any international nuclear discipline, nor signatory to NPT or any other binding arrangement,” he said in a post on X.
“We do not pursue hegemonic policies against our neighbours, which are being amply demonstrated by Israel these days,” Asif continued, referring to Israel’s aggression in the region,.
The defence minister added that Pakistan was a signatory to all international nuclear disciplines.
“Our nuclear capability is for the benefit of our people and defence of our country against the hostile designs of our enemies,” Asif said.
Asif said that the Western world must worry about conflicts being generated by Israel, adding that it would engulf the whole region and beyond.
“Their patronage of Israel, a rogue state, can have catastrophic consequences,” Asif warned.
Israel was able to produce nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s. It is estimated that there are about 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads in this country and that Israel has produced enough plutonium for 100-200 weapons.
Tel Aviv is not a party to the NPT — a 1970 accord aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament, and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
 
 

“Although Israel refrains from informing the international community about whether it possesses nuclear weapons, it is the only country in the Middle East that has not accepted the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which allows the IAEA to inspect all kinds of civilian and military nuclear facilities and to carry out verification activities for the work carried out,” Heinz Gartner, a professor from the University of the Vienna told Anadolu Agency.
Pakistan is also not a signatory to the NPT but frequently reiterates its commitment to nuclear safety and non-proliferation principles through other international frameworks.</p><small>2025-06-17 00:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16234820d05453a.jpg?r=000705' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917514/in-pictures-death-destruction-debris-in-iran-and-israel-amid-war' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Death, destruction, debris in Iran and Israel amid war</strong></a><br><p>Israel and Iran have been trading missile strikes since the former launched an air offensive on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon. The ongoing conflict has caused widespread destruction in both nations.

“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”
The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.
 






Iran’s Mehr news agency posted visuals from the attack on the IRIB building on X.
 






Iran’s Press TV also shared a video showing the aftermath of the attack.
 






IRNA reported that “live programmes were briefly halted at the IRIB News Network but returned to normal a few minutes afterwards”.
 






The attack came shortly after Iranian media reported Israeli airstrikes in a civilian residential neighbourhood in Tehran.
 






Iran condemned Israel’s attack as a “war crime” and called on the UN Security Council to take action.
The strike on the offices of IRIB during a live broadcast was a “wicked act” and a “war crime”, said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei. “The UNSC must act now to stop the genocidal aggressor from committing further atrocities against our people,” he added.

Iran subsequently issued evacuation warnings for Israeli news channels, Iranian state TV reported.
“Iran has issued an evacuation warning for the N12 and N14 channels of Israel. This order comes in response to the hostile attack of Zionist enemy against the Islamic Republic of Iran’s broadcasting service,” state TV said.
Iran’s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the UNSC that Iran’s strikes on Israel were self-defence and were “proportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure”.
He wrote in a letter that any cooperation by third countries with Israel’s strikes on Iran “makes them complicit in the legal responsibility and consequences of this crisis”. Under Article 51 of the founding United Nations Charter, the 15-member Security Council must immediately be informed of any action that states take in self-defence against armed attack.
Separately, Iranian media outlets IRNA and Mehr claimed that the air defence in Tabriz shot down another Israeli F-35 fighter jet.
“This was the 4th Israeli F-35 fighter jet downed by Iran,” Mehr reported.
 






Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was “on the road to victory” and claimed that his air force was “in control of the skies over Tehran”, Al Jazeera reported.
Netanyahu made the remarks as he visited the Tel Nof airbase in central Israel, accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, according to the Israeli media.
“We are on our way to achieving our two objectives: eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat,” he said. Netanyahu also threatened the citizens of Tehran, telling them to leave Iran’s capital. “We are taking action.”
The latest military exchange between the arch-rivals began when Israel struck Iran’s nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top commanders and scientists. Tel Aviv has said it wants to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Dangers of further escalation loomed over a meeting of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done, but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.
Today, he said that Iran wanted to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, and should do so immediately “before it’s too late”.
“I’d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it’s too late,” Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In turn, Iran called on Trump to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war
“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.
“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”
 






Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.
The foreign ministers from France, Britain and Germany are expected to hold a call with Aragchi soon, a European diplomatic source said.
The three countries, known as the E3, are party to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and last week put forward a resolution that was approved by the UN watchdog’s Board of Governors, which declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations.
Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted an evacuation order for citizens in Tehran on his X account.
The post ordered citizens living in a specific area of the Iranian capital to “leave immediately”, warning that Israel would attack Iran’s military infrastructure in the area.
“Dear citizens, for your safety, please leave the mentioned area in the third district of Tehran immediately,” the order read, enclosing a map of the city. “Your presence in this area endangers your life.”
 






Katz also said that  Iran’s state television and radio were “about to disappear”, after the evacuation warning was issued for the district in Tehran where the broadcaster is based.
“The Iranian propaganda and incitement megaphone is about to disappear,” he said in a statement. “Evacuation of nearby residents has begun.”
The area marked for evacuation is an upmarket part of the Iranian capital home to at least four hospitals and medical centres, a major police building and state broadcaster IRIB. It also houses several embassies, including those of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait, as well as UN offices and the AFP bureau.
Earlier today, Katz threatened that residents of Tehran will “pay the price and soon” after Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa before dawn, killing at least eight people.
“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,” Katz wrote on X.
 


Israeli officials said 11 people were killed by Iranian missiles overnight, taking the overall death toll since the attacks began on Friday to 24.
Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by Anadolu Agency.
More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour said on X.
At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel’s strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.
US warship reported heading toward Mideast
The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was leaving Southeast Asia on Monday after cancelling plans to dock in Vietnam, amid reports it is headed to the Middle East to boost the US presence.
At 1:45pm GMT (6:45pm PKT), the carrier was traveling through the Malacca Strait toward the Indian Ocean, according to Marine Traffic, a ship-tracking site.
A Vietnamese government official confirmed to AFP that a planned reception aboard the USS Nimitz on June 20, as part of the ship’s expected June 19-23 visit to Danang, had been cancelled.
The official shared a letter from the US embassy announcing that the Defence Department was cancelling the event due to “an emergent operational requirement.” The US Embassy in Hanoi declined to comment to AFP, as did a spokesman for the Nimitz.
PM Shehbaz meets Iranian ambassador
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amir Moqadam on the sidelines of the International Maritime Expo and Conference in Karachi, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.
The statement said, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression on Iran and the entire nation’s sympathy with Iran over the deaths of innocent people.”
While discussing the current regional situation, the premier expressed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran and its people during the tense situation, the statement added.
Russia and Turkiye offer to mediate, condemn Israeli attacks
As the attacks did not seem to halt, Russia and Turkiye offered to facilitate the end of the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call today that his country “stands ready to undertake a facilitating role to end the conflicts as soon as possible and return to nuclear negotiations”.
Erdoğan “emphasised the importance Turkiye attaches to the preservation of peace and stability in the region”, the Turkish presidency said.
The Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow’s previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.
Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.
“This proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“You know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,” Peskov stated.
He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.
“And secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,” Peskov added.
Stating that Russia “remains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis”, Peskov said the situation was “escalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better”.
Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks to Fox News on Sunday that regime change in Iran could be a result of Israel’s military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.
The statement comes after Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help. Speaking to ABC News, Trump said he would be open to Putin being a mediator in the conflict. “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” the US president had said.
The European Union said Russia has “zero credibility” as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel after Trump suggested that Putin could play a role.
“There has been a recent Russia-Iran partnership agreement, which signals deepening cooperation across multiple areas, including foreign policy and defence,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
“In light of such, Russia cannot be an objective mediator.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel’s “act of force” against Iran and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities when they spoke by phone on Monday, the Kremlin said.
“Both sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,” a Kremlin statement said.
“The leaders spoke in favour of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the settlement of contentious issues, including those related to the Iranian nuclear programme, exclusively by political and diplomatic means.”
The two sides agreed to remain in close cooperation, the statement said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call on Monday that the conflict between Iran and Israel must end and room must be made for diplomacy as soon as possible, the Turkish presidency said.
In a statement, the presidency also said Erdogan repeated his view that the only solution to the crisis was a return to nuclear talks.
Fires in Haifa, more buildings destroyed in Tel Aviv
Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.
Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.
 


Israel’s military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.
It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.
Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred metres from the US Embassy branch in the city.
The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.
British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port, Reuters reported.
Meanwhile, an Israeli official said after a gag order was lifted that an Iranian missile struck an oil refinery in Haifa on Sunday, killing three people.
The confirmation on Monday removed reporting restrictions imposed by Israel’s military censorship on the attack.
Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the the sprawling complex early today, according to an AFP journalist.

Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.
An AFP journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an AFP journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.
Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.

The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.
A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.
Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news outlet termed the latest strikes on Israel the “heaviest missile attacks” since last week. It added that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had “apparently employed the ‘Fattah’ hypersonic ballistic missiles in the latest operation”.
Iran does not seek nuclear weapons: president
Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s religious edict against weapons of mass destruction.
Iran had claimed the existence of the fatwa for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.
While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity “more than ever” against the Israeli aggression, Press TV reported.

Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation’s interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.
“We have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations — for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,” he further said.
The president said the US violated international norms by “allowing” Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.
“The enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,” Pezeshkian said.
“For every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,” he added.
On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel’s attacks, Pezeshkian asked: “What crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?”
More commanders killed in Iran
IRGC intelligence chief General Mohammad Kazemi, his deputy Gen Hassan Mohaqqeq, and Gen Mohsen Baqeri were among those killed in Israel’s attacks on Sunday, the IRGC said.
 


The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.
Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran’s holy city of Mashhad in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.
Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.
Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.
“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.
According to AFP, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.
“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.
His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.
Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported AFP.
The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official Fars news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.
The execution is the third in recent weeks related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.
Iranian media, including Tasnim, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.
‘I will not leave’
In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.
“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.
“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”
Some, however, were determined to stay.
“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told AFP.
AFP images from Israel’s Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.
 






The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.
Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.
“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.
“It was a miracle we survived.”
Trump vetoes plan to target Khamenei: report
In Washington, two US officials told Reuters that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Khamenei.
“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told AFP.
When asked about the Reuters report, Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”
“We do what we need to do,” he told Fox’s ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’.
Asked whether regime change in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.
In the same interview, The Independent reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice “through proxies”.
“Through their intel, yes; they want to kill him,” he added. “He’s enemy number one,” the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.
Today, Netanyahu suggested that assassinating Khamenei would “end the conflict” between the two arch-foes.
“It’s not going to escalate the conflict, it’s going to end the conflict,” Netanyahu told ABC News in an interview when asked about reports that Trump vetoed the Israeli plan out of concern it would intensify the Iran-Israel showdown.
“The ‘forever war’ is what Iran wants, and they’re bringing us to the brink of nuclear war,” Netanyahu said. “In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.”

Trump has lauded Israel’s offensive but said Washington had nothing to do with it, while threatening to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.
However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully coordinated”.
Trump has urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to fight it out” first.
Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported the same.
FM Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.
He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”. “If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.
Iran scrapped planned nuclear talks with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.</p><small>2025-06-16 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16233207272e9e5.jpg?r=233211' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917517/passerby-killed-5-injured-as-extortion-related-firing-erupts-in-karachis-surjani-police' target='_blank'><strong>Passerby killed, 5 injured as extortion-related firing erupts in Karachi’s Surjani: police</strong></a><br><p>Armed men killed one person and injured five others on Monday after they opened fire over non-payment of extortion in Karachi’s Surjani Town, according to the police.
West Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tariq Illahi Mastoi told Dawn.com that “two suspects on a motorcycle resorted to an indiscriminate firing on a restaurant,” killing a rickshaw driver and injuring five others.
He added that the police registered a first information report (FIR) under Sections 34 (common intention), 302 (intentional murder), 324  (attempted murder), 384 (punishment for extortion) and 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown suspects and launched an investigation.
According to the FIR, the complainant, the restaurant operator, said that he had received a phone call on the restaurant’s cell number on May 30 during which the caller demanded extortion, adding that he had informed the police but did not lodge an FIR.
He said that two armed suspects on a bike resorted to firing near the restaurant today, killing one passerby and injuring five others.
After 20 minutes of the incident, the complainant said he received the cell phone call at the restaurant and the caller claimed that they had attacked the restaurant. The complainant added that the caller also threatened him with “dire consequences if the Rs3 million extortion was not paid.”
The dead body and the injured were moved to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the condition of the injured people was out of danger.
Surjani Station House Officer Mohammed Ali Shah said that the police had some clues about the identity of the attackers, adding they were working on arresting them.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16233358c689d92.jpg?r=233623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917518/harvard-wins-extension-of-court-order-blocking-trumps-international-student-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Harvard wins extension of court order blocking Trump’s international student ban</strong></a><br><p>A federal judge said on Monday that she would issue a brief extension of an order temporarily blocking United States President Donald Trump’s plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the US to study at Harvard University while she decides whether to issue a longer-term injunction.
US District Judge Allison Burroughs, at the end of a hearing in Boston in Harvard’s legal challenge to the restrictions, extended to June 23 a temporary restraining order that had been set to expire on Thursday. She said she wanted to give herself more time to prepare a ruling.
“We’ll kick out an opinion as soon as we can,” she said.
Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told her that an injunction was necessary to ensure Trump’s administration could not implement his latest bid to curtail the school’s ability to host international students.
The judge scheduled the hearing after issuing a temporary restraining order on June 6, preventing the administration from implementing a proclamation that Trump had signed a day earlier. A preliminary injunction would provide longer-term relief to Harvard.
Gershengorn argued that Trump signed the proclamation to retaliate against Harvard in violation of its free speech rights under the US Constitution’s First Amendment for refusing to accede to his administration’s demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.
“The proclamation is a plain violation of the First Amendment,” Gershengorn said.
Almost 6,800 international students attended Harvard in its most recent school year, making up about 27 per cent of the student population of the prestigious school located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. China and India are among the top countries of origin for these students.
The Trump administration has launched a multifront attack on the oldest and wealthiest US university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.
Harvard has filed two separate lawsuits before Burroughs seeking to unfreeze $2.5 billion in funding and to prevent Trump’s administration from blocking the ability of international students to attend the university.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on May 22 announced that her department was immediately revoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Programme certification, the governmental mechanism that allows it to enrol foreign students.
Her action was almost immediately blocked by Burroughs. While the Department of Homeland Security has since shifted to challenging Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process, Burroughs at a May 29 hearing said she planned to issue a “broad” injunction to maintain the status quo.
A week later, though, Trump signed his proclamation, which cited national security concerns to contend that Harvard is “no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programmes”.
The proclamation suspended the entry of foreign nationals to study at Harvard or participate in exchange visitor programmes for an initial period of six months and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether to revoke visas of international students already enrolled at Harvard.
Harvard has asked Burroughs, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, to block Trump’s directive.
In court papers, the US Justice Department urged Burroughs not to lump Trump’s proclamation in with the judge’s consideration of Noem’s actions, as it did not ban existing students and Trump relied on different legal authority for his order.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16225854cfc0cb1.jpg?r=225947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917511/618-more-pakistanis-repatriated-from-iran-iraq-amid-middle-east-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>618 more Pakistanis repatriated from Iran, Iraq amid Middle East crisis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday repatriated another 618 nationals from both Iran and Iraq amid Tehran’s ongoing conflict with Israel, according to the Foreign Office (FO) and a district official in Balochistan.
A day ago, the government was able to repatriate 450 zaireen (pilgrims) from Iran, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq. Arrangements were made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.
The move came after Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Around 350 Pakistani pilgrims stranded in Iran returned to their homeland on Monday after crossing the border at Taftan, according to a district official in Balochistan.
Chagai Deputy Commissioner Attaul Muneem told Dawn.com that 350 Pakistanis, including 45 students and 305 pilgrims, crossed the border and that arrangements have been made to house them at Pakistan House in Taftan.
“The pilgrims and students who have arrived are being sent to Quetta,” he added.
In a statement from his office, Muneem said that Pakistanis stranded in Iran are attempting to cross the land border due to the conflict.
“The district administration is arranging medical care, food, accommodation and travel facilities in Taftan so that Pakistanis returning from Iran do not face any difficulties,” the DC was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, the FO successfully repatriated 268 Pakistani zaireen through two special flights from the Iraqi city of Basra to Karachi and Islamabad, according to a statement.
The ministry said it is working closely with Iraqi Airways and Iraqi authorities to repatriate the zaireen and ensure their “safe and timely return”.
“All Pakistani zaireen currently in Iraq are advised to remain in close contact with the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad, designated mandoobs (representatives) and their respective airlines for timely updates regarding their travel arrangements,” the statement read.
The FO said that Iraqi Airways is operating daily flights on the Basra–Dubai route, which the zaireen used to return to Pakistan.
“Those interested in travelling via this route are encouraged to contact the nearest Iraqi Airways office for booking and assistance,” the statement read.
“All zaireen are further advised to remain prepared for travel at short notice,” the FO said, adding that it is monitoring the situation closely and “remains fully committed to facilitating the safe and orderly return of all Pakistani zaireen”.
On the day of the Israeli strikes, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani zaireen in Iran following Israel’s deadly strikes.
In light of the PM’s directives, a Crisis Management Cell was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.
The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and actively assist the pilgrims. Earlier today, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy’s hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16221503376cd2c.jpg?r=222540' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917510/peshawar-court-sentences-serial-killer-rapist-to-death-life-imprisonment-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar court sentences ‘serial killer, rapist’ to death, life imprisonment: police</strong></a><br><p>A Peshawar child protection court on Monday sentenced a suspect to death and life imprisonment over charges of rape and serial killing carried out in July 2022.
In 2022, police had arrested a man in Peshawar on charges of sexually assaulting three minor girls and killing two of them.
Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general of police (IG) Moazzam Jah Ansari had told reporters that the 20-year-old embroiderer had confessed to sexual assaults and murders. The suspect was declared a serial killer by the police, who also said that he sexually assaulted the girls before killing them and dumping the bodies.
In a press release today, KP police said that the province’s “first serial killer and rapist was sentenced to death and life imprisonment through an excellent police investigation”.
“The suspect — involved in the July 2022 rape and serial killing cases — was sentenced to death five times by the child protection court,” the statement added.
 
 

KP IG Zulfiqar Hameed congratulated the joint investigation and operations team for conducting an excellent and coordinated investigation, preparing a case based on digital, forensic and other evidence and getting the accused convicted by the court, the statement said.
He also announced cash prizes and commendation certificates to the team, it added.
The statement detailed the suspect’s crimes and said that the “tragic incidents of rape and murder of three innocent girls” in 2022, had created fear and panic in the area, adding the case had remained unsolved for the police.
Former senior superintendent of police (SSP) Operations Kashif Aftab Abbasi and SSP Investigation Shahzada Kokab Farooq had formed special operations and investigation teams comprising police, scientific experts and forensic experts, it said.
The statement added that the team had examined all aspects of the cases, including call data records, geo-fencing, forensics, and digital material such as 3,000 minutes of camera recordings, using traditional and non-traditional methods.
The team arrested the suspect based on the data, the statement said, adding that the suspect’s semen sample matched with the samples found on the bodies of the victims, revealing that he was the “heinous person who committed the atrocities”.
“The police presented the accused in court after building a strong case containing all the evidence, where the suspect confessed to his heinous crime before the court,” it said, adding that the case was prosecuted by Deputy Public Prosecutor Arif Bilal.
“Police investigation plays a key role in delivering justice through the courts. In the face of indelible evidence, no accused can escape punishment,” IG Hameed was quoted as saying in the statement.
This case was a testament to the investigative skills of the officers of the KP Police, he added.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Earlier this month, a prayer leader was booked for allegedly sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy inside a mosque in KP’s Charsadda district.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609522-pakistanis-return-from-iran-via-taftan-amid-tehran-tel-aviv-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Hundreds of Pakistanis return from Iran via Taftan amid Tehran-Tel Aviv strikes</strong></a><br><p>

The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was seeking $29 billion in funding for 2025 compared to the $44bn originally requested in December, in a “hyper-prioritised” appeal.
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said later on Monday that it would have to terminate 3,500 jobs, cutting 30 per cent of its workforce costs, as aid funding evaporates.
Since US President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the United States — the world’s top donor — has heavily slashed foreign aid, causing havoc in the humanitarian sector across the globe.
Drastic US funding cuts have had dramatic consequences for emergency aid, vaccination campaigns and the distribution of drugs to fight AIDS.
Other major donor countries have also cut back their contributions in the face of an uncertain economic outlook.
“Brutal funding cuts leave us with brutal choices,” OCHA chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
“All we ask is one per cent of what you chose to spend last year on war.”
‘Cruel’, ‘heartbreaking’
In late April, while visiting a hospital in Kandahar in Afghanistan, Fletcher warned: “The impact of aid cuts is that millions die.”
Almost halfway through 2025, the UN has received only $5.6bn out of the $44bn originally sought for this year — a mere 13pc.
In total, the original plan covered more than 70 countries and aimed to assist nearly 190 million vulnerable people.
Even so, that plan acknowledged that there were 115 million people the UN would not be able to reach.
“We have been forced into a triage of human survival,” Fletcher said on Monday.
The mathematics “is cruel, and the consequences are heartbreaking”.
“Too many people will not get the support they need, but we will save as many lives as we can with the resources we are given,” he said.
Aid will now be directed so that it can “reach the people and places facing the most urgent needs”, with those in “extreme or catastrophic conditions” as the starting point, said Fletcher.
‘Red alert’
Fletcher’s call came as the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) issued a joint early warning report identifying worsening hunger in 13 hotspots.
Sudan, the Palestinian territories, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali have communities “already facing famine, at risk of famine or confronted with catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity”, said the report.
“The devastating crises are being exacerbated by growing access constraints and critical funding shortfalls,” it said.
Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria are now considered of very high concern and requiring urgent attention to save lives, it added, with Burkina Faso, Chad, Somalia and Syria the other hotspots.
“This report is a red alert,” said WFP chief Cindy McCain. “Without funding and access, we cannot save lives. Urgent, sustained investment in food assistance and recovery support is crucial as the window to avert yet more devastating hunger is closing fast.”
Refugee agency slashes jobs
Washington previously made up more than 40pc of the UNHCR refugee agency’s budget — $2bn per year, the agency’s chief Filippo Grandi told the UN Security Council in April.
“In light of difficult financial realities, UNHCR is compelled to reduce the overall scale of its operations,” Grandi said in Monday’s statement.
UNHCR estimates that it will end 2025 with available funding at about the same level as a decade ago — despite the number of people forced to flee their homes having nearly doubled over the same period to more than 122 million.
“In total, approximately 3,500 staff positions will be discontinued,” the statement said, while hundreds of temporary workers have gone already.
“Overall, UNHCR estimates a global reduction in staffing costs of around 30pc,” the agency said.</p><small>2025-06-16 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609516-pm-shehbaz-calls-blue-economy-pakistans-new-economic-frontier' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls blue economy Pakistan's 'new economic frontier'</strong></a><br><p>

Barkhan Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Khosa told Dawn.com, “The explosive material was planted in a motorcycle parked in the main market of Rakhni, Barkhan district. It resulted in the death of two people and injured 11 others.”
Four of the injured were in critical condition and were immediately taken to a hospital Dera Ghazi Khan for treatment, Khosa said.
He added that nearby shops, buildings, and one car were also damaged by the blast.
“An emergency has been imposed in all hospitals across Barkhan following the blast, while police, Levies and Frontier Corps (FC) personnel reached the site of the incident and began collecting evidence,” he said, adding that law enforcement agencies have also cordoned off the area and begun a search for the suspects
A similar incident occurred in March when four people were killed and five others were injured when an improvised explosive device (IED) attached to a motorbike went off in a market in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district.
Police said the explosive was attached to a motorcycle and detonated remotely after the bike was parked beside a car.
Meanwhile, the DC visited the injured in Rakhni hospital and chaired an emergency meeting with doctors and medical staff, according to a statement from his office.
Khosa also inspected the Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies personnel and received a briefing.

Last week, Sindh Chief Minister Shah Murad had also warned that the PPP — a coalition partner of the PML-N-led federal government —  would not support the passage of the federal budget in parliament if Islamabad continued to manage development schemes in Sindh instead of transferring them to the provincial government.
“The federal government has wronged us. They have dissolved the Public Works Department (PWD), which was responsible for overseeing development projects across provinces,” Murad had said, adding that while the other three provinces received funding for development projects accompanied by their budgets, Sindh was completely overlooked.
Senator Marri, chairing a meeting of the Senate Planning and Development Committee today, questioned why Sindh was “being treated like a colony of the federation,” as the committee protested the exclusion of PWD from development projects.
Her comments came after Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said during the last meeting of the committee that “federal execution agencies for each project decide who they are more comfortable working with — federal government or provincial. And we have distributed projects based on only that.”
“It was decided that PWD projects would be given to Sindh,” Marri said. “The same was decided in the National Economic Council, that PWD projects will be given to provinces.”
“Now, these projects are being given to every province except Sindh,” Marri lamented, adding that the Sindh government was “very concerned about this move from the federation”.
Senator Marri highlighted that Sindh was being treated unfairly despite being promised its rights.
“All provinces should be treated equally and be given control of projects,” she added.</p><small>2025-06-16 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609504-pti-contacts-ppp-to-skip-voting-for-budget-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>PTI contacts PPP to skip voting for budget FY26</strong></a><br><p>

Hasina, 77, fled Dhaka by helicopter to India in August 2024 at the culmination of a student-led mass uprising. She has defied an extradition order to return to Bangladesh.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a crackdown in a failed bid to cling to power, according to the United Nations.
Hasina and former senior figures connected to her ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League, are being prosecuted in
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).
Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina, including abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder — charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.
“The court directed the prosecution team to issue a notice as soon as possible summoning them to appear before the court,” chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said on Monday.
The trial will resume on June 24 without her if she fails to return.
The prosecution argues that Hasina ordered security forces, through directives from the interior ministry and police, to crush the protests.
Hasina is on trial with two other officials.
One of them, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who faces similar charges, is also a fugitive.
The second, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, is in custody and was in court on Monday.
The prosecution of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power.
The interim government has said it will hold elections in April 2026, although some parties are pushing for an earlier vote.</p><small>2025-06-16 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16183648b29f826.png?r=183722' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917507/icc-unveils-2025-womens-cricket-world-cup-schedule' target='_blank'><strong>ICC unveils 2025 Womens cricket World Cup schedule</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday announced the schedule for the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 set to be held in India and Sri Lanka in September.
Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
Hosts India will get the tournament underway against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru on September 30 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, with action starting at 3pm local time, according to the schedule.
 






Defending champions Australia then get their campaign up and running against neighbours New Zealand at Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore on October 1, while Pakistan will face Bangladesh a day later in Colombo.
The highly anticipated India-Pakistan clash is set for October 5, after which Pakistan will play Australia on the 8th, England on the 15th, New Zealand on the 18th, South Africa on the 21st and Sri Lanka on the 24th.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.
ICC Chairman Jay Shah said: “The confirmation of the schedule only builds further excitement and anticipation” for the world cup.
“With the eight best teams in the women’s game descending on India, alongside incredible venues and what promises to be record-breaking crowds, we are all looking forward to an unforgettable tournament.”

“On 15-16 June 2025, five Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna-al-Khwarij, were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement.
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan
“An intelligence-based operation was conducted by the security forces in Peshawar district on the reported presence of Indian-sponsored khwarij”,
it said.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops skillfully surrounded and effectively engaged the Indian-sponsored khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khwarij, including kharji Haris and kharji Baseer, were sent to hell.
Another IBO was conducted in North Waziristan district, the ISPR said, with security forces killing another terrorist.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in terrorist activities.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces in a post on X, lauding them for carrying out the operations against Indian-sponsored terrorists.
“Security forces carried out timely operations and killed five Indian-sponsored terrorists,” he wrote. “We salute the brave personnel of the security forces. We appreciate the successful operations of the security forces against Indian-sponsored terrorists and their backers.”
Stating that every Pakistani stands against terrorism, Naqvi wrote, “With the support of the nation, we will completely wipe out Indian-sponsored terrorism.”
 






Earlier this month, 14 “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in North Waziristan, the military’s media wing said.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-16 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/161817263ddb4b3.jpg?r=181751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917504/arshad-nadeem-named-in-forbes-30-under-30-asia-list' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem named in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list</strong></a><br><p>Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia list following his historic Olympic performance at the Paris 2024 Olympics, it emerged on Monday.
The entertainment and sports list, which was originally published last month, aims to “[spotlight] the next generation of talent — on court and the screen.”
Nadeem, 28, changed Pakistan’s sporting trajectory when he won gold and broke the Olympic record with a massive 92.97m throw in Paris — which Forbes called a “stunning show” — winning Pakistan’s first individual gold medal and the first of any colour in more than 30 years.
His Olympic feat got him more than Rs153 million in cash prize from Punjab and Sindh, in addition to several other rewards handed out by various government entities and companies.
The government also named a road in Islamabad in Nadeem’s honour, while Pakistan Post issued a commemorative stamp on Independence Day to pay tribute.
 
 

Nadeem retained his javelin supremacy when he took home gold at last month’s Asian Athletic Championships with a 86.40m throw, narrowly missing out on the meet record of 86.72m.
His triumph marked the first time Pakistan won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in more than 50 years.
Nadeem rose to prominence after he bagged gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, followed by a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.
He will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.</p><small>2025-06-16 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609487-iran-ready-for-talks-if-israel-halts-attacks-says-ishaq-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Iran ready for talks if Israel halts attacks, says Ishaq Dar</strong></a><br><p>

In a town hall held at the headquarters of the Tata Group-owned airline near New Delhi and attended by 700 staff, Chandrasekaran said the crash was the “most heartbreaking” crisis of his career, a spokesperson told Reuters.
“I’ve seen a reasonable number of crises in my career, but this is the most heartbreaking one,” he said, according to a transcript provided by a Tata Group spokesperson.
“We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline,” Chandrasekaran said.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday, and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
All but one on board were declared dead in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade, and around 30 people died on the ground.
The airline and the Indian government are looking at several aspects of the crash, including the plane’s engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.
“We need to wait for the investigation … It’s a complex machine, so a lot of redundancies, checks and balances, certifications, which have been perfected over years and years. Yet this happens, so we will figure out why it happens after the investigation,” Chandrasekaran, 62, said during the staff meeting.
He is also the chairman of the Tata Group conglomerate.
The crash poses a new challenge for both Air India, which has for years been trying to revamp its ageing fleet, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
After taking the carrier over from the government in 2022, the Tata Group unveiled its investment plans to create a “world-class airline” after years of financial losses, persistent flight delays and poor maintenance under government ownership.
On Monday, an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane bound for New Delhi returned to its origin of Hong Kong shortly after takeoff on Monday following a technical issue.
“It’s not easy to face criticisms,” Chandrasekaran said. “We are going to get through this. We need to show resilience.”</p><small>2025-06-16 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16154347f79d94f.png?r=154414' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917488/sbp-maintains-11pc-interest-rate-amid-mideast-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>SBP maintains 11pc interest rate amid Mideast conflict</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate on Monday at 11 per cent, after many analysts cited inflation risks from rising global commodity prices amid Iran-Israel tensions.
The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was cut to 11pc last month.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent,” the SBP said in a statement.
Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict.
 
 

The MPC observed that global oil prices had “rebounded sharply, reflecting the evolving geopolitical situation in the Middle East and some ease in US-China trade tensions”.
“Taking stock of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real interest rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc,” the MPC stressed.
The escalating hostilities after Israel’s attacks on Iran on Friday had triggered a sharp spike in oil prices — a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll by Reuters expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12pc. Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.
Inflation expected to ‘trend up and stablise’ in 5-7pc target range
On inflation, the MPC noted that the recent uptick in May to 3.5pc year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined “marginally”.
The headline inflation had hit an all-time low of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from around 40pc in May 2023.
 
 

The MPC said inflation was expected to “trend up and stabilise” in the target range. The SBP expects average inflation to range between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the current fiscal year, which ends this month.
“This outlook, however, remains subject to multiple risks emanating from potential supply-chain disruptions from regional geopolitical conflicts, volatility in oil and other commodity prices, and the timing and magnitude of domestic energy price adjustments,” the committee added.
It noted that economic growth was picking up gradually and was projected to gain further traction next year on the back of earlier rate cuts. However, the MPC cautioned about “some potential risks to the external sector amidst the sustained widening in the trade deficit and weak financial inflows”.
It observed that some of the proposed FY26 budgetary measures may further widen the trade deficit by increasing imports, adding that the decision to maintain the interest rate was “appropriate to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability”.
The MPC termed the “timely realisation of planned foreign inflows, achievement of the targeted fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms as essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable economic growth”.
 
 

“The decision to hold rates was not surprising given the uncertain geopolitical outlook with oil prices spiking around 15pc,” said Mustafa Pasha, executive director at Karachi-based Lakson Investments.
“Additionally, it gives the SBP time to assess the impact of the budget and upcoming gas/electricity tariff revisions on inflation and the external account.”
Noting the key developments since its last meeting in May, the MPC said the real GDP growth for FY25 was provisionally reported at 2.7pc.
“Despite a substantial widening in the trade deficit, the current account remained broadly balanced in April,” it highlighted, also mentioning the increase in the SBP foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion as of June 6, owing to the $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Third, the revised budget estimates indicate the primary balance surplus at 2.2pc of GDP in FY25, up from 0.9pc last year,” the MPC said, adding that the government was targeting a primary surplus of 2.4pc of the GDP for next year.
The SBP decision also comes on the heels of Pakistan’s contractionary budget, in which it cut total spending by 7pc and set a GDP target of 4.2pc for fiscal year 2025-26.
The government said the $350 billion economy is stabilising under a $7bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, though analysts remain wary of external and fiscal pressures.</p><small>2025-06-16 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1616304876a66a9.jpg?r=163342' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917486/china-posts-fastest-growth-in-nuclear-arsenal-to-600-warheads-report' target='_blank'><strong>China posts fastest growth in nuclear arsenal to 600 warheads: report</strong></a><br><p>China’s nuclear arsenal has grown faster than that of any other country, reaching an estimated 600 warheads by early 2025, adding momentum to the global arms race and raising strategic concerns, an international security think tank said on Monday.
The country’s nuclear stockpile has been expanding by roughly 100 warheads per year since 2023, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in its Sipri Yearbook 2025, warning that a new and dangerous nuclear arms race is taking shape amid a widespread weakening of arms control frameworks.
According to the report, by January this year, China built or nearly completed around 350 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos and could have at least as many ICBMs as either Russia or the United States by the turn of the decade.
The report, however, said that even if China reaches 1,500 warheads by 2035, this would still represent only about a third of each of the current Russian and US stockpiles.
Beijing said it follows a nuclear strategy that “focuses on self-defence”.
“China … always keeps its nuclear capabilities at minimum level as required by national security and never engages in arms race,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a news conference in Beijing.
He said Beijing “follows a policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances and has committed not to use nuclear against non-nuclear states”.
China is the “only nuclear state to adopt such a policy”, he said, adding that Beijing “will stay firmly committed to safeguarding its own legitimate security interests and keeping the world peaceful and stable”.
Nuclear capabilities expand
The report revealed that nearly all nine nuclear-armed states — the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — continued to modernise and expand their nuclear capabilities in 2024.
The overall global nuclear inventory declined slightly to 12,241, the report said, while expressing concern that a “dangerous new nuclear arms race is emerging”.
Russia maintains the world’s largest arsenal, at 5,459 warheads, while the US has 5,177 warheads. The two nations account for about 90 per cent of the world’s total, the report said.
Longtime rivals Pakistan and India are believed to have expanded their nuclear programmes in 2024, according to the report.
India is believed to have once again slightly expanded its nuclear arsenal in 2024 and continued to develop new types of nuclear delivery systems. It possesses 180 nuclear warheads compared to 172 last year.
Pakistan also continued to develop new delivery systems and accumulate fissile material in 2024, the report said. It is believed to possess 170 nuclear warheads, the same as in 2024. A brief armed conflict between the two nations in May highlighted the risks of escalation.
Israel has 90 warheads, although the country has not confirmed its nuclear arsenal. It is believed to be modernising its capabilities, and conducted a test of a missile propulsion system in 2024, and appears to be upgrading its plutonium production reactor site at Dimona.
North Korea was estimated to possess around 50 nuclear warheads as of January, the same as last year. It possesses enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more nuclear warheads.</p><small>2025-06-16 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/161606329766545.png?r=162835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917494/trump-orders-deportation-drive-targeting-democratic-cities' target='_blank'><strong>Trump orders deportation drive targeting Democratic cities</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump directed federal authorities to ramp up deportation efforts in Democratic-led cities on Sunday, doubling down on a politicised anti-immigration drive after major protests in Los Angeles.
“We must expand efforts to detain and deport illegal aliens in America’s largest cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“These, and other such cities, are the core of the Democrat power centre,” he claimed, citing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories that undocumented immigrants are voting in US elections in significant numbers.
Trump has made deporting undocumented immigrants a key priority for his second term, after successfully campaigning against an alleged “invasion” by criminals.
Raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in Los Angeles have sparked days of mainly peaceful protests, though they have seen sporadic violence at times.
Trump has pounced on the violent incidents to deploy 4,000 National Guards and 700 Marines to the Democrat-led city, against the wishes of local and state authorities.
California has sued to regain control of the National Guardsmen from Trump, arguing he overstepped his authority. That suit is working its way through federal court.
Mayor Karen Bass said on Sunday that an overnight curfew put in place last week to stop vandalism and looting at the protests would be extended by “a couple more days.”
She described the fear and anger that have taken hold in the heavily Latino city over the immigration raids.
“People are afraid to leave their homes,” she said, adding that raids have at times felt “indiscriminate.”
“This is the United States. You are not supposed to have to show your papers if you go out in public,” she said.
Los Angeles was mostly calm on Sunday with just a handful of demonstrators marching outside City Hall ahead of the curfew.
“Get the job done!”
In a long screed on Truth Social on Sunday, Republican Trump charged that ICE agents “are subjected to violence, harassment, and even threats from radical Democrat politicians”.
But, he insisted, “nothing will stop us from executing our mission […] ICE officers are herewith ordered […] to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest mass deportation programme in history.”
Trump made a litany of grievances against “sick” Democrats, including charges that they “believe in open borders, transgender for everybody, and men playing in women’s sports”.
That, he said, was why he wanted ICE and other law enforcement agencies “to focus on our crime-ridden and deadly inner cities”.
He said he had directed his entire administration “to put every resource possible behind this effort, and reverse the tide of mass destruction migration that has turned once idyllic towns into scenes of third world dystopia”.
Trump said he wanted “our brave officers to know that real Americans are cheering you on every day”.
“To ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, the patriots at Pentagon and the State Department, you have my unwavering support. Now go, get the job done!” he wrote.
Former president Barack Obama, meanwhile, criticised Trump’s deportation drive.
“Families with similar backgrounds who just want to live, work, and support their communities, are being demonised and treated as enemies,” he said on the social media platform X.
“We can fix our broken immigration system while still recognising our common humanity and treating each other with dignity and respect.”

According to a Finance Division statement, the committee chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb conducted a detailed assessment of the global and domestic petroleum market situation and noted that there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.
Nonetheless, the committee’s members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.
To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.
The petroleum division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee’s mandate, the statement added.
The prime minister had formed the committee to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Besides the finance minister, it also includes senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts.
The Finance Division said the formation of this committee reflects the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.
The committee has been entrusted to closely monitor the price of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region.
It will determine forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term, suggest a plan, if required, to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied, and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact in the event of a protracted conflict.
The statement said the government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time.
Global oil prices were volatile on Monday, after surging seven per cent on Friday, as renewed strikes by Israel and Iran over the weekend increased concerns that the battle could widen across the region and significantly disrupt oil exports from the Middle East, Reuters reported.
Brent crude futures were up 6 cents, or 0.08pc, to $74.29 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 21 cents or 0.29pc, to $73.19.

The incident comes days after an Air India flight to London, using the same type of Boeing aircraft, crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad moments after take-off, killing 241 of the 242 people on board.
The Dreamliner aircraft flying Air India flight AI315 out of Hong Kong on Monday is now undergoing checks, said the source.
AI315 made a return to Hong Kong International Airport and requested local standby at around 1pm, then “landed safely at around 1:15pm”, the spokesperson of Airport Authority Hong Kong said.
The airport operations were not affected, the spokesperson added.
Flight AI315 took off from Hong Kong at around 12:20pm and landed just around an hour later.
It reached an altitude of 22,000 feet and then started descending, according to flight tracking website AirNav Radar. The plane was seven years old.
Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Hong Kong-New Delhi flight.

Tehran has hit back with strikes against Israel since it unleashed waves of attacks against Iran on Friday, sparking global alarm that the conflict could erupt into a regional war.
New Delhi, which has relations with both countries, has sought to relocate its citizens within Iran after Tehran closed its airspace.
“The Indian Embassy in Tehran is continuously monitoring the security situation and engaging Indian students in Iran to ensure their safety,” a foreign ministry statement said.
“In some cases, students are being relocated with [the] Embassy’s facilitation to safer places within Iran,” the ministry added.
 






There are around 10,000 Indian citizens in Iran, according to government data last year, while figures from 2022 listed more than 2,000 students in Iran.
New Delhi on Friday said it stood ready “to extend all possible support” to both countries, as it urged them to “avoid any escalatory steps”.
 
 

“Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised,” said foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal.
Iran’s health ministry has reported at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israeli authorities have tallied more than a dozen deaths since Tehran began its retaliatory attacks Friday.</p><small>2025-06-16 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/161225158341e81.jpg?r=122610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917345/fc-soldier-cop-martyred-in-waziristan-orakzai-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>FC soldier, cop martyred in Waziristan, Orakzai attacks</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN/KOHAT: A Frontier Corps (FC) soldier was martyred in a targeted gun attack in Ladha tehsil of Upper South Waziristan district on Sunday night.
Ladha assistant commissioner Shadman Safi said the incident occurred when the soldier, Lance Naik Iqbal Khan, was on duty. “Armed men opened fire on him without warning, resulting in his death on the spot. Despite retaliatory fire by the security forces, the attackers managed to escape from the scene,” he added.
Meanwhile, a police official was martyred when terrorists attacked a checkpost in Ghiljo area of Orakzai district on Saturday night.
Sub-divisional police officer Mehboob Khan told Dawn that an unknown number of terrorists surrounded the police post at around 9.40pm and started indiscriminate fire at it, which was duly retaliated by the personnel, and the exchange of fire continued for about an hour.
During the fierce skirmish, a sub-inspector Inayatullah hailing from Kohat district was martyred. The terrorists later fled into the mountains. However, a search operation was launched for the fleeing outlaws.
Mehboob Khan said it could not be ascertained as to from where and how many militants attacked the post.
“The policemen were taken by surprise because it was prayer time.”
It may be recalled that it was the second attack at the same post in a month. The body of the martyred police inspector was taken to a hospital for autopsy.
On Sunday, his funeral prayers were offered at the police lines in Kalaya.

In a post on X on Sunday, Mr Asif said that the FATF had decided against re-listing Pakistan following a meeting of its International Cooperation Review Group a day earlier.
“It is a big victory for Pakistan that despite all the conspiracies of India and Israel, Pakistan has not been included in the grey list,” Mr Asif wrote. He credited the decision to strong support from key allies.
 






“China took a clear stance and supported relief for Pakistan, while Turkey endorsed China’s stance,” Asif said. “Japan also fully supported Pakistan as it is the co-chair of the Asia Pacific Group (APG).”
The FATF, a Paris-based global watchdog that monitors money laundering and terrorism financing, met this week. Its so called ‘grey list’ places countries under increased monitoring until they address identified flaws in their financial systems. Being on the list subjects a country to more intense oversight, which can affect its banking and economic standing with international lenders.
Pakistan was removed from the list in October 2022 after four years of scrutiny.

The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14, despite its timing.
Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade, but some sources speculated that he spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The Pakistani embassy in Washington, however, refused to confirm or deny this claim.
The sources said the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.

PTI supporters protest outside embassy ahead of army chief’s arrival

Meanwhile, several PTI supporters staged a protest outside the Pakistan embassy on Saturday afternoon, calling for the restoration of what they described as “unfettered democracy” in Pakistan.
The demonstration came ahead of the COAS’s arrival. “We believe the army chief is in Washi­ngton, and that’s why we’re here,” said one of the protest organisers, linking the demonstration to the COAS’ presence in the US.
 






The Pakistani embassy declined to confirm or deny the visit at the time of the protest.
The army chief’s trip comes at a particularly delicate time, following Israeli airstrikes in Iran.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, said the visit is complicated by the regional tensions.
“Pakistan wants to cultivate US support but has condemned the Israeli strikes and is working to strengthen ties with Tehran,” Mr Kugelman noted. “For Gen Munir to be in the capital of Israel’s closest ally and Iran’s primary adversary at such a tense moment could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.”
 
 

He added that the unfolding Middle East crisis may also limit how fully US officials can engage with the visiting Pakistani delegation.
Mr Kugelman said counterterrorism cooperation will likely dominate the agenda, and Field Marshal Munir may try to build on recent improvements in bilateral ties following the India-Pakistan ceasefire. However, broader efforts to reframe the security partnership would remain a “hard sell”, he warned.
Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, underscored the strategic imbalance in US regional priorities.
“Washington sees Pakistan in the China camp but as a useful counterterrorism base,” Mr Nawaz said.
“It sees greater trade and markets for its technology and defence materials in India. This makes an unequal situation.”

• Crisis deepens in Balochistan as supply from Iran disrupted
• ME conflict worries global markets
QUETTA/KARACHI: The federal government has jacked up the prices of both petrol and diesel, with their rates climbing by Rs4.80 and Rs7.95 per litre, respectively.
According to a Finance Division notification issued on late Sunday night, the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.
High-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.
Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.
Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by about Re1 and Rs5 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.
Fuel crisis deepens in Balochistan
Meanwhile, the fuel crisis in Balochistan has taken a serious turn amid the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, as the supply of Iranian oil through the border has been badly affected, leading to the closure of a large number of petrol pumps.
The border districts of Balochistan with Iran, including Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk, and Mashkail are worst-affected, as they were not only facing suspension of Iranian oil supply, but also a food shortage, as most eatable supplies also come from Iran.
Around 60 to 70 per cent petrol pumps have been closed due to suspension of supply of Iranian smuggled oil through Makran, Rakhshan and Chagai areas. The petrol pumps selling smuggled Iranian petrol and diesel were already closed by the district administration last week, which also added to citizens’ woes in Quetta and other districts.
 
 

Those involved in the Iranian petrol business had increased prices, selling petrol for Rs280 to 300 per litre in the black market, while the government had fixed the local petrol price at Rs254 per litre.
The petrol supply from Karachi was also affected due to the road blockade between Quetta and the port city at different points.
‘No fuel shortage’
However, the Balochistan government claimed that there was no fuel shortage in the province, as most petrol pumps were open in the provincial capital.
In a statement, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind refuted the impression that the province was facing a fuel shortage.
He said that petrol stations selling Iranian oil are safety hazards, citing 28 fuel-related accidents across Quetta in the past month, including incidents on Airport Road and in Hazar Ganji area.
“These so-called shortages are being exaggerated by those who want to lift the ban on smuggled Iranian fuel,” Rind said, adding that strict action is being taken to ensure the supply of legal petrol through registered pumps. Petrol stations found involved in hoarding or refusing service will face immediate legal consequences, he warned.
Global oil price volatility
The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has raised significant concerns in global markets, particularly in the energy sector, due to both countries’ strategic positions in the Middle East, a region critical to the global oil supply chain.
Investors were on edge ahead of markets reopening late on Sunday, gripped by anxiety over the escalating threat of a sweeping conflict in the Middle East and nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
Oil prices rose by 7pc on Friday, as Israel and Iran traded strikes, and investors will be watching closely to see how prices react when markets open today (Monday).
Israel’s strikes on Iran’s oil and gas industry lifted oil prices and prompted a rush into gold and the dollar, which resumed its role as a safe-haven asset for the first time in months.
Oil prices at close to six-month highs could pose a risk to the inflation outlook, as central banks around the world grapple with the impact on prices from Trump’s trade tariffs and the effect on economic growth.
Energy experts said if hostilities remain limited to tit-for-tat strikes without affecting shipping lanes or oil fields then oil prices may see short-term volatility, but stabilise quickly later.
In other case, if the conflict escalates, impacting the Strait of Hormuz or drags in other countries, the oil prices could surge above $100 per barrel, they feared.

Earlier, on Feb 11, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had formally written to the government and the opposition, seeking nominations for the parliamentary panel.
“The parliamentary committee will be formed once the nominations are received,” he had said during a sitting of the National Assembly.
A spokesperson for the National Assembly said on Sunday that the speaker has so far not received any formal letter from the prime minister about the formation of the parliamentary committee for the appointment of the CEC and two members of the ECP.
“The process will commence only once the letter is officially received”, the spokesman added.
He further said that the premier had already initiated the required consultation with the Leader of the Opposition on May 16, 2025, in accordance with Clause 2A of Article 213 of the Constitution.
“This consultation is aimed at finalising three names each for the posts of Chief Election Commissi­oner and members of the Election Commission from Sindh and Balochistan.”
The spokesperson said that as soon as the consultation process is completed, the speaker will invite nominations from the respective parliamentary leaders in Parliament for the constitution of the said parliamentary committee, as per Clause 2B of Article 213 of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the National Assembly Secretariat respo­nded to a letter written by Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, seeking the formation of a parliamentary panel on the appointment of a new CEC and two ECP members.
The letter, seen by Dawn, draws the attention of the opposition leader to clauses 2A and 2B of Article 213 read with Clause 2B of Article 218 of the Constitution.
Clause 2A of Article 213 reads, “The Prime Minister shall in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, forward three names for appointment of the Commissioner to a Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person”.
Clause 2B reads, “The Parliame­ntary Committee to be constituted by the Speaker shall comprise fifty percent members from the Treasury Benches and fifty percent from the Opposition Parties, based on their strength in Majlis-e-Shoora (Parlia­ment), to be nominated by the respective Parliamentary Leaders.”
However, none of the two clauses appears to restrict formation of a parliamentary committee before the completion of the consultation process.
On June 4, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had written a letter to Mr Khan inviting him for consultation on appointment of CEC and two members of the Commission without specifying any date.
The five-year term of the chief election commissioner and two ECP members had expired on January 26 but under a controversial amendment they will continue to hold their offices till the appointment of their successors.
