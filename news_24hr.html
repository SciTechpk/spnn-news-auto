Westernisation is the import and adoption of European culture, social and political ideas, and technology by non-Western societies. Interestingly, even though the US became perhaps the most active exporter of Westernisation after World War II, its own creation in the late 18th century was an outcome of Westernisation. 
The US’ national and cultural identity were strongly influenced by European philosophy and history. Industrialisation in the US was significantly influenced by Britain, with early American industrial development largely based on British models and technologies.
Non-Western countries embraced Westernisation because it was linked to social, political and economic modernity and ‘progress’. It was closely linked to capitalism and democracy, even though many non-democratic regimes adopted it as well. But, by the late 1970s, critiques against Westernisation in non-Western regions began to find more space than before in the politics and intelligentsias of these regions. Westernisation started to be seen as a tool of ‘cultural imperialism’ and a cause of identity loss and the erosion of ‘traditional ways of life.’
For example, many Muslim-majority countries initiated projects to replace Westernisation’s economic, political and cultural products with ‘Islamic’ products. Ideas such as ‘Islamic constitutions’, ‘Islamic banking’, ‘Islamic science’ etc began being applied in the economic, political and cultural spheres. Such ‘Islamisation’ projects were an overarching response/reaction to Westernisation.

For decades, Pakistan’s political and cultural discourse has been framed as a struggle against ‘Westernisation’. But the real story is more complex — and China’s pragmatic approach to
Westernisation shows that modernisation need not be hostage to ideology or faith

But this did not mean the outright rejection of ‘Western’ technology — as long as it was applied in an ‘Islamic manner.’ Western cultural products too were not rejected, as long as they did not offend ‘Islamic sensibilities.’ The outcome of all this was a complex fusion that produced societies of co-existing contrasts. But in such societies, it actually became almost impossible to reach a convincing consensus on exactly what was ‘Islamic’ and what wasn’t. 
Westernisation in various Muslim countries was systematically demonised, but its ‘modernisation’ aspects prevailed. On the one hand, modernisation was compartmentalised (or only made available to certain sections of the society), and, on the other hand, it was ‘Islamised’ (for the ‘masses’). 
Additionally, ‘postmodernism’ as a collection of political, economic and cultural critiques comprehensively vilified Westernisation — even though postmodernism too was a product of the West. Postmodernism romanticised ‘localism’ and saw the world as an assemblage of islands with their own ‘ways of life.’ 
Yet, postmodernism also celebrated hybridity and the mixing of cultures, which gave credence to what became to be known as ‘globalisation’. This dual and often contradictory nature of postmodernism is present in many Muslim-majority regions. Contradictions can produce a constructive synthesis but, in this case, it mostly produced confusion and identity crises. 
Westernisation is no more a troubling spectre, though. One adopts it as a necessity — even selectively. Many non-Western countries have begun to use Western technologies and economic ideas to further evolve them and call them their own. China is an excellent case in point. 
 


From 1979 onwards, the Chinese adopted Western economic and cultural ideas and technologies by first fully understanding them and then tweaking them in an entirely pragmatic manner (instead of on the basis of an ideology or faith). There might be a Chinese system of banking, for example, but it’s not called Confucius or Maoist banking. 
Anyone talking disparagingly about Westernisation in Pakistan vis-a-vis Islam is only deepening the confusion. If they are willing to look beyond this, they will notice that, from the 1980s onwards, the more alarming issue has been that of ‘Indianisation’. And this is due to how ‘Islamisation’ was concocted to supposedly stall Westernisation. Let me explain. 
‘Islamisation’ projects not only produced a complex (and confusing) duality, they also triggered sectarian and ethnic polarisation, especially in multi-ethnic/multi-sectarian regions such as Pakistan. The country’s polity contains multiple ideas of ‘true Islam.’ State-backed ‘Islamisation’ projects created tensions because these may not be acceptable to certain sects and sub-sects and even to certain ethnic groups. This triggers tensions that weaken Pakistani nationalism and identity. 
Indian cultural products such as Bollywood films, though first banned in Pakistan in 1965, were unofficially allowed to be watched at home on VCRs in the 1980s — ironically during a dictatorship that was busy constructing an ‘Islamisation’ project in the country. The dictatorship did this to push so-called ‘un-Islamic’/‘Western’ behaviour indoors (such as watching films, holding ‘dance parties’, drinking alcohol etc), as the dictatorship got busy ‘Islamising’ the outdoors.
Years later, those bothered by the resultant contradictory duality began to see India as some magical place of democracy, secularism, freedom and, of course, great films. As the ‘Islamised’ outdoors became a mere aesthetic exercise to appease anti-Westernisation crusaders, Indianisation began working as a middle path between Westernisation and ‘Islamisation’ for an increasing number of Pakistanis. 
Intellectuals, advertising executives, commercial brands, artists and everyday folk began revering Indian cultural, academic and political content because Pakistan’s own content in this regard continued to be weighed down by ‘Islamisation’. However, eventually, India itself began to roll back its revered democracy and secularism, bringing exclusivist ideologies such as Hindutva to the surface. Also, India’s cultural products began taking a more crass, anti-Pakistan turn.
The consequential retreat of Indianisation in Pakistan has been painfully slow. But it is receding. However, its influence on anti-state ethnic and Islamist groups (both militant and political) has grown. They see India as their vessel through which they will achieve their goals. 
To neutralise Indianisation, which has now taken a more sinister turn, Pakistan needs to engage with Westernisation as China has. It has to be a pragmatic engagement, based on economic and political requirements. The engagement needs to be free of any ideology or faith, though.

While many participants expressed concern over a looming security vacuum and its likely spillover into Pakistan, a few struck a markedly optimistic tone. Among them was a retired senior military official who declared confidently: “The good days are returning. The Delhi-leaning set-up in Kabul is on its way out. With the Taliban back in charge, all Islamabad needs to do is press for the closure of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan [TTP] and Baloch separatist sanctuaries in eastern Afghanistan, and the Taliban will comply. They owe us.”
He was not alone. Across Pakistan’s political and security establishment, the Taliban’s return in August 2021 was initially greeted with a cautious but clear sense of opportunity. A friendly regime in Kabul appeared to serve Islamabad’s long-standing strategic goals: rolling back Indian influence, reducing Western presence and restoring Pakistan’s central role in shaping regional outcomes.
Then-prime minister Imran Khan hailed the moment as the breaking of “the shackles of slavery.” Then-interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, speaking triumphantly at the Torkham border crossing, predicted the rise of “a new bloc” that would elevate the region’s global significance. Even Khawaja Muhammad Asif, then in opposition and now defence minister, posted a photograph of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar alongside US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, captioned: “You may have the power, but God is with us. Allah-o-Akbar.”

Four years on from the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the optimism surrounding what was being hailed as a geopolitical victory for Pakistan has vanished. Instead, Pakistan is contending with a rising wave of militant violence from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan, and which threatens to expand inland. What options does Islamabad have to rethink its Afghan strategy?

Four years later, that optimism has all but vanished. As Afghanistan slips from international headlines, Pakistan faces mounting costs from what was once hailed as a strategic win. Instead of securing its western frontier, Islamabad confronts a resurgence of militant violence, a worsening security climate and a strained relationship with a regime it once considered an ally.
Drawing on recent fieldwork in both countries, this article examines how the Taliban’s return has deepened Pakistan’s domestic security crises, exposing the limits of its longstanding strategic assumptions.
ACROSS THE BORDER, VIOLENCE RISES AGAIN
For the political and religious elders of Bajaur, the stakes could not have been higher. With the government poised to launch a new counterterrorism operation in the district bordering Afghanistan against the TTP and the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) — the local affiliate of the transnational Islamic State network — they took it upon themselves to negotiate a peaceful resolution through a jirga.
Their appeal to local TTP commanders was straightforward: either retreat into Afghanistan or relocate to remote mountainous areas to engage security forces. Such a move, they argued, would spare civilian populations from the destruction, displacement and the fear that inevitably follow armed conflict in villages.
Yet the militants, sensing a shift in regional power dynamics, refused.
Emboldened by the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan, the TTP leaders, according to a participant in the jirga, demanded terms that Pakistan could never accept. The talks collapsed, making renewed conflict all but inevitable. The renewed military operation was launched on August 11.
The Taliban’s triumph in Kabul has emboldened militant groups across Pakistan’s western belt. Alongside the TTP, groups such as the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Baloch ethno-separatist organisations such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have exploited the shifting regional balance to intensify their insurgencies against the Pakistani state.
ISKP — previously weakened by crackdowns by the US, the former Afghan government, and the Taliban — has also been reinvigorated since the Taliban’s takeover. After facing sustained pressure from the Taliban inside Afghanistan, some ISKP fighters crossed into Pakistan, particularly into Bajaur, where the group has since carried out several high-profile attacks.
The release of this year’s Global Terrorism Index (GTI) by the Institute for Economics and Peace think-tank coincided with an attempted hijacking of the Jaffer Express passenger train in Balochistan by BLA militants in March, an incident that drew international attention.
According to the GTI, Pakistan is now ranked as the world’s second most terrorism-affected country, after Burkina Faso, a name unfamiliar to many Pakistanis. The report also highlighted a troubling reality: three Pakistani militant groups, the TTP, the BLA and the ISKP, are among the world’s 10 deadliest terrorist organisations, posing a formidable challenge to Pakistan’s counterterrorism strategy.
Findings from the GTI, corroborated by statistics from law enforcement agencies and other security research organisations, indicate that Pakistan has witnessed a sharp escalation in terrorism since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. In the years since, the country has faced a renewed wave of attacks, including suicide bombings, targeted assassinations, and complex assaults on military installations, political gatherings and mosques.
RESURGENCE OF MILITANT GROUPS
Until 2020, militant outfits such as the TTP and the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group were under sustained pressure from multiple fronts. Pakistan’s large-scale counterterrorism campaigns, including Operation Zarb-i-Azb launched in 2014, inflicted heavy losses on their ranks. Internal divisions further weakened these groups, while US drone strikes eliminated much of their senior leadership. By that period, many TTP factions had either gone dormant or dispersed into Afghanistan’s eastern provinces, including Khost, Kunar and Nangarhar.
In Balochistan, too, attacks by the BLA and other major separatist organisations had declined, due to a persistent security crackdown and internal splintering.
However, the US-Taliban peace talks in Doha and the subsequent American withdrawal from Afghanistan breathed new life into Pakistani militant groups, particularly the TTP. The anticipation of a Taliban victory triggered a wave of reunifications among previously fragmented TTP factions.
By mid-2020, several key splinters, including those aligned with al-Qaeda, had rejoined under the leadership of TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali. In internal communications, Wali praised the Afghan Taliban’s unity and urged Pakistani jihadist groups to follow suit, reportedly telling his commanders: “The jihad in Pakistan will not succeed until all mujahideen unite under one flag, as our Afghan brothers have done.”
The Taliban’s return to full power in August 2021 was a watershed moment for militant ideologues across the region. For the TTP, it was both an inspiration and a validation of their long-term strategy.
Since then, Pakistan has seen a sharp resurgence in insurgent violence. In 2024, terrorist attacks rose 70 percent from the previous year, reaching 521 incidents. These claimed 852 lives, a 23 percent increase in fatalities, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies. The surge marks the fourth consecutive year of escalating attacks on security forces and related casualties since 2021.
“PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT” IN AFGHANISTAN
The Pakistani military recently claimed it had killed 47 militants in two separate raids, as they attempted to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Balochistan’s Zhob district, one of the deadliest cross-border clashes in recent months. While the military provided few details, it identified the militants as belonging to Fitna al-Khwarij, a term coined by the military leadership for the TTP and other Islamist militant groups.
“While the US may have ended its presence, it left behind an unstable Afghanistan, making it a sanctuary for regional militant groups,” a senior security official in Islamabad tells me. “Whether it is ideological confidence, access to abandoned US weaponry, or physical sanctuaries, these groups are receiving active support or passive facilitation from the Taliban administration in Kabul.”
A recent report by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team echoed these concerns. It noted that the TTP, operating in a “permissive environment” in Afghanistan, now fields around 6,000 fighters and has acquired advanced weaponry, significantly enhancing its operational capabilities with substantial logistical and tactical support from the de facto Afghan authorities.
Muhammad Feyyaz, a Lahore-based academic specialising in terrorism studies, describes the Taliban’s return as “costly” for Pakistan. “Before the takeover, Pakistan faced no existential threat from Afghanistan. Now, Taliban-ruled Afghanistan poses exactly that,” he says. He said that the Taliban administration is actively backing the TTP’s efforts to regain Pakistan’s tribal belt as part of a larger vision for a transnational Islamic emirate.
While Pakistan’s military demonstrated during Operation Zarb-i-Azb that it could inflict severe damage on militant networks, the security environment of today is fundamentally different, more fragmented, more complex, and far less conducive to decisive action. The political, security, and economic realities of post-2021 Pakistan are inextricably linked to the dramatic shifts in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s return to power.
Pakistan has not been able to mount an effective counterterrorism response against TTP, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction and other groups due to the US exit from Afghanistan, fractured relations with the Taliban, divergent postures on the TTP and the growing state-society gap in the areas along with Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions, according to Abdul Basit, an expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

POLITICAL CHAOS, FRACTURED CONSENSUS
In recent weeks, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been navigating turbulent political waters. Meeting with jirga leaders from the former tribal districts, he encountered a unified stance against any new military operation and the mass displacement it could trigger. Tribal elders instead proposed a broad-based, empowered jirga, including federal and provincial representatives, elders and key stakeholders, to open dialogue directly with the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Gandapur also faces resistance from within his own party. From jail, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan has warned against authorising military action in KP, particularly in the merged tribal districts. The party’s stance is explicit: no renewed operations on home soil.
This is a sharp contrast to 2014, when the Karachi airport attack and the Army Public School (APS) massacre forged an unprecedented national consensus behind Operation Zarb-i-Azb. Political parties, civil society and the media stood united.
Today, however, major political parties, including PTI, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) and the Awami National Party (ANP), openly oppose a new offensive, warning of mass displacement and social disruption. Grassroots peace campaigns in KP are already rallying public resistance, underscoring that, without political consensus, the state’s ability to act decisively will remain limited. Since 2008, residents have endured multiple operations under different names, yet neither peace has returned nor terrorism has been eradicated, local activists complain.
CROSS-BORDER SANCTUARIES
A decade ago, the TTP was weakened by internal divisions, defections to the ISKP and the loss of senior leaders to US drone strikes. Today, the picture is starkly different. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August 2021, the TTP has consolidated its splinter factions, absorbing smaller outfits linked to al-Qaeda and sectarian militancy.
“They’ve now dispersed across Pakistan, while securing hideouts in Afghanistan,” a senior Peshawar-based law enforcement official says. “The Taliban regime not only shelters them but also arms them with modern weapons and night-vision gear abandoned by US forces.” This level of support marks a significant shift from the previous Afghan government of Ashraf Ghani, which had at times cooperated with Islamabad to capture senior TTP leaders, such as Maulvi Faqir Muhammad of Bajaur.
The Taliban administration’s release of hundreds of imprisoned TTP fighters from Afghan jails has revitalised the insurgency, allowing the group to regroup, rearm and conduct operations with heightened sophistication, according to officials.
Adding to the complexity is the emergence of a new jihadist alliance, Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), comprised of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction, Lashkar-i-Islam, and Inqilab-i-Islami Pakistan. Since its formation, the IMP has conducted numerous attacks against Pakistani police and armed forces, primarily in southern KP. The alliance has also expressed its intention to expand operations into other provinces, including Punjab.
The overall conflict has also seen a growing use of drones by both militant groups and state security forces, tactics that have, tragically, increased civilian casualties, including children.
ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS, REDUCED US SUPPORT
Pakistan now confronts the challenge of counterterrorism in an environment devoid of the robust external support it enjoyed a decade ago. In 2014, political stability, relative economic health, and American assistance, including funding, intelligence sharing, and targeted drone strikes, played a decisive role in degrading TTP capabilities.
Today, the economic situation is far bleaker. Mounting debt and fiscal instability have left fewer resources for intelligence gathering, advanced technology procurement, and the deployment of specialised manpower, all crucial to effective counterterrorism operations.
According to Basit, “The US exit from Afghanistan, which had provided intelligence and financial assistance while also restricting TTP and other groups’ movements into Afghanistan, altered regional dynamics.”
There are signs of renewed, albeit limited, US cooperation. Washington recently acknowledged Pakistan’s role in capturing a regional ISKP leader linked to the 2021 Kabul airport attack that killed American troops. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir’s two visits within just one and a half months to Washington underscore Islamabad’s efforts to re-engage with the US security establishment.
On August 11, the U.S. administration designated the BLA and its suicide bomber unit, the Majeed Brigade, as foreign terrorist organizations.
However, Basit warns that it will be nowhere near the coordination we witnessed during the war on terror or the pre-2021 era.
“During that time, it was a US-led, Pakistan-assisted counterterrorism template. Now it is a Pakistan-led, US-enabled counterterrorism equation, where Washington will provide technical support, training and intelligence assistance, and some specialised counterterrorism equipment,” he adds. “But, there will be no funding made available to Pakistan.”
He says that counterterrorism is no more a top priority for the US; it is a tactical concern, and the Munir-Trump bromance will unlock limited, tactical and transactional cooperation on counterterrorism.
BETWEEN BROTHERHOOD AND BLOWBACK
“It’s easy for Pakistan to demand the expulsion of muhajireen from Afghanistan,” says Qari Jamaluddin, a mid-ranking official in the Taliban administration, using the term to refer to Pakistani militants who sought refuge in Afghanistan after Pakistan launched Operation Zarb-i-Azb in 2014. “But such demands do not align with the jihadist worldview, nor with the principles of Islamic or Pashtun brotherhood.”
We met in Kabul on a cold evening in late 2023. I had first known Jamaluddin during his Karachi days. A staunch loyalist of the Taliban’s first regime, his family fled to Pakistan following the 2001 US invasion. In exile, he attended a madressah [religious school] and ran a cloth shop, but his conviction in the Taliban’s eventual return never faltered. “It was only a matter of time,” he would often say.
Shortly after Kabul fell in August 2021, Islamabad pressed the Taliban leadership to stop the TTP from launching attacks inside Pakistan. The effort failed. Instead, the Taliban urged Islamabad to address the TTP’s so-called “grievances” and offered to mediate peace talks, a proposal that exposed the depth of their reluctance to act against former battlefield allies. Talks began but quickly collapsed, leading to renewed violence.
Officially, the Taliban administration denies harbouring foreign militants and frames Pakistani concerns as internal political matters. Yet their counterterrorism policy remains selective: while actively targeting the ISKP, they tolerate the TTP. The Taliban refrain from labelling the TTP as terrorists, viewing them instead as ideological kin and historical comrades-in-arms.
Jamaluddin characterises Islamabad’s support for the Taliban as strictly transactional. “Pakistan backed us to counter Indian influence but, at the same time, it handed over our leaders to the Americans. We endured it because every insurgency needs sanctuaries in a neighbouring country.”
In Pakistan, the Taliban once found an enabling ecosystem across segments of society that allowed them to reorganise and mount a lethal insurgency from around 2003 onward. Without that support, Jamaluddin acknowledges, the Taliban’s rise to power would have been far more difficult.
“It was not the Pakistani state, but the TTP, Pakistani religious activists and madressah teachers that stood unwaveringly with the Taliban,” he says. “They fought and died for us while being hunted by US drones in North Waziristan.”
Many Taliban leaders and experts argue that the reluctance to confront the TTP runs deeper than politics. “The relationship between the Taliban and the TTP is built upon shared ideological, historical, and cultural bonds,” says Jabbar Durrani, an Afghan researcher based in Britain. “This connection extends beyond the top leadership to include their rank-and-file members, who often maintain close personal and operational ties.”
Former-Afghan refugee minister Khalilur Rehman Haqqani, later assassinated in an ISKP attack in December 2024, recounted in a 2023 TV interview how TTP founder Baitullah Mehsud once captured dozens of Pakistani security personnel to secure the release of Taliban prisoners, including Haqqani himself. For many Taliban leaders, such episodes are enduring reminders of shared sacrifice.
This history reinforces the perception among the Taliban’s ranks in Afghanistan that cutting ties with the TTP would be both ungrateful and dangerous. “Any heavy-handed move against the TTP,” warns Durrani, “could trigger internal dissent and drive their fighters into the arms of ISKP, already locked in a bitter conflict with the Afghan Taliban.”

PAKISTAN’S RESPONSE
Frustrated by a surge in terrorist attacks, Pakistan has adopted a mix of hard and soft power tactics to pressure the Taliban administration in Kabul into acting against the TTP.
Since 2022, the Pakistani military has carried out at least three airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, the most significant occurring in December 2024, when jets targeted suspected Pakistani militant hideouts in Paktika province.
In parallel, Islamabad has sought to exert economic and demographic pressure. Since September 2023, it has expelled over one million undocumented Afghans, imposed a strict visa regime at the previously open Chaman border crossing, and tightened Afghan transit trade. These measures, which drew condemnation from UN agencies and human rights organisations, have disrupted bilateral trade and restricted Afghanistan’s access to essential imports.
While Pakistan’s Interior Ministry defended the expulsions as a “sovereign right to regulate illegal foreign nationals”, the timing suggested a calculated move to increase pressure on Kabul.
IS PAKISTAN’S AFGHAN POLICY A FAILURE?
“Whether it was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 or the US-led intervention in 2001, Pakistan could not remain neutral,” a senior military official remarks when asked if the country’s Afghan policy has failed, as many critics contend. “Our geographic location has never afforded us the luxury of detachment. Proximity to conflict zones involving global powers has historically required us to take sides, always to safeguard national interests,” he adds.
Pakistan’s longstanding policy toward Afghanistan has been a subject of intense debate, often viewed by critics as a series of miscalculations. Yet, officials in Islamabad defend their approach as a necessary response to a complex geopolitical landscape, driven by the country’s unique geographic position. The Taliban’s refusal to act against anti-Pakistan militants now exposes the limits of Islamabad’s longstanding reliance on non-state actors.
From arming the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union in the 1980s to supporting the Taliban’s rise in 1996, and even after its ouster in 2001, Pakistan has often viewed Afghanistan less as a sovereign neighbour and more as “strategic depth.” Critics contend this policy has produced severe blowback, fuelling militancy, straining border relations and deepening Pakistan’s diplomatic isolation.
Today, after four years of the Taliban’s rule, Pakistan is attempting a delicate balancing act. While it extended swift recognition to the Taliban regime in 1996, its response to the Taliban’s return in August 2021 has been far more cautious. Islamabad has not formally recognised the new government but has granted it de facto recognition, allowing ambassadorial work to continue. This measured approach reflects lessons learned from the international censure that followed its early recognition in the 1990s.
Islamabad is now advocating for an “inclusive” political settlement in Afghanistan, a position it shares with other regional powers such as China, Russia and Iran. This stance, which emphasises incorporating diverse ethnic and political factions, marks a strategic shift away from an over-reliance on any single group, such as the Taliban, and highlights Pakistan’s effort to align its policy with international consensus.
The future of Pakistan’s Afghan policy hinges on whether this new approach can navigate the intricate dynamics of internal security, regional rivalries and the push for international legitimacy.
A TASTE OF RESOLVE
The resurgence of militant groups such as the TTP and Baloch separatists has emerged as Pakistan’s most pressing security challenge in years. The threat is no longer confined to the country’s peripheries, but is steadily encroaching inland.
In Punjab’s Bhakkar district, authorities have warned government employees to avoid neighbouring areas of KP, amid credible kidnapping threats. In Balochistan, the suspension of internet services until August 31 underscores the severity of the separatist threat and the daily disruption it inflicts on residents.
Four years of the Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan have not led to regional stability but have instead fuelled a complex web of security, political and economic challenges for Pakistan. A stark and uncomfortable comparison arises: while the Taliban, with limited resources, has managed to maintain internal control and weaken ISKP, Pakistan, despite its vast and sophisticated security infrastructure, continues to struggle with resurgent militancy.
This disparity compels an honest and critical reassessment of Pakistan’s security doctrine. The question is whether the tools and strategies that served Pakistan for decades are still effective against a fundamentally changed, more fragmented and more complex threat.
With violence escalating in KP, Islamabad may soon be forced to abandon limited, intelligence-led crackdowns in favour of sustained, large-scale military campaigns. For many, ongoing peace talks between local jirgas and the TTP serve a dual purpose: proving that all peaceful avenues have been exhausted and building public support for stronger action.
Yet, success will not be measured by force alone. Rebuilding public trust, demonstrating decisive gains and avoiding the cycles of the past will be critical. The path Pakistan chooses in the coming months will not only determine the fate of this insurgent wave. It will shape the country’s security trajectory for years to come.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia expressed “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the government and people of Pakistan over the loss of lives from floods and torrential rains.
In a statement on Saturday, the ministry said the Kingdom stood “in full solidarity” with Pakistan during this “tragic natural disaster” and extended support to the families of the victims, along with best wishes for the swift recovery of those injured.
 






The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also conveyed “deep sorrow” over the loss of life, offering condolences to the government and people of Pakistan. Turkiye reaffirmed its solidarity with Pakistan and extended sympathies to bereaved families.
 






Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a message to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, announced Iran’s readiness to assist in flood relief efforts.
He expressed support for Pakistan and offered humanitarian assistance to ease the suffering of those affected, also wishing a swift recovery for the injured.
US chargé d’affaires in Pakistan, Natalie Baker, extended condolences to the affected families. “My team and I stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan during this difficult time,” she said in a statement.
 






Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a condolence letter to President Asif Ali Zardari, expressing grief over the loss of lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He conveyed heartfelt sympathy to the families of the deceased and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.

Guan Jing

GILGIT: The body of Chinese mountaineer Guan Jing, who died on Aug 12 after being hit by falling rocks while descending from the K2 peak, has been recovered and brought to the mortuary in Skardu.
The incident occurred on the Abruzzi Spur route between Camp-I and the Advanced Base Camp — a section notorious for frequent rockfalls. Guan had successfully reached the summit on Aug 11 with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.
According to Karrar Haidri, senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the Chinese climber died of a head injury caused by falling rocks. The evacuation was carried out by Army Aviation, which transported the body by helicopter from Concordia.
Earlier, a team of mountaineers had attempted the recovery on foot after poor weather had grounded helicopter operations. Guan Jing died on Aug 12, a day after summiting K2 with her group in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Her body was later found 100-150 metres above the Advanced Base Camp, at an altitude of around 5,400 metres. At 8,611 meters, K2 is considered one of the world’s most dangerous and technically challenging mountains, with a fatality rate far higher than that of Mount Everest.
Mr Haidri extended his deepest condolences to Guan Jing’s family, friends and the international mountaineering community, calling her loss “deeply tragic”.

Addressing a jirga at Gopalum Khall here on Saturday, leaders from various political parties, including ANP, JI and PPP, said both militants and the military should stay away from their area, adding that residents would not migrate under any circumstances.
Addressing the jirga, elders including ANP Lower Dir general secretary Malik Muhammad Zaib Khan, Malik Aftab Khan, JI’s Malik Faramosh Khan, PPP’s Talimand Syed, Inayat, Habibur Rehman, Malik Alam Zaib, Malik Hayat Khan, Malik Zahir Khaliq and others recalled that during 2008-09, the people of Khall had resisted militants’ entry, as a result the region remained peaceful.
The elders said ensuring peace was the responsibility of the state, but its reluctance to take decisive action against a handful of militants had raised doubts.

They warned the government not to shed Pashtun blood for “foreign interests” and demanded the return of weapons earlier taken from local tribes, so they could defend themselves.
The jirga participants pledged cooperation with police in maintaining order but said if the situation worsened, they would call in the army.
FAREWELL PARTY: A farewell ceremony was held at the Dir Scouts Fort in Balambat for outgoing commandant Brigadier Sanaullah.
Political leaders from Upper and Lower Dir, peace jirga members, and the newly-appointed commandant Colonel Arsalan attended the party.
Speaking on the occasion, the tribal and political elders lauded Brigadier Sanaullah’s efforts for peace and extended him the best wishes.
In his address, the outgoing commandant said the support of local elders had been crucial in maintaining stability in both the districts.
He said during his two-year tenure he worked to strengthen coordination between the public and security forces, ensuring unity against anti-state elements.
Brigadier Sanaullah noted that several disputes were resolved through jirgas to promote harmony, adding that the people of Dir were patriotic, brave and had always supported the forces in difficult times.
He urged the political and community elders to remain united for peace, development and prosperity and to extend full support to state institutions against militants.

Roads and bridges were swept away, thousands — including tourists — remained stranded at multiple locations, and electricity, mobile, and internet communication were disrupted in the region.
Cloudburst-triggered flash floods hit multiple areas, adding to the misery of local communities.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), a nine-year-old boy, Zulqarnain Haider, tragically lost his life in a landslide while returning from the summer pasture to his village, Hanochal in Haramosh Valley of Gilgit, on Saturday.
Addressing a press briefing, GB Home Minister Shams Lone said that the Baltistan Highway bridge had been swept away, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for a second consecutive day.

Since Friday, at least 35 people have lost their lives, many more have been injured, and four people remain missing. “So far, 318 houses have been completely destroyed, and 674 have been partially damaged,” Lone said, adding that the GB government lacked the resources to cope with the massive devastation. However, he noted that army troops were conducting relief operations.
 
 

A portion of the Naltar Highway was swept away, leaving a large number of tourists stranded. The flash floods in Naltar also damaged three hydropower generation stations, suspending electricity supply to Gilgit. Residents are also facing a shortage of drinking water.
In Datuchi, Bagrot Valley, a bridge and nearly half a dozen houses were damaged, while in Ghanche district, flash floods destroyed three key bridges, cutting off several villages. Dozens of houses were damaged, and 67 families in Haldi village were shifted to tents.
River erosion in the Guru Jaglot area of Gilgit damaged several homes, with floodwaters entering many houses. In Haton village, flash floods destroyed three homes, private infrastructure, crops, and agricultural land. Thousands of residents in Ghizer district also remained cut off from other areas.
The Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gulmit has remained closed for several days, disconnecting residents of Gojal and severing the Pakistan-China road link.
NDMA issues alert
Meanwhile, the National Disaster Ma­­nag­ement Authority (NDMA) has issued an alert warning of possible glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), heavy rain, and landslides in the northern areas until September 7.
The NDMA also advised tourists to avoid travelling to affected regions and not to cross rivers or streams.
GB has been experiencing an unusual heatwave since June, resulting in unprecedented glacier melting. Temperatures have risen by 48pc above normal, which has been the main cause of the recent disaster.

Speaking to Dawn before leaving for Buner, activists of welfare organisations said that the people in their neighbouring district were in dire need of foodstuff and drinking water after flash floods swept away their houses and crops and badly damaged road infrastructure.
Al-Khidmat Foundation, Swabi, president Wajid Ali Shah said that they had sent medicines worth Rs1 million along with five doctors and 15 paramedical staff to Buner.
“Similarly, on our request five trucks containing dry foodstuffs have reached Buner from our Rawalpindi wing and 15 ambulances of medicines and paramedical staff have also commenced their duty in the affected areas,” Mr Ali said.
“We have also planned to dispatch more foodstuff, tents and medicines to Buner by Saturday evening,” he said. “Right now, we are focused on three areas, including medicines, foodstuffs and tents. These things are badly required in Buner.”
Similarly, Bahrul Amin, president of Sitara Welfare Organisation, Maneri Bala, said that they have collected sugar, rice, drinking water, and about Rs0.2 million cash, which would be distributed among the affected people.
“We have just informed our United Arabs Emirates wing, which will soon send donations. Another team would be dispatched soon to Buner,” he said. “We have decided to go to Pir Baba area, which is worst-hit by the calamity.”
In addition, Al-Salfiya Welfare Organisation, Pabini, members said that they had started collecting donations for the flood-hit people of Buner, while concentrating on medicines and foodstuffs.
Ready-made food and rations are needed for the homeless people, they said.
Various other welfare bodies were seen in action to help people of Buner district.

Following reports of possible rise in the water levels of river Sutlej as India could release water into the river, the district administrations of Vehari and Lodhran swung into action. Field staff have been alerted and relief camps are being set up in riverian areas of the districts.
According to an official handout issued on Saturday, Lodhran Deputy Commissioner Dr Lubna Nazir visited flood relief and monitoring camps at Basti Jagear Horan, Zamindara Bund Adam Wahan and Jhoke Janan.
She told the media that the district administration was alert and relief camps had been established at the government school buildings. She said that the population around the camps had been told to immediately shift to the relief camps in case of an emergency.

She said the camps were equipped with necessary medicines and foodstuff. The revenue field staff was deputed to supervise the distribution process if need arose, she added.
She said the Rescue 1122 had ample life-saving equipment, including boats and the district administration had also set up a flood emergency control center. The DC inspected the relief camps and checked the stocks of medicines and other material. She also directed to immediately remove encroachments along the banks of the river.
On the occasion, the district heads of Rescue 1122, irrigation, revenue, health and livestock departments gave a detailed briefing to the DC regarding the arrangements.
In Vehari district, flood relief camps had been set up near village Lakha Suldera. DC Imrana Tauqeer visited the camps along with Vehari Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) revenue Babar Suleman and reviewed the arrangements.
She directed the officials of Rescue 1122, irrigation, health, food and livestock departments to stay alert to deal with any emergency situation.
The ADC also asked the officials to alert the adjacent population and be ready to move to the relief camps along with their cattle in case of an emergency.
He asked the officials of health and livestock departments to ensure that ample stock of medicine were available at the camps. The food department was also directed to ensure adequate stock of edibles was available.

President Trump makes no bones about how he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. In his no-holds barred quest for being acknowledged as a peacemaker, not only did he bring in from the cold the Russian leader who has been a pariah in the eyes of the West, since his invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but also gifted his guest a great optics win.
From the arrival at an airbase near Anchorage where the two landed within minutes of each other and then alighted from their respective planes and walked on their respective red carpet strips to where they converged, it was a carefully choreographed move that seemed more designed by the guest than the host.
As Trump waited for Putin to walk the final few steps he brought his two hands together to applaud the Russian leader and then the two met and smiled before a handshake, patting each other in a gesture of warmth, even affection. It isn’t clear what the US TV networks were saying but the BBC seemed to struggle with the live broadcast.

Till he arrived in Alaska, Putin did not appear prepared to return any part of eastern Ukraine.

The BBC North America correspondent saw the presence of F-35 stealth warplanes on the tarmac as a force projection. A flypast by a B2 stealth bomber and four F-35s was also similarly described (with a mention of how the B2s released their bunker buster bombs against Iranian nuclear sites in June).
But to the unbiased observer, Putin appeared amused rather than being awed or fearful at the spectacle. In all likelihood, he saw it as a salute by the USAF just as the soldiers lined up either side of the red carpet to ‘present arms’ salute with their ceremonial rifles.
Such was the Russian leader’s confidence at being welcomed back into acceptance by reputedly the most powerful nation’s president that he set aside protocol and security considerations to ride in the Trump limousine while his own limousine, flown in from Russia earlier, followed.
Again, bizarrely, one of the people commenting on BBC TV said they weren’t sure if Putin spoke or understood English, while the Russian leader was visibly engaged in a continuous conversation with his host and later told the media he greeted Trump with a ‘Good afternoon, neighbour. Good to see you’ when he met him. In Alaska, only the Bering Strait separates the two.
As the motorcade was pulling away from the airport, Putin smiled and waved to the cameras. The significance of all this is clear from the fact that over the past three years, Putin, who has been indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, has not been received by any Western country. And here the red carpet had been rolled out for him.
After three hours of talks, the two leaders faced the media but did not answer questions. Putin read from a prepared statement where, after talking about the US-Russia history with specific reference to Alaska, he seemed to flatter Trump, saying that he endorsed the latter’s view that the Ukraine war would not have happened if he had been the US president.
Putin said the meeting, and what was agreed in it, will mark the beginning of peace in Ukraine if what he called the ‘root causes’ were addressed. For his part, Trump spoke briefly and started by saying, “There no deal until there is a deal”. He described the meeting as productive where many points were agreed on but “a few” remain.
Before leaving the podium, he also said he would now call the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, European leaders and Nato officials for consultations.
The discussions must have gone well with the late-night White House announcement that the Ukrainian leader is arriving in Washington on Monday and will be received by Trump for talks. The European leaders, too, reacted positively to whatever they were told.
A peace deal will hinge on how far Putin and Zelensky and the latter’s Western European allies are willing to compromise on their ‘no land for peace’ stance. Till he arrived in Alaska, Putin did not appear prepared to return any part of eastern Ukraine his forces have captured. He also wants recognition of his 2014 annexation of Crimea.
For now, the security guarantees for Ukraine that are being discussed exclude any eastward expansion of Nato into Ukraine. Putin will also be averse to Western boots on the ground. It was, inter alia, talk of Nato expansion plans that first spooked Russia because, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow saw Ukraine as a buffer between Western Europe-Nato and itself.
Trump’s word may not amount to much as has been demonstrated by his support to the Gaza ethnic cleansing by Israel in contrast to his earlier reservations, but in this European conflict, he has moved away a shade from his earlier stance that only Ukraine will have to give up land for peace and it will be Europe and not the US which will offer security guarantees to Kiev.
But for Putin to leave the summit meeting beaming tells one how many compromises he has been forced to agree to, including the amount of land he would swap for peace. For now, he has pushed back by several weeks the likelihood of sterner US sanctions and also charmed his way to having Trump listen to his point of view face to face.
Trump can give himself any prize he wants, like our leaders have done, but hundreds of millions around the world will find any accolade he gets legitimate only if he moves from the end to the war in Ukraine to peace in Gaza and gives up his support for the ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of the Palestinians.

This deficit was caused mainly by the two countries’ differing approaches to Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan’s enthusiasm for CPEC and its projection that China could serve as an alternative to the US. Recently, Pakistan has opened new avenues for cooperation by quietly enhancing its counterterrorism support to Washington. The latest CT dialogue held recently in Islamabad was an expression of both sides’ willingness to expand cooperation.
A day before the dialogue, the US State Depart­ment designated the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army’s military wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organisation. The move was notable because only a couple of months earlier, Washington had added the Resistance Front, considered to be an offshoot of the proscribed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, to the same list.
Many observers saw the addition of the Majeed Brigade as a balancing act between India and Pakistan, given that India had hailed the Resistance Front listing as a diplomatic victory and evidence of America’s acknowledgment that the militant group, which India alleges is backed by Pakistan, was involved in the Pahalgam attack.
By sanctioning the Majeed Brigade, which is linked to the Jaffar Express terrorist attack, Wash­­­ington appears to be signalling that both the Resistance Front and Majeed Brigade were designated per its internal procedures rather than as a concession to any side. The parallel drawn between the Pahalgam and Jaffar Express incidents reinforces this perception. It is also worth noting that Pakistan had previously asked for the international designation of Majeed Brigade as a terrorist entity, but the request was not entertained at the time.

Restoration of confidence between the US and Pakistan has not come without a price for the latter.

The US and Pakistan have a long history of CT cooperation, dating back to 2001 when both countries formally engaged in a joint effort against the global threat of terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11. This engagement, however, has always been overshadowed by constraints arising from mutual mistrust and conflicting geopolitical interests. Despite these challenges, the CT dialogue remained intact, except for a few disruptions after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.
Even before the Taliban’s return to power, Pakistan had been struggling to maintain cordial relations with Washington. After August 2021, the trust deficit widened into a deep gulf. Under these circumstances, the CT dialogue faced disillusionment as both sides struggled to identify common interests to sustain cooperation.
With Al Qaeda significantly weakened following the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, American interest declined. For Washington, the TTP was primarily viewed as Pakistan’s internal problem, despite acknowledging in joint statements that it posed a threat. The group seen by both as a genuine global security concern was the Islamic State-Khorasan, which also had implications for US homeland security.
Pakistan concentrated its CT efforts on IS-K and eventually delivered results on that front, helping to restore America’s confidence in bilateral CT cooperation. Not only did the recently retired Centcom chief, Gen Michael Kurilla, praise Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counterterrorism”, but President Donald Trump himself acknowledged Pakistan’s support in handing over an IS-K terrorist to the US.
The progress achieved last year also brought tangible US support for enhancing Pakistan’s investigative and prosecutorial capabilities, developing border security infrastructure and delivering training to more than 300 police officers and front-line responders.
The underlying objective has been to keep the CT dialogue as a continuous and reliable channel of engagement between the two countries.
A comparison of two joint statements, one issued in May 2024 during the Joe Biden administration and the other released last week, clearly illustrates how the CT dialogue has regained its lost momentum. The May 2024 statement was worded cautiously, noting that “Pakistan and the United States recognise that a partnership to counter [IS-K], TTP and other terrorist organisations will advance security in the region and serve as a model of bilateral and regional cooperation to address transnational terrorism threats”.
By contrast, last week’s joint statement not only acknowledged Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism but also expanded the scope of cooperation to include “the threats posed by the Balochistan Liberation Army”, a long-standing demand of Pakistan.
Equally significant, Pakistan has long sought advanced technological support for its CT efforts. The latest statement reflects an agreement to strengthen institutional frameworks, enhance capabilities to respond to security challenges and counter the use of emerging technologies for terrorist purposes. This effectively acknowledges the threat posed by the militant use of drones, and signals that cooperation in this domain is likely to materialise in the coming weeks.
The restoration of confidence between the two countries and the enhancement of CT cooperation have not come without a price for Pakistan. Islamabad has drastically altered its Afghanistan policy, going so far as to treat the ruling Taliban as an adversary. Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit was cancelled on US advice, reportedly due to the Taliban’s growing ties with Russia and their increasing assertiveness.
Second, it has sought to balance its relations with China, operating under the belief that Beijing, as a pragmatic actor, will not view Pakistan’s growing ties with Washington with suspicion. The thinking in Islamabad is that China might welcome such developments, seeing them as an opportunity to elevate Pakistan’s geopolitical and economic stature, which could benefit Beijing at the right time.
However, Afghanistan has re-emerged as a critical factor in Pakistan’s internal security landscape and its ambitions to connect both geopolitically and geo-economically with Central Asia. The concern is that Pakistan’s national security planners often fail to adopt long-term, strategic perspectives, focusing instead on short-term gains. They seem content celebrating India’s current diplomatic and geopolitical discomfort, without anticipating the challenges that may arise once New Delhi absorbs these shocks and recalibrates its approach.

In just two days, torrential downpours and cloudbursts unleashed flash floods across KP, killing more than 300 people. Entire villages have been erased from the map. A provincial rescue helicopter crashed in Mohmand during operations, claiming the lives of five crew members.
In Azad Kashmir, mudslides buried whole families, while in Gilgit-Baltistan glacier-fed torrents destroyed homes, bridges and farmland. Nationwide, the National Disaster Management Authority has reported at least 645 deaths and 905 injured since the start of the season, with KP bearing the brunt. With fresh rains forecast, the full scale of devastation is yet to be counted.
This is not some freak weather event. Pakistan is enduring the second massive flooding crisis in just three years. The 2022 floods, caused by record monsoon rains, submerged one-third of the country, killed 1,700 people and displaced 33m.
Those floods were described as a “climate catastrophe”, drawing global attention to Pakistan’s vulnerability. Today, the scenes from Buner and Ghizer echo that same nightmare — except the destruction is concentrated in the north, where steep terrain turns cloudbursts into deadly torrents. Could this scale of loss have been prevented? Scientists have long warned that climate change is making Pakistan’s monsoons more erratic, cloudbursts more violent, and glacier melt more destructive.
 
 

While no state can stop the rain, much of the tragedy stems from human failure. The Met Department’s Aug 12 advisory did warn of heavy rain in KP, AJK and GB but it was scant on details for preparedness. Then there is the lack of land-use planning and weak enforcement of building restrictions in flood-prone areas. And our disaster response mechanisms leave much to be desired.
With more rain on the way, immediate measures are essential. Relief corridors must be cleared, with the army’s engineering units building temporary bridges and restoring communication lines. Schools and mosques should be converted into evacuation centres, stocked with dry food and medicines. Wireless radios should be distributed where towers are down.
In the longer term, adaptation must be treated as a survival priority, not an afterthought. The state must invest in a national observatory app, providing instant alerts and safety tips. With mobile penetration above 80pc, even simple voice-based or pictorial warnings could save lives. Alongside this, the Met Department must be upgraded with real-time monitoring capacity.
Local governments need to build resilient housing, enforce safe construction zones, and strengthen embankments. Disaster insurance and relocation options for high-risk settlements are also overdue. The floods of 2010, 2022 and now 2025 mark an unbroken chain of escalating disasters. If Pakistan is to break this cycle, adaptation must move from rhetoric to reality. Lives depend on it.

Locals from nearby villages thronged the makeshift funeral ground, set up on flood-flattened cornfields now covered with a thick layer of alluvial deposits left in the deluge’s wake. The bodies were laid in two rows, with some cots carrying two corpses, blood stains still visible on the shrouds. Villagers jostled to get a final glimpse as elders tried to restrain mobile-wielding youths.
Suddenly, the restless calm was broken by a group of wailing women arriving to say goodbye to their relatives. “Stop filming, stop filming,” some among the crowd shouted, while others muttered, “What are the women doing here? They should not be here.”
Jehan Bar, a bulky local elder, addressed the mourners, urging them not to return home after the burial. “Our family members and friends’ bodies are still lying beneath rubble and sand from Qadir Nagar to Daggar, and we should not leave them this way,” he bellowed. “We will continue the search and give them the proper burial they deserve.”
Before the funeral prayers, I met a shell-shocked Mukhtiar Khan standing beside the rows of bodies. Mukhtiar, a resident of Qadir Nagar — a hamlet a few kilometres further upstream of Batai, one of the worst-affected areas — said he had lost 11 family members, including nephews, nieces and a daughter-in-law.
Along with his extended family, 35 people were either dead or missing. “The bodies of seven of my family members are here for their final rites,” he said quietly, adding that it was Allah’s will, and as a Muslim he bowed before whatever the Almighty had fated for him.
 
 

The mourners later resolved the dispute over women’s presence, and after the funeral prayers, the bodies were carried aside to where the women waited, saying their final goodbyes away from the prying male gaze.
We walked along the Batai Kalay road after the prayers until an Al-Khidmat Foundation volunteer offered us a ride across the Pachay stream to Malik Pur, through a detour. From there, it was still an hour-and-a-half walk to reach Beshonai, the worst-hit village in the district.
Driving through Narbatwal and other hamlets, the devastation was everywhere: several feet of mud and debris filled once-bustling shops, snapped power lines and uprooted pylons lay scattered, and people gathered their ruined possessions into piles in front of damaged homes. Wrecked cars were strewn along the roadside.
At the entrance to Malik Pur, police had set up barricades, allowing only pedestrians to proceed as crews cleared the upstream road. The uphill walk along the Kawga stream was filled with locals — volunteers, survivors and onlookers.
Beshonai, once a vibrant village straddling the stream of the same name, now lay buried under massive boulders. Only fragments of houses stood in eerie silence. At three sites, villagers clawed at the rocks with bare hands and whatever tools they could find. “We start digging whenever we smell decomposing bodies,” said Kamran Khan, a resident who had lost several relatives.
By Saturday afternoon — more than 24 hours after the disaster — no government machinery had reached Beshonai. Kamran said from his house on a higher slope he had watched the village disappear in minutes. “It was raining heavily on Friday morning, then suddenly darkness fell, followed by a rumble. Within minutes, the village was gone.”
The village, home to no more than 120 houses, had lost over 80 lives, he said. “Many still do not know if their relatives are dead or alive.”
Anwar Khan, another resident, said at least 12 of his family members were missing. He recalled locals talking about heavy flooding in the stream on Aug 14, 1995, but even the oldest villagers did not remember anything close to Friday’s catastrophe.
Haider Ali, another resident, told Dawn that the people wandering among the boulders and ruins were in shock. “This was a bustling village. People may still be buried beneath our feet. How can anyone be normal here?”
He explained that the floods appeared to have started from Naray Ghar to the north, thundering down the slopes with unstoppable force. Teachers Irshad Ali and Akbar Zada, furious at the official absence, said: “Locals are working on a self-help basis, welfare organisations are helping, but the government is nowhere. They can have dozens of helicopters for military operations but not one for relief.”
Rizwan Bacha, a resident of Pir Baba, said he had spent the previous night searching for bodies along streams and under debris. “We collected 27 bodies of people from Qadir Nagar.”
Pir Baba Bazaar, the district’s busiest commercial centre, was nearly destroyed when the Pachay nullah burst its banks. Shops and markets were filled with several feet of alluvium, destroying all goods. Mobile signals dropped even at the entrance to Pir Baba Road, while only official and rescue vehicles were allowed to pass the police barricade. Walking through the bazaar felt like wading in sludge.
Jamroz Ali, who ran a juice shop there, recalled: “We were having breakfast when the water rushed in. It came too quickly and filled everything with sand and debris.” He and his family had climbed to the roof and remained there for several hours.
Pir Baba Bazaar is named after one of the most revered saints of the region, Syed Ali Tirmizi — lovingly called Pir Baba. His shrine, on the bank of the Pachay nullah, attracts devotees from across Pakistan. On Friday morning, floodwaters entered the mosque adjacent to Pir Baba’s shrine.

• Urges all Pakistanis to extend a helping hand to distressed families
• Condemns Sindh governor’s remarks as ‘attack on democracy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI has decided to postpone its political activities nationwide in the wake of catastrophic flooding and natural disasters across the country’s northern regions and directed its leaders and workers to join relief and rescue operations.
In a statement on Saturday, the PTI Central Media Department expressed “deep grief and heartfelt condolences over the tragic loss of lives” and announced it would stand “in complete solidarity with the bereaved families”.
The move follows recent devastating floods in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“The PTI immediately put on hold all political activities and directed its leaders and workers to wholeheartedly step forward at this critical time to assist their fellow countrymen, ensuring that every possible relief reaches the affected people to help mitigate their sufferings in this trying period,” the statement read.
It also said the recent spell of torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc, “claiming hundreds of precious lives, displacing countless families, and causing widespread devastation”.
The leadership urged members to set aside political engagements and mobilise resources for relief efforts, while appealing to the nation for a helping hand and generous support to share in the suffering of their fellow citizens.
 
 

“In this challenging time, PTI reaffirms its commitment to serving the people and will continue to support all efforts aimed at mitigating the crisis,” the statement concluded. “We pray for the safety and recovery of all affected communities and urge collective action to overcome this calamity”.
Earlier, on Aug 5, the party had called for protest rallies on Aug 14 but later cancelled them. But despite cancellation a number of its workers were arrested.
Reaction over Tessori’s remarks
Separately, PTI has strongly condemned remarks by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, alleging his comments were a “direct attack on democracy” and a grave insult to the people of Karachi.
A PTI spokesperson said Mr Tessori’s recent remarks undermine the democratic process. He cited a comment from the governor, “Go ahead, vote again — what happened the last time?” as evidence.
He said such statements suggest elections are meaningless and that decisions are made by powerful and unelected quarters.
He stated that Tessori also asked people if they wanted the old MQM back, which he called “a clear reference to the return of Altaf Hussain’s style of politics, long associated with violence, fear, and extortion in Karachi”. He alleged the remarks exposed the MQM’s democratic posturing as a facade.
“Tessori’s comments are part of a dangerous attempt to disillusion the public and erode their faith in the power of the vote,” the spokesperson added. “They are being used to justify the blatant rigging witnessed in the 2024 general elections.”

• Punjab PDMA issues ‘red alert’ for multiple districts
• Tarbela Dam is 98pc full; India releases more water
RAWALPINDI/LAHORE: The authorities have been asked to remain on their toes amid a fresh spell of monsoon rains, set to start from today till the 21st, which will cause torrential downpours across the country along with thunder and windstorms.
The new spell coincides with a warning of heavy flooding in Punjab’s rivers due to an increase in water level on the back of the heavy monsoon rains and glacial melt in the northern parts of the country, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where over 200 people had died in a single day due to flash floods.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­ent (PMD) said widespread rain-wind/thu­­ndershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Kash­mir (Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Ra­­walakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Have­­li, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from August 17 to 19 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is ex­­p­e­cted in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Sha­ngla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan from August 17 to 19.
 
 

In Punjab, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy) is expected in Islam­abad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Atto­­ck, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazir­ab­­ad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Au­­g­­ust 17 to 19 with occasional gaps. Scat­tered rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Ba­­­­hawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur, and Rahimyar Khan from August 18 to 20.
In Sindh, rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Mithi, Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Sha­heed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Bad­in, Sajawal, Tando Allayar, Tando Muh­a­mmad Khan, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur from August 17 to 21.
The PMD said the downpour may generate flash floods in local nullahs and streams in different parts of KP, Punjab, and Kashmir from August 17 to 19, while flash floods in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern parts of Baloch­istan from August 18 to 21 are also likely.
Urban centres, including Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Gujranwala, may experience urban flooding from August 17 to 19, it said, adding that several cities in Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad, may experience the same from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps. During the forecast period, landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, and Kashmir.
Punjab floods warning
On the other hand, Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued red alerts for multiple districts and warned about heavy flooding in the coming days due to an increase in water levels in reservoirs and rivers.
The Indus River is swelling to medium levels at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage, while low-level flooding is ongoing at Tar­bela and Taunsa Barrage. Sutlej River is experiencing low-level flooding at Ganda Singh Wala, with a water flow of 68,000 cusecs. Jhelum River is flowing normal at key points and adjoining streams. Chenab River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding persists in Nullah Palkho (Cantonment). Ravi River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding continues in Nullah Basantar.
Tarbela Dam is 98 per cent full while Mangla Dam is 68pc full. India’s water releases, meanwhile, have increased to 50,000 cusecs.
The PDMA urged citizens, especially those living near riverbanks, to immediately move to safer locations, cooperate with the authorities concerned in case of emergency evacuations, and refrain from recreational activities near the rivers during flood conditions.
The PDMA also warned of heavy rainfall in most districts of Punjab, particularly the northern districts facing risks of torrential rains and cloudbursts. The seventh spell of monsoon rains is relatively stronger, with forecasts of severe downpours, it added.

Police moved the body to hospital and started an investigation. He said Mr Husain’s family hailed from Sanghar. As his parents and other family members live in the US, the purpose of his visit from Karachi was being ascertained, the SSP said.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the unnatural death and sought a report from the police chief, with the direction that the investigation be handed over to the best police officer.
Director News and Current Affairs of the channel said they were waiting for police investigations to complete before commenting on the issue.

“Netanyahu is now a problem in himself,” Frederiksen said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten daily, adding that the Israeli government was going “too far”. She also criticised Israel over plans to build a new settlement in the occupied West Bank.
She described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as absolutely appalling and catastrophic.
Frederiksen added that she wa­­nted to consider “political pressure, sanctions, whether against settlers, ministers, or even Israel as a whole”, referring to trade or research sanctions.

Israeli strikes kill 39 more in Gaza City

“We are not ruling anything out in advance. Just as with Russia, we are designing the sanctions to target where we believe they will have the greatest effect,” added Frederiksen, whose country is not among those who  have said they will recognise the Palestinian state.
Israeli fire kills 39 more
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli attacks killed 39 people on Saturday, warning that intensifying strikes on a Gaza City neighbourhood were placing its remaining residents in mortal danger.
 
 

The Israeli forces have killed at least 61,827 people and wounded 155,275 since October 2023.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said conditions in the Zeitun neighbourhood were rapidly deteriorating, with residents having little to no access to food and water amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
Bassal said Israel was carrying out “ethnic cleansing” in Zeitun.
He said about 50,000 people are estimated to be in that area of Gaza City, “the majority of whom are without food or water” and lacking “the basic necessities of life”.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet approved plans to seize Gaza City, one of the most densely populated parts of the territory which has been devastated by more than 22 months of bombardment.

The study titled “Bangladeshi and Pakistani Women in Good Work” warns that women from these communities are disproportionately excluded from meaningful employment due to discrimination, structural inequalities and inflexible workplaces.
The numbers paint a dismal picture. In 2022, almost half of Pakistani and Bangladeshi women in London (48.1pc) were economically inactive, compared to just 15.3pc of men from the same background. Their unemployment rate stood at 16.9pc, which is more than three times higher than men’s 5.5pc. The most alarming is the gender pay gap: Pakistani women in London earn on average 60pc less than men, the widest disparity of any ethnic group.
Calling the findings “shocking”, London’s Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, said: “It is unacceptable that experienced Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are still being passed over for promotions, or feel compelled to change their names to secure interviews. These stories reveal the resilience of these women, but also the urgency of dismantling the barriers that hold them back.”

Greater London Authority study explores causes of high unemployment rate, gender gap

The report draws on interviews with 32 women who spoke about their frustration but also determination.
 
 

One solicitor described the financial hurdles she faced trying to qualify: “Now the LPC [legal practice course] costs £14,000. I was saving really hard to finance it. When I explained my dad’s a taxi driver, they just looked at me blankly. For others it was easy — their parents could just pay,” said one account who identified herself as Khadeja, a British Pakistani who is 30-35 years old.
Others spoke of being overlooked at work despite clear capability. “Last year, there was a position that came up… They didn’t give it to my colleague, who had over 10 years of experience. Instead, they gave it to a White woman who couldn’t manage the team. My Bengali colleague still does everything,” said Farzana, a British Bangladeshi community worker.
Amna, a Pakistani teacher who moved to London two years ago, recounted: “I went for an interview and they told me my accent would confuse students. They said our accents were not matching.”
Another barrier is discrimination tied to visibly Muslim identities. “Many times when we wear hijab, they treat us differently, like can she really work? Can she even speak?” said Mahmuda, a Bangladeshi volunteer, whose words mirror the experiences of many Pakistani women.
Balancing family responsibilities with careers also weighs heavily. Affordable childcare emerged as a key demand. “If I put my children into childcare so I could do a longer workday, most of my pay would go towards it. It’s not feasible,” said Zayna, a British Bangladeshi administrator.
Despite these obstacles, many women displayed resilience. One Pakistani policy manager, Anisa, said she only got her start through a diversity internship: “Otherwise, I wouldn’t really be here. The field is very White and very elite.”
The report calls for urgent reforms such as blind recruitment, recognition of overseas qualifications, affordable childcare as well as targeted progression schemes for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women.
“Economic growth and reducing inequality must go hand in hand, so no community is left behind,” Dr Weekes-Bernard emphasised. “Business leaders, local authorities and City Hall must redouble efforts to build inclusive workplaces that reflect London’s diversity.”
The testimonies of Pakistani women reveal the depth of the challenges.
As one participant summed up: “We are qualified, we are capable, but we are invisible in the higher positions. It feels like the glass ceiling is even thicker for us.”

According to a notification issued by the IHC additional registrar (judicial), the bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan has been assigned exclusively to decide matters related to the “Commercial Litigation Corridor” (CLC).
It “will adjudicate references filed under the Income Tax Ordinance, Sales Tax Act, Federal Excise Act and Customs Act,” according to the notification.
Sources said the two judges will not hold single benches until a backlog of around 2,000 CLC cases is cleared. In the meantime, petitions on their individual dockets will be taken up by other available benches.
The decision was taken by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar under the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules 2025 (Volume-V), in line with the directives issued by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) in its 53rd meeting on July 11 this year.

Justices Babar Sattar, Ejaz Ishaq Khan limited to tax matters only

According to the notification, a specialised company bench comprising Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will hear matters under Section 5(4) of the Companies
Act 2017, as well as cases under Section 8(B) of the Corporate Restructuring Companies (Amendment) Act 2021, and the SECP Act 1997.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir has been designated as a single-judge bench to hear cases relating to educational institutions, including medical colleges.
In addition, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jehangiri and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will take up cases under the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001, exercising the court’s original civil jurisdiction, as well as civil suits under the Privatisation Commission (Amendment) Act 2020. This order supersedes Office Order No. F. (126)GenI/IHC/152 dated July 18, 2025.
The four notifications (Nos 32, 33, 34 and 35 dated Aug 13, 2025) will be published in Part-III of the Gazette of Pakistan and circulated among relevant stakeholders, including bar councils, government departments and registrars.
Legal experts said that with this development, IHC’s senior judges, including those who had challenged the transfer and subsequent seniority of the incumbent chief justice, would now be occupied with clearing the years-long backlog of financial cases.

The satellite was laun­ch­­ed from China’s Xich­ang lau­­nch centre on July 31.
The satellite has established stable communication links with ground stations and started acquiring high-resolution images for sending them to the ground.
This will make data available for various sectors of national life.
The satellite has high-quality imaging capabilities that will revolutionise urban planning and infrastructure development. It will also help monitor urban sprawl and development trends.
It will strengthen the na­­tural disaster prevention sys­­tem and enable rapid response by providing tim­ely data that could alert authorities to possibility of floods, landslides, earthquakes and other disasters.
The satellite will also play a role in environmental protection, such as monitoring melting of glaciers and deforestation.
According to experts, it will help boost agricultural production.
The satellite is expected to play a key role in execution of development projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor, mapping transport networks, identifying geo-hazards and enabling the effective use of natural resources.

Frank was seconds away from launching his era in charge with a trophy until a late Paris Saint-Germain revival won the UEFA Super Cup on Wednesday.
The former Brentford boss replaced Ange Postecoglou despite the Australian ending Tottenham’s 17-year trophy drought by lifting the Europa League last term. Postecoglou was undone by Tottenham’s worst domestic season since 1976-77 as they finished just above the relegation zone in 17th place.
Frank’s bid to revive Tottenham’s league fortunes got off to the perfect start in north London. Richarlison made the most of the faith shown in him by Frank as the Brazilian turned in Mohammed Kudus’ cross to open the scoring.

The pair combined again on the hour in more spectacular fashion as Richarlison’s bicycle kick converted the Ghanaian’s delivery.
Brennan Johnson was Tottenham’s Europa League final hero with the only goal against Manchester United and he began the new season by racing clear to slot in the third.
“Perfect start or dream start. A good performance against a difficult opponent. I will just enjoy it and I hope the players, the club and the fans enjoy it because that is important,” Frank said.
At Molineux, Pep Guardiola unveiled his City revamp as he bids to bounce back from last season’s third place finish.
City’s failure to defend the title after winning it for the previous four seasons has prompted a major overhaul from Guardiola.
Norway striker Haaland opened the scoring with a 34th minute tap-in from a Rico Lewis pass. Tijjani Reijnders, signed from AC Milan in the close-season, doubled City’s lead with a fine finish from an acute angle three minutes later.
Haaland blasted City’s third goal in the 61st minute before Rayan Cherki, lured from Lyon in the summer, marked his debut by drilling in from the edge of the area in the 81st minute.

For the past two seasons, all three promoted teams have gone down.
Hoping to buck the trend, Sunderland shocked West Ham 3-0 on their return to the Premier League.
Former Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka is among the pool of new signings attracted to the Stadium of Light. But it was three players key to their promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 2017 who scored.
Eliezer Mayenda’s looping header gave the Black Cats lift off on the hour mark. Centre-back Dan Ballard headed in the second before Wilson Isidor rounded off a huge win in stoppage time.
Newcastle miss Isak
Newcastle missed the unsettled Alexander Isak as they failed to find the breakthrough against 10-man Aston Villa in a 0-0 draw at Villa Park.
The Magpies were the dominant side even before Ezri Konsa’s red card for bringing down Antony Gordon 24 minutes from time.
Isak had not been involved during Newcastle’s pre-season as he appears determined to force through a move to Liverpool, who reportedly saw a £110 million ($149 million) offer for the Swedish striker rejected.
The two clubs face off in their next league match at St. James’ Park on August 25.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said he wants an end to the saga one way or another.

“From my perspective, you want a resolution quickly. It’s taking away the focus of the players and the supporters,” said Howe “We want to be united together. We’d like a resolution, but we’re not in control of that.”
Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz struck in the 96th minute to salvage a 1-1 draw at Brighton after Matt O’Riley’s penalty put the Seagulls in front.

KP witnessed devastating scenes yesterday as flash floods caused by heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in multiple districts claimed over 200 lives in a day, including five crew members of a provincial government chopper that crashed in Mohmand during relief and rescue efforts.
Buner was the worst-affected district in the province with 208 lives lost in the past 48 hours, according to a PDMA situation report. It added that 120 people were injured, while Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan’s office reported that 50 were still missing.
 
 

According to a PDMA report seen by Dawn.com earlier today, Shangla reported 37 deaths, Mansehra 23, Swat 22, Bajaur 21, Battagram 15, Lower Dir five and a child drowned in Abbottabad.
Detailing infrastructure damage, the report said 11 houses were destroyed while 63 were partially damaged due to the floods. Two schools in Swat and another in Shangla were also affected.

The KP government declared an emergency in the severely affected districts of Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Dir and Battagram.
According to a notification available with Dawn.com, the state of emergency will remain in place until August 31 and local administrations in these districts have been authorised to mobilise all resources for relief activities.
“The Provincial Disaster Management Authority shall provide from its central storage … a reasonable quantity of tents and NFIs (non-food items), and/or any other article available if required for the subject purpose,” the notification read.
The KP government released Rs1 billion in funds to the PDMA for “timely compensation/preparedness and response to cope with any untoward situation”, a notification shared by it on X said.
It also allocated over Rs1.55bn worth of funds for its Communication and Works Department for the restoration of highways and bridges in the flood-affected districts.
Additionally, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said it was closely monitoring the situation in flood-affected areas, noting that flash floods damaged several cellular and fixed-line sites, causing service disruptions.
“PTA teams are on the ground, coordinating with federal [and] provincial authorities, district administrations and telecom operators for swift restoration,” the PTA said in a statement.
In Buner, the PTA held meetings with Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Buner Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum and senior officials of PTCL and CMOs (cellular mobile operators) to review recovery efforts.
“PTA, together with operators, is making all-out efforts to restore communication services at the earliest, recognising their vital role in rescue and relief operations,” the statement added.
Additionally, mobile operator Jazz announced in a press release that it would provide free on-net and PTCL calls for all subscribers in KP.
“The Government of Pakistan has also launched the nationwide 911 unified emergency helpline (PEHL), offering citizens free-of-charge access to emergency services across the country,” the operator added.
 






On the directives of Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, the Pakistan Red Crescent in KP set up an Emergency Relief Centre to assist flood-affected districts. It can be contacted on 0300-5849255 (secretary), 0334-9086169 (admin officer), 091-9333666, or 091-2590846.
 






Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV News provided a weather advisory on X, warning people of “a severe risk of floods and landslides on Torghar, Battagram, Shangla, Lower Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Gilgit, Hunza and Swat roads”, discouraging unnecessary travel in these areas.
According to the post, GB’s Somro Bridge, Ghanche, Saltoro Bridge and Baghicha (Skardu) Bridge were severely damaged and citizens were urged to completely avoid travel.
It added that traffic was suspended on the Jaglot-Skardu road, while routes in Ghizer district, Naltar Road, Babusar Top Road and around Hunza were closed, with tourists discouraged from travelling.
 






Meanwhile, the provincial management service (PMS) chairman requested in a letter that the KP finance secretary deduct a day’s salary from all PMS officers and redirect the money for relief work, further requesting that the secretary redirect his “whole salary”.
In a statement on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was “deeply anguished by the devastation caused by cloudbursts and flash floods in KP and northern Pakistan”.
Extending his heartfelt condolences and expressing solidarity, he affirmed: “The government is mobilising all resources for rescue and relief operations.”
The premier added that he met National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik and directed him to “expedite rescue operations in the nine affected districts of Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Torghar, Mansehra, Shangla, and Battagram, with urgent focus on Bajaur and Battagram”.
“Immediate relief is being provided to stranded residents, medical aid to the injured, and heavy machinery has been deployed to clear roads and restore connectivity,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






Buner Police’s public relations officer Israr Khan, put the district’s death toll at 207, compared to the 204 stated by the PDMA.
DC Qayum, in a statement, ordered a ban on the entry of private vehicles into Buner, stating that it was hindering rescue and relief work.
PTI’s Barrister Gohar, who is an MNA from Buner, and MPA Riaz Khan visited the flood-hit area of Beshonai and met the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in the floods, the KP government said.
 






Later, Gohar chaired a meeting at the Buner DC’s office, which was attended by CM Gandapur, the KP chief secretary, provincial ministers and other senior officials.
“Instructions were given to the relevant departments and district administration to expedite the search for missing persons, rehabilitation, and road clearance operations in the affected areas,” a post on Gohar’s X account read.
 






As the nation observed a day of mourning for the five crew members who died in a helicopter crash during rescue efforts, the national flag flew at half-mast at Governor House in Peshawar.
KP CM orders expedited relief efforts in flood-hit areas
CM Gandapur chaired an emergency meeting in Peshawar to review the damage caused by cloudbursts, heavy rains and flash floods across the province, which was attended by the chief secretary, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, senior officials and PDMA representatives, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Officials said rescue operations were largely completed and the focus was now on relief and rehabilitation.
The meeting’s participants were informed that 309 people were killed and 23 were injured in various rain and flood-related incidents, while 63 houses were partially damaged. Surveys of damage to roads and other infrastructure are still underway.

“Work is being carried out to restore road links to cut-off areas, and medical teams, food, medicines, and essential supplies are being sent to the affected districts,” the report read.
The meeting was informed that the provincial government has released Rs 1.5 billion to the PDMA for rescue, relief, and compensation, while releasing another Rs 1.5bn to the communication and works department for the repair of roads and infrastructure.
In addition, Rs500 million was allocated to deputy commissioners to compensate the families of those killed in the flooding.
“The provincial government stands firmly with the people in this difficult time and will use all available resources for their rehabilitation,” the chief minister said at the meeting.
Expressing solidarity with the bereaved families, CM Gandapur praised the provincial and district administrations for their swift response, saying their performance in the crisis had been commendable and urged them to maintain their commitment during the relief and rehabilitation phase.
“Road connectivity must be restored as quickly as possible, with helicopters used to deliver aid to inaccessible areas,” the CM ordered. “Compensation payments must be completed within two days and additional medical staff need to be deployed from neighbouring districts.
“Food supplies must be ensured so that no affected family faces shortages.”
The chief minister also instructed the chief secretary and the PDMA to strengthen monitoring and coordination between federal and provincial agencies, mobilise heavy machinery for reconstruction and immediately dispatch all available food and non-food items to flood-hit districts.
Earlier, the CM visited Buner to review the damage caused by flooding and ongoing relief operations, according to a post on X by the KP government.
“The divisional and district administration will brief the chief minister on human and financial losses and relief activities,” the government wrote. “The chief minister will also visit the affected areas and meet with the affected families.”
The post added that members of the provincial cabinet, the chief secretary, and other officials would accompany CM Gandapur.
 






While speaking to reporters in the area, the chief minister said that rescue operations have started and the government is working to clear roads blocked by the flooding.
“Routes in some areas have been restored; however, some have not,” he said. “We have also requested helicopters. Our goal right now is to restore the routes.
“I want to let people know that the provincial government compensate citizens fully for damages to their homes,” the chief minister added. “We are in touch with the NDMA and they will provide us with whatever we need.”
 






PM to visit affected areas: Amir Muqam
Federal Minister Muqam, visited areas in Buner affected by floods today to assess the damage and meet with victims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The minister, who is also the president of the PML-N in KP, was accompanied by the Malakand commissioner and other senior officials.
Muqam stated that he was visiting on the instructions of PM Shehbaz, who is personally overseeing the relief operation. “This is not the time for politics; the entire nation stands with victims,” he said.
The minister added that the prime minister would also be visiting the affected districts soon, but did not say specifically when.
 






During his visit, Muqam directed officials to expedite relief efforts, which are being supported by the local police and district administration. He met with affected families, offering condolences and reviewing ongoing relief activities.
The minister noted that the local administration, the Pakistan Army, and Frontier Corps were all participating in the rescue operation.
“Many villages have been completely destroyed and prayers are being offered for those still missing,” he said. “Medical camps have been established in affected areas and the federal government will provide all necessary resources.”
11 dead, 318 homes destroyed in GB: disaster authority
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), 11 people were killed, 25 were injured and four were reported missing during the past 48 hours.
The authority added that 92 houses were partially damaged, while 99 were fully destroyed, citing initial reports. Detailed assessments were still ongoing
Interior Minister Shams Lone said that the bridge on the Baltistan Highway was swept away in the flood, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for the second day.
He said that since July 22, “thirty-five people died, 35 were injured and four are missing in the flood waves. Similarly, 318 houses have been completely demolished and 674 have been partially damaged.”
Lone said that the GB government does not have the resources, so the Army has taken steps to help in relief efforts.
“The Pakistan Army played an important role in the rehabilitation after the massive destruction caused by the Babusar flood and provided food and other essential items to the victims of Ghizer today,” he said. “The Army has played an important role and is still at the forefront in this difficult phase.”
Later, Rescue Information Officer Shakriz said in a statement that the body of a person previously reported missing had been recovered, bringing the overall death toll in the region to 36.
Tourists trapped, power plants damaged in GB’s Naltar Valley: govt
Meanwhile, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said a “great number of tourists” were trapped in the Naltar Valley as the land route was disconnected after floodwaters washed away a huge chunk of the Naltar Expressway.
In his statement, the official said the power supply in the area had been suspended as the three power plants situated there were shut down due to the floods.
According to Faraq, river waters from the Jaglot Goro stream entered several houses and restaurants in low-lying areas.
He added that floods across the province caused severe damage to public property and infrastructure.
“Flooding in four locations in Gilgit district today severely damaged four power plants, a bridge and an expressway, while a large number of buildings were submerged in Jaglot Guru.”
Faraq said that the floods in Naltar Valley damaged three power plants, cutting off power supply to thousands of people.
“A power plant and a bridge were also damaged in Bagrot, cutting off power, while land communication was suspended due to the bridge being washed away,” Faraq said.
“A flood relay containing heavy stones swept away a house within the limits of Allahwali Lake in Astore in the afternoon,” he added. “Local people ran to save their lives.”

Rescue efforts continue but face challenges
The KP PDMA told AFP that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations in nine affected districts.
Rescue 1122 Director General Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah told Dawn.com that an elite rescue squad of 80 individuals has been formed for areas where operations are facing “intense difficulty”.
“In the past 12 hours, 3,542 emergencies have been responded to, while 76 vehicles are taking part in the rescue operations,” he detailed.
DG Abdullah noted that the teams were facing challenges in their activities because of ruined roads, while people were also not able to contact helplines due to damaged mobile towers.
Similarly, KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP: “Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances.
“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he highlighted.
“They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.”
 


Meanwhile, PTV News reported that Pakistan Army personnel have arrived in Buner as part of relief efforts. The broadcaster said in a post on X that special equipment from the Army Corps of Engineers will be used to recover bodies and those injured trapped underneath layers of mud.
“Rations and other supplies are being provided through Pakistan Army helicopters, and people are being evacuated from flood-hit areas to safe locations,” PTV News wrote.
 






A statement issued by Buner’s Rescue 1122 said DG Abdullah, Buner Operations Director Mir Alam, North Region Operations Director Arshad Iqbal and the district emergency officer were supervising the operation themselves.
The Rescue DG urged the public not to go near floodwaters, rainwater drains or bridges, and contact the 1122 helpline in the case of an emergency.
In Battagram, two more bodies were recovered at the Malkal Gali-Neel Band village, which had been impacted by a cloudburst on early Thursday, according to Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan.
The rescue operations had resumed at 6am after being suspended at 7:30pm yesterday due to nightfall and the challenging terrain.
Flash floods also severely impacted the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132KV Swat grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electric supply across the region.
The KP PDMA has said rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province.
The Pakistan Meteoro­logical Department (PMD) has also warned the Balochistan government to take emergency measures to prepare for a new spell of monsoon rains in the province, which will start from Aug 18 and continue until Aug 22.
Villagers in Buner deal with the aftermath
Beshonai village in Buner, a settlement of more than 80 households, was left in ruins a day after flash flooding tore through the village centre.
According to a Dawn.com correspondent on the ground, a steady stream was calmly running beneath the large stones the flood brought in, and though there are some remaining houses along the bank of the stream, most others were completely washed away, along with their inhabitants.
Hakeem Jan, a resident of a nearby village, told Dawn.com that he heard “loud bursts” in the mountains, then “a huge rally of water and big stones colliding and raging downward”.
“Multiple cloudbursts in the upper portion of the Elum valley caught the villagers unguarded, leaving them with no time to escape,” Jan said. “The survivors are the children who were at school away from the village or the ones who are on jobs outside Buner.”

One survivor, Gul Bacha, told Dawn.com, “Most people working in the relief operations are outsiders and there are no confirmed figures on the death toll here. I was upstream when I saw a big wave of black water coming in the direction of our village.
“I ran like crazy and was screaming to the villagers …  some people heard me and ran, but most people downstream were caught unawares.”
Javed Khan, a schoolteacher who lost several relatives, told Dawn.com that while no bodies were recovered in Beshornarry, “seventy corpses were swept away and recovered in Peer Baba and Dagar, later laid to rest by locals”.

Peer Baba Union Council Nazim Abbas Shaheen told Dawn.com that accessibility was a major hurdle. “It is almost impossible to bring heavy machinery into the affected areas,” he said.
In Qadar Nagar, another valley in the area affected by the floods, a collective funeral for 56 people was offered, where one family lost 40 people. The two survivors among them were a father and his son, who were at Islamabad airport to collect another son who had returned home from abroad.
After hitting Beshonai village and Qadar Nagar, the floodwater left behind wrecked houses and destroyed vehicles in its path, affecting major towns and villages. Images taken by a correspondent on the ground showed cars swept away and lodged in buildings, as well as flooded school yards.

Suhail Warraich, senior editor for the Daily Jang newspaper, wrote today that the army chief had spoken to him in person on the matter during a recent meeting between the two in Brussels. Field Marshal Munir had stopped over in Belgium on his return from last week’s visit to the United States.
“The talk started with politics, especially on rumours that there is some effort to change the president of Pakistan as well as the prime minister. Field Marshal Munir clearly said, during both the Brussels gathering and in his two-hour discussion with me, that the rumours about a change were completely false,” the column said.
 
 

“When informed that this ‘news’ had been circulated by both civil and military agencies, he [Field Marshal Munir] said this could not be possible. ‘In fact, there are elements behind this who oppose both the government and the authorities and wish to create political anarchy,’” the army chief was quoted as saying.
Last month, speculation was rampant that President Asif Ali Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency. The reports on social media had claimed that work was underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports had also claimed that President Zardari had set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.
The rumours were summarily addressed and rubbished by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi twice and by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry as “nonsense”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir was also reported as saying on stage at the Brussels gathering that: “God has made me protector of the country. I do not desire any position other than that.”
The army chief praised the prime minister and his 18-hour work streak, the federal cabinet and the government, especially their “determination and courage” during the May conflict with India.
“On a question about politics, he [the army chief] said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read. Although it does not specify who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about, it can be inferred that he may have been referring to the PTI and its incarcerated leader.
The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and in May 2024, demanded an apology from Imran Khan, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified.
On foreign relations, the army chief was said to have expressed confidence in maintaining equilibrium between the US and China. “We will not sacrifice one friend for the other,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying.
The army chief also described US President Donald Trump’s efforts for peace as “genuine”, and said Pakistan had taken the lead in nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was then followed by other nations.
The column further said the army chief had warned India against destabilising Pakistan’s peace through the use of “proxies”, and also cautioned Afghanistan against “pushing the Taliban into Pakistan”, or it would be met with a response.
“He said that we have shown kindness and favours to Afghans for years, but instead of repaying them, a conspiracy is being hatched against us in collaboration with India,” the column read.</p><small>2025-08-16 18:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/16204259f9b8e4f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931252/fm-dar-arrives-in-uk-ahead-of-engagements-with-british-commonwealth-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar arrives in UK ahead of engagements with British, Commonwealth leadership</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in the United Kingdom on Saturday ahead of diplomatic engagements with British and Commonwealth leadership from August 17-19.
Pakistan and the UK have been engaged in Enhanced Strategic Dialogue since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
The Foreign Office posted a photo of FM Dar in the UK today with Pakistani High Commissioner Dr Mohammad Faisal.
 






A statement by the FO earlier today said that during his two-day official visit FM Dar would hold meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Pakistan Hamish Falconer in London, in addition to a breakfast meeting with Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.
He would also inaugurate a Punjab Land Record Authority project, which was piloted at the Pakistan High Commission in London. “The initiative aims to assist members of the diaspora in resolving land documentation issues in Pakistan remotely,” the FO said.
It added that FM Dar would also engage with British parliamentarians, Kashmiri leaders and representatives of the British-Pakistani community.
 






Earlier this month, Pakistan and the UK pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue, during high-level talks in Rawalpindi.
In July, the UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after both countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and announced the establishment of the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p><small>2025-08-16 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1609313691279dc.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931238/trump-seeks-us-russia-ukraine-summit-after-putin-meeting-fails-to-secure-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Trump seeks US-Russia-Ukraine summit after Putin meeting fails to secure ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump failed to secure a Ukraine war ceasefire at a high-stakes summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, but insisted on Saturday that he would now target a full peace agreement to end the conflict.
Three hours of talks between the White House and Kremlin leaders at an Alaska air base produced no breakthrough, but Trump and European leaders said they wanted a new summit that includes Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Speaking to top officials in Moscow a day after the talks in Alaska, Putin said he discussed ways of ending the conflict “on a fair basis” during the meeting. He also said the summit with Trump had been “timely” and “very useful”, according to images published by the Kremlin.
Zelensky said he will now go to Washington on Monday, while European leaders said they were ready to intensify sanctions against Russia after Trump briefed them on the summit and they held their own protracted talks. European leaders have also been invited to attend Monday’s meeting.
Trump remained upbeat about meeting Putin in a post on his Truth Social platform. “A great and very successful day in Alaska!” he proclaimed, adding that European leaders backed his plan for a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelensky.
“It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a peace agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere ceasefire agreement, which often times do not hold up,” he added, confirming his meeting with Zelensky on Monday.
“If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people’s lives will be saved.”
Meanwhile, The Financial Times, citing four people with direct knowledge of the talks, reported that Putin demanded that Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region as a condition for ending the war, but told Trump he could freeze the rest of the frontline if his core demands were met.
In exchange for the Donetsk region, Putin said he would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the report added.
After the summit, Trump spoke first with Zelensky, the White House said.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later joined the call, officials said.
The European leaders, who had been wary of being left out of the Alaska meeting, held their own talks on Saturday and said they supported the proposed three-way summit.
“We are also ready to work with President Trump and President Zelensky towards a trilateral summit with European support,” they said in a joint statement that added that pressure must be maintained on Russia.
“As long as the killing in Ukraine continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia. We will continue to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on Russia’s war economy until there is a just and lasting peace,” they said.
Russia could not have a “veto” on Ukraine joining the European Union or Nato, they added.
In a separate statement, Starmer praised Trump’s efforts as bringing “us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”.
But Macron, writing on X, cautioned against what he said was Russia’s “well-documented tendency to not keep its own commitments”. He called for any future peace deal to have “unbreakable” security guarantees.
He also argued for increased pressure on Russia until “a solid and durable peace” had been achieved. The European leader welcomed what they called “security guarantees” made by Trump without giving details.
A diplomatic source told AFP that Trump had offered Ukraine guarantees similar to Nato membership, but without it joining the alliance.
Later today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German public broadcaster ZDF said the US is ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine.
The war, which has killed tens of thousands and devastated much of Ukraine, went on despite the summit. Ukraine announced that Russia had launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile during the night. Russia said it had taken two more villages in Ukraine.
Zelensky said Trump had laid out the “main points” of the summit and that he would go to the White House on Monday “to discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war”.
Trump and Putin emerged from their talks at a Cold War-era air base to offer warm words at a press briefing but took no questions from reporters.
“We’re not there yet, but we’ve made progress. There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said.
 


He called the meeting “extremely productive” with “many points” agreed, but did not offer specifics.
“There are just a very few that are left; some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.
‘Next time in Moscow’
Putin also spoke in general terms of cooperation at the joint press appearance that lasted just 12 minutes.
“We hope that the understanding we have reached will … pave the way for peace in Ukraine,” Putin said.
As Trump mused about a second meeting, Putin smiled and said in English: “Next time in Moscow”.
 


The former KGB agent tried to flatter Trump, who has voiced admiration for the Russian leader in the past.
Putin told Trump he agreed with him that the Ukraine war, which Putin ordered, would not have happened if Trump were president instead of Joe Biden.
Trump, for his part, again complained of a “hoax” that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 election — a finding backed by US intelligence.
Before the summit, Trump had warned of “severe consequences” if Russia did not accept a ceasefire.
But when asked about those consequences during a Fox News interview after the talks, Trump said that “because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”.
 






Putin warns Western allies
Trump, whose tone with Zelensky has changed since he berated the Ukrainian president at the White House in February, told Fox that “Now it’s really up to President Zelensky to get it done.”
Trump could not get the Russian agreement to get Zelensky into Friday’s talks.
But Zelensky, who has rejected suggestions that Ukraine give up territory, said on Saturday that he supported the American efforts.
“It is important that America’s strength has an impact on the development of the situation,” he said.
Putin warned Ukraine and European countries to “not create any obstacles” and not “make attempts to disrupt this emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigues”.
Trump invited Putin just a week ago and ensured there was some carefully choreographed drama for their first in-person meeting since 2019.
The two leaders arrived in their respective presidential jets and descended on the tarmac of an air base, with Trump clapping as Putin appeared.
 


US military might was on display with a B-2 stealth bomber flying overhead, as a reporter shouted audibly to Putin, “Will you stop killing civilians?”
Putin, undaunted, grinned widely as Trump took the unusual step of escorting him into “The Beast”, the secure US presidential limousine, before a meeting in a room before a screen that said — in English only — “Pursuing Peace”.
Putin smiled and joked with Russian reporters on the visit, a landmark for a leader who is facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court related to the Ukraine war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.

Battlefield gains
Russia, in recent days, has made battlefield gains that could strengthen Putin’s hand in any ceasefire negotiations.
Although Ukraine announced as Putin was flying in that it had retaken several villages, Russia’s army on Saturday claimed the capture of Kolodyazi in Ukraine’s Donetsk region and Vorone in the neighbouring Dnipropetrovsk region.
Trump had insisted he would be firm with Putin, after coming under heated criticism for appearing cowed during a 2018 summit in Helsinki.
While he was travelling to Alaska, the White House announced that Trump had scrapped a plan to see Putin alone and he instead held the talks alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his roving envoy Steve Witkoff.
Zelensky was not included and has refused pressure from Trump to surrender territory seized by Russia.
“It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky said in a social media post.

The storm is currently 375 kilometres east-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, with maximum sustained winds of 250 kilometres per hour.
Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend, the NHC said.
The swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda and the east coast of the US early next week, it said.
