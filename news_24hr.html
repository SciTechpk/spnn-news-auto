The country that once proudly lauded its commitment to free expression and a free press has rapidly adopted the behaviour of autocrats to stifle reporting it does not like.
From new rules that threaten the ability of journalists to report on defence (the country’s largest federal employer and third largest expenditure) to spurious lawsuits from the President against news outlets whose reporting he dislikes (some of whom settled, apparently in fear of greater punishment) to regulatory overreach and the gutting of public media, the United States looks less like the champion of a free press and more like its nemesis.
This is not hyperbole. The organisation that I run — the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — has worked on issues related to press freedom and journalists safety for more than four decades.
Press freedom under siege
Since 1992, CPJ has meticulously documented the killings, arrests, and disappearances of journalists. We know, and academic research shows, that media censorship — tighter regulations, funding cuts (coupled with investments in pliant media), smear campaigns and legal threats — are a precursor to the curtailment of broader freedoms and rights. And we are seeing precisely that in the United States — not just in real time but at high speed.
What began with the White House banning the Associated Press from its press pool (and thus the hundreds of news outlets across the country that rely on its services) in January has since morphed into a multi-pronged attack on the press.
The attack vectors are familiar to us at CPJ as keen observers of autocratic behaviour: the misuse of law to attack news outlets deemed unfriendly to the regime (this has included lawsuits from Trump against ABC News, CBS News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times); the increased politicisation of the regulator (ABC briefly suspended comedian Jimmy Kimmel after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, objected to remarks Kimmel had made on air and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, “These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Kimmel was reinstated, but some operators continued to refuse to carry the show); and the slashing of funding for public media (the Trump administration has all but eliminated funding that was going to support independent media overseas, gutted entities such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, and slashed funding for public media at home to the bone).
This matters not because the press is special per se. It matters because of the role the press plays: the role of holding power to account, of exposing corruption and wrongdoing, of helping people access information that is vital to their everyday lives. When wildfires ripped through California earlier this year, for example, listenership to the local radio station KNX News rose 354 per cent as anxious locals turned to the reliable sources with on the ground reporters to understand what was happening and help mitigate risk.
When a free press is curtailed, individual freedoms — which rely on access to independent information — are curtailed too. Fighting back now matters because failure to address these curtailments, and the impunity that follows, creates a breeding ground for further restrictions, as we’ve seen before from Buenos Aires to Budapest. And just as restrictions take a multi-pronged approach, so too must resistance.
Resistance takes root
Thankfully, we are seeing such resistance. We’re seeing it in the use of legal avenues to challenge administrative overreach. So far this year CPJ has supported eight court submissions led by our colleagues at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), that aim to reverse decisions that threaten a free press.
We, along with Free Press, have also pushed for and vigorously supported the ACLU’s habeas corpus case to challenge the wrongful detention and eventual deportation of journalist Mario Guevara. With colleagues at the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF), Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), PEN America and RCFP, we’re stepping up the provision of safety training and advice. And we’re seeing journalists and newsrooms (though sadly not all) refuse to be cowed.
It is easy to say support certain freedoms and rights when those rights are not contested. The real test is the willingness to do so even, and especially when, that defence brings potential significant risk.
Impunity — and with it, the persistent erosion of rights — thrives when those who purport to believe in these rights, and indeed benefit from them, choose silence. George Orwell called this out in his original planned preface to Animal Farm where he noted: “…the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI [Ministry of Information] or any official body. If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves.”
Tackling impunity, then, in the United States as elsewhere, begins with a basic first step: the refusal to remain silent.

His comments come against the backdrop of recent tensions with Afghanistan over Islamabad’s long-standing concern regarding terrorist attacks emanating from Kabul. For its part, Islamabad has demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, in May, the country faced a military standoff — the worst in decades — with neighbouring India. Following an intense, four-day escalation, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the United States.
Addressing a meeting today with students and academics from universities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Abbottabad district, the DG ISPR asserted, “The armed forces remain committed to defending the country, and any external aggression will be met with a firm and severe response,” as per ISPR.
Lt Gen Chaudhry detailed that “Pakistan has taken effective steps against terrorism and Fitna Al Khwarij.”
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Since the group ended a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022, the country has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces.
The statement further mentioned that during the meeting, Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the current security situation, including Pak-Afghan tensions and Marka-i-Haq,“ adding that “students and teachers present paid tribute to martyrs.
The Pakistan Army has named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq”.
Vice Chancellor Hazara University, Dr Ikramullah Khan, lauded the armed forces’ role and vowed to stand with them, the statement said.
“Pakistan army’s resolve is a metaphor for their love for the country,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.
Khan was of the view that “terrorist elements are aiming to mislead our youth,” emphasising that the situation called for the dissemination of “accurate and reliable information.”
Per the statement, both students and teachers echoed similar views, stating that the discussion with DG ISPR “had helped dispel any false information they had regarding the Pakistan army, as well as the national and provincial situation.”
On October 21, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had said that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response.“</p><small>2025-10-31 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31124330ce4435c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952344/bulls-in-control-as-kse-100-gains-over-3000-points-in-intraday-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls in control as KSE-100 gains over 3,000 points in intraday trade</strong></a><br><p>Bulls were in control at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday as the benchmark KSE-100 index rose by more than 3,000 points during intraday trade, with analysts attributing the rally mainly to the extension of the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
By 12pm, the KSE-100 index had risen by 3319.21 points or 2.12 per cent from the previous close of 156,732.87, breaking a seven-day losing streak.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market rebounded today on “reports of Pakistan–Afghanistan ceasefire talks, the end of rollover week, and renewed institutional buying after the recent correction opened up valuations”.
“Focus now shifts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and any revenue measures (including possible tax increases) needed to meet targets,” he said, adding that investors will also watch Monday’s trade balance data for cues on the economic outlook.
“Retail investors should use equities primarily for long-term wealth creation, set asset allocation by age, liquidity needs and risk appetite, and avoid overexposure if they have short-term cash requirements,” he said, adding that “volatility is normal and should be expected”.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com that after the continuation of the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the market shifted focus “back to improving macroeconomic fundamentals”.
He added that the stocks of companies that reported strong results, or were pursuing expansion plans, saw sharp recoveries.
“In the near term, key triggers include the IMF Executive Board’s approval for the release of US$1.2bn, the financial close of the Reko Diq project, and the renegotiation of regasified liquified natural gas contracts with Qatar,” he said.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also agreed that the ceasefire with Afghanistan had helped market sentiment as he attributed the rally to “easing geopolitical tensions”.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3110483221b00cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952189/istanbul-dialogue-pakistan-afghanistan-agree-to-continue-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Istanbul dialogue: Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to continue ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month.
A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Türkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Wednesday that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
A joint statement released by Türkiye, the host of the latest round of talks, early on Friday stated “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
Though the statement didn’t specify who the “principals” would be, it is expected that it meant the defence ministers of the two countries, who led their sides in the first round in Doha, would now meet in Istanbul.
The joint statement further said that during this period, the two countries also agreed on a “monitoring and verification mechanism” to ensure the maintenance of peace and to impose a penalty on the side that breaches the ceasefire.
“All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and to impose penalties on the violating party,” said the joint statement released by Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 






The statement further said that as mediators, Türkiye and Qatar expressed their appreciation for the “active contribution of both parties” and the two countries will continue their cooperation with both sides for “lasting peace and stability”.
The same statement was also released by Qatar’s foreign ministry.
 






Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, commenting on the development, said, “Just as the Islamic emirate seeks good relations with other neighbouring countries, it also desires positive ties with Pakistan and remains committed to relations based on mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs and not posing a threat to any side.”
The joint statement came shortly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had earlier issued a strongly worded warning to Kabul after the stalemate in talks — said that a “ray of light” was visible in the Istanbul negotiations.
“Different drafts are being exchanged for an eventual agreement. You can say that some ray of light is visible; there is very guarded optimism. Let’s hope that some shape emerges from this,“ he stated while speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
“Qatar and Türkiye are very respected by us and are our well-wishers. Türkiye clearly openly supported us in the Pakistan-India conflict, so we respect them and their opinion,” the defence minister said.
‘Verifiable action’
The Istanbul negotiations centred on Pakistan’s core demand that Afghanistan take “clear, verifiable and irreversible action” against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist groups involved in cross-border attacks from Afghan territory.
Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, speaking earlier in Peshawar, reiterated Pakistan’s red lines, saying that while Islamabad desired peace with all its neighbours, it “will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil against Pakistan.”
The Taliban delegation, while participating in the dialogue, however, maintained that it could not fully control TTP operatives. A senior Taliban official said the Afghan side had offered to detain and expel any TTP members found on Afghan territory.
“But Pakistan keeps insisting that we control TTP’s attacks inside Pakistan,” the official said. “These fighters are Pakistani nationals operating within Pakistan.”
Pakistani negotiators also demanded that the Taliban formally declare the TTP a terrorist organisation and publicly denounce it as a fitna — an Islamic term for sedition or mischief.
Diplomatic sources said direct interaction between the two delegations remained limited throughout the five days, with most communication handled through mediators. “Even during meal breaks, the sides barely spoke,” one source said.
Afghanistan continues to deny harbouring militants, accusing Pakistan instead of violating its sovereignty through airstrikes and, according to Afghan media, allowing US drones to operate from its airspace — a charge Islamabad denies. Kabul insisted during the talks that any future agreement must include assurances against such operations.
While the Istanbul agreement marks a breakthrough after days of tension, diplomats cautioned that deep mistrust persists. “This is a framework for peace, not yet peace itself,” a foreign diplomat said. “It will take sustained verification, discipline and trust to make it hold.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311148147655d3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952342/islamabad-atc-issues-notice-to-police-in-narcotics-and-terrorism-case-against-journalist-matiullah-jan' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues notice to police in narcotics and terrorism case against journalist Matiullah Jan</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court in Islamabad issued a notice to police on Friday on an application for the provision of documents in a narcotics and terrorism case registered against senior journalist Matiullah Jan.
The case, registered at Margalla Police Station on November 28 last year, accuses the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics.
Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan has drawn strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintain that he is being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November last year.
 
 

At the outset of the hearing today, lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq submitted a power of attorney to Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on behalf of Jan.
He also contended that the journalist had been “portrayed as a terrorist” in the case.
Judge Sipra remarked that the other side needed to be heard as well and issued a notice to police for November 8 on an application by Jan for the provision of case documents and adjourned the hearing until the said date.
Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who has also represented Jan in the case, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists President Afzal Butt and other journalists were also present in the court during the hearing.
At the last hearing  held yesterday, the ATC had rejected Jan’s acquittal plea.
It should be mentioned that several veteran journalists and human rights activists have demanded the immediate withdrawal of the case registered against Jan.
Jan’s arrest
According to the first information report (FIR) registered against Jan at Margalla Police Station, his car was stopped at a checkpoint in Sector E-9, where he allegedly resisted arrest, rammed his vehicle into a police barrier and snatched a rifle before being subdued.
The FIR invokes Section 9(2)4 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) for possessing 100 to 500 grams of crystal meth and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) for acts of terrorism.
Jan was arrested on the night of November 26, 2024, and initially remanded in police custody. However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had later overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody.
His defence counsels, Advocates Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha, had subsequently secured his post-arrest bail.
Meanwhile, Jan had written a letter to the Inspector General of Islamabad Police (IG), alleging abduction and torture prior to his arrest.
In the letter, Jan stated that on November 27, 2024, he and fellow journalist Saqib Bashir were abducted from the Pims Hospital parking area by men in police uniforms, blindfolded and taken to an unknown location where they were tortured and illegally detained.
He claimed that police later registered a bogus FIR at Margalla Police Station, accusing him of terrorism and drug smuggling. Jan said his colleague’s sworn affidavit before the Anti-Terrorism Court confirmed their abduction.
Jan also recalled his 2020 abduction, underscoring that such acts violated his constitutional and professional rights, as well as the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021.
He had urged the IG to appoint an honest and independent officer to investigate the case on merit.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3113110696e4800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952347/india-savours-greatest-day-after-womens-world-cup-heroics' target='_blank'><strong>India savours ‘greatest day’ after Women’s World Cup heroics</strong></a><br><p>India’s stunning World Cup semi-final win over Australia was described on Friday as the greatest day in the history of women’s cricket in the country, with Jemimah Rodrigues hailed for her “innings of a lifetime”.
Batter Rodrigues hit an unbeaten 127 as the hosts chased down a record 339 in Mumbai on Thursday to oust reigning seven-time champions Australia in Mumbai.
India face South Africa in the final at the same venue on Sunday as both teams attempt to win the one-day tournament for the first time in its 52-year history.
Amanjot Kaur hit the winning boundary to take India into their third final of an ODI World Cup, triggering emotional scenes.
The 25-year-old Rodrigues sank to her knees in tears while her teammates rushed to celebrate the sensational upset.
“This is the greatest day in the history of Indian women’s cricket,” veteran commentator Harsha Bhogle said on X.
 






Virat Kohli, the star batsman from the men’s team, called Rodrigues’s display the “standout performance”.
“A true display of resilience, belief and passion,” he said on social media.
 






Former men’s captain Sunil Gavaskar called the victory “exhilarating” and “absolutely thrilling”, especially because they were clear underdogs.
“They’d lost to three big guns in the tournament and then to come back the way they have just tells you the determination of this team,” the batting great said on TV channel India Today.
“So clearly you can say that the Indian women’s team has definitely come of age.”
India lost three successive matches in the league phase before clinching the last semi-final spot, in contrast to Australia’s unbeaten run into the final four.
India were in trouble at 59-2 in reply to Australia’s massive 338 when Rodrigues turned the game on its head in a 167-run third-wicket partnership with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who hit 89.
Rodrigues, a middle-order batter who had a modest start in the tournament and was dropped in the league game against England, was promoted to number three and delivered when it mattered.
“When you are left and then come back into the team the pressure is way too high… today’s innings was a marvellous innings,” said Gavaskar.
That was echoed by former national cricketer Mohammad Kaif, who called it an “innings of a lifetime”.
“Fantastic to watch free-flowing cricket by Jemimah Rodrigues,” he said on X.
“In and out from the team but she never stopped believing.” India have twice been runners-up, in 2005 and 2017.
In 2017 they beat Australia in the semi-finals before losing to England.
Rodrigues opens up on mental health battle
Facing the pressure of playing in a World Cup on home soil, Rodrigues struggled for consistence, posting two ducks and a pair of 30s before being dropped for India’s group-stage match against England.
She said she often broke down in calls to her parents as she tried to cope with the pressure.
“I am so blessed to have friends, I can call family, I didn’t have to go through it alone. And it’s okay to ask for help,” Rodrigues said.
“I will be very vulnerable here because I know if someone is watching, this might be going through the same thing. Nobody likes to talk about their weakness,” she added, holding back tears.
“I was going through a lot of anxiety and when you are going through anxiety,
you just feel numb. You don’t know what to do. You are trying to be yourself. And in this time, my mum and dad supported me a lot.
“When you are dropped, you have a lot of doubts because I always want to contribute to the team. That really hit me … But sometimes all you need to do is, just hang in there and, things fall into place.”
A composed 76 not out against New Zealand helped restore her confidence and set the stage for her semi-final heroics against seven-times champions Australia.
Rodrigues said she had only one thought in mind when she went out to bat.
“All I would say was I didn’t play for my 100. I didn’t play to prove a point at number three,” she said. “I just played to make sure India win. I wanted to see India win at the end and that was my only motivation.”

Banks, many damaged or destroyed along with homes, schools and other institutions across Gaza during two years of onslaught, began reopening on October 16, six days after the ceasefire was announced. Queues soon formed but people came away disappointed.
“There is no money, liquidity at the bank,” said father-of-six Wael Abu Fares, 61, standing outside the Bank of Palestine. “You just come and do paperwork transactions and leave.”
People need cash for most everyday transactions in Gaza, whether to buy food in the market or pay utility bills, but Israel blocked transfers of banknotes along with most other goods following the attack and mass hostage-taking by Hamas in October 2023.

Huge fees to cash salaries
“Banks are open, air conditioning is on, but they are mostly doing electronic business, no deposits, no withdrawals of cash,” Gaza economist Mohammad Abu Jayyab told Reuters. “People go to some greedy merchants to cash their salaries and they give them cash for a huge fee, which ranges between 20 per cent and sometimes goes to 40pc.”
Mother-of-seven Iman al-Ja’bari longs for a time when transactions at banks used to take less than an hour.
“You need two or three days to go back and forth, back and forth, spending your whole life standing there,” she said. “And in the end, you only get 400 or 500 shekels ($123 or $153). What can this (amount) buy with the incredibly high prices today that we can’t afford?”

For a few Palestinians, the cash crunch has provided an opportunity to eke out a living. Manal al-Saidi, 40, repairs damaged banknotes to cover some basic needs.
“I work and I make 20, 30 shekels ($6, $9), and I leave with a loaf of bread, beans for dinner, falafel, anything, something simple,” she said, wiping notes. “Not that I can get (afford) vegetables or anything, no, just enough to get by.”
Some people use electronic transfers through bank apps for even small items such as eggs or sugar, but the sellers apply additional fees.
The issue of cash supplies into Gaza was not included in US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, which also left the details of reconstruction and security to be decided.
COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into the Gaza Strip, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether or when banknotes may be allowed back in.

The shortage of notes and coins has compounded the crisis for Gazans who have lost relatives, jobs and homes, used up their savings and sold their possessions to buy food, tents and medications. Some are relying on barter to get by.
Palestinian merchant Samir Namrouti, 53, has got used to banknotes that are almost unrecognisable through overuse.
“What matters to me is its serial number. As long as its serial number is there, that’s it, I treat it as money,” he said.

In a statement, the FO said Dar received a call the previous evening from Anand.
“The two leaders discussed strengthening bilateral trade and investment, including sectors such as agriculture and mines and minerals, and collaboration under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPPA),” the FO said.
 
 

It added that the Canadian foreign minister thanked Dar for facilitating market access for imports of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
“Both leaders appreciated recent constructive engagements, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing mutually beneficial economic cooperation,” the FO said, adding that the two foreign ministers agreed to remain in close contact.
 






Anand also commented on her phone call with Dar in a post on social media platform X.
“We discussed a range of issues including opening up Pakistan to imports of Canadian canola, the FIPPA model, and bilateral economic engagement,” she said.
She also thanked Dar for “productive meetings” over the past few months in Kuala Lumpur and New York as well as the phone call.
 






Pakistan’s imports from Canada mostly include pulses and canola seeds.
During the last fiscal year, Pakistan’s merchandise exports to North America grew by 9.97 per cent in FY25, reaching $6.415bn compared to $5.833bn in the previous year. Data compiled by the central bank attributed the rebound to increased exports of textiles and clothing to the US, which accounted for nearly 94pc of Pakistan’s total exports to the region; the remaining share was primarily directed towards Canada.</p><small>2025-10-31 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31115116983f908.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952343/mobile-internet-services-suspended-in-quetta-today-for-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet services suspended in Quetta today for 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government has suspended mobile data services in Quetta district today for 24 hours due to the law and order situation, it emerged on Friday.
In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Interior and dated October 30 — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — the Balochistan government requested that the relevant authorities be directed to suspend 3G/4G internet services in Quetta on October 31 (today) for 24 hours.
“Owing to the peculiar law and order situation and threat perceptions, the services of 3G and 4G services are required to be jammed in district Quetta,” the missive said.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
The suspension also comes only two months after mobile data services in the province were suspended in August over “security reasons”. However, on August 21— 16 days into the suspension — the Balochistan High Court (BHC) had ordered the immediate restoration of mobile internet services, leading to the resumption of connectivity in the province.
According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year.
Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.</p><small>2025-10-31 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/310723071db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952295/kp-cm-afridi-picks-cabinet-oath-taking-ceremony-to-take-place-later-today' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi picks cabinet; oath-taking ceremony to take place later today</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi early on Friday announced his provincial cabinet comprising 10 provincial ministers, two advisers and one special assistant, with the oath-taking ceremony to take place later today.
According to a summary sent to the KP governor by the provincial government, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Afridi picked Meena Khan Afridi, Arshad Ayub Khan, Amjad Ali, Aftab Alam Khan, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Khaleequr Rahman, Riaz Khan, Syed Fakhar Jehan, Aqibullah Khan and Faisal Khan as provincial ministers.
He also picked Muzammil Aslam and Taj Muhammad as advisers, and Shafi Jan as a special assistant. The PTI’s KP chapter also confirmed the names in a post on social media platform X.
 






Subsequently, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that he had signed the summary for the new KP cabinet that was submitted by the chief minister.
“The oath-taking ceremony of the newly appointed provincial ministers will take place at the Governor House today at 3pm,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, former KP minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra congratulated the new provincial cabinet and wished them all the best.
 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive earlier this month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly had been criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-10-31 06:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3023453230744a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952185/plot-to-target-dawn-tv-journalist-foiled-3-suspects-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Plot to target Dawn TV journalist foiled; 3 suspects arrested</strong></a><br><p>The attempted target killing of a DawnNewsTV journalist was foiled following the arrest of the suspects by the police, confirmed the investigating officer (IO) of the case on Thursday.
Sub Inspector Nabeel Haider said that three suspects had been hired to kill journalist Tahir Naseer, based in Rawalpindi, for Rs200,000.
“They (the suspects) surveilled Naseer’s house for three days,” the IO said, adding that they had also received Rs99,000 in their bank account and that one of the suspects procured weapons.“
 
 

“Police arrested the three suspects and seized their vehicle and weapons from near Naseer’s house,” the IO added. “They were produced before the district magistrate, who rejected the request for physical remand and sent the suspects to jail on judicial remand instead.”
In a first information (FIR) report filed on Wednesday under Section 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Naseer said that around 4pm, he received a phone call from his cousin saying that suspicious people were asking about him at a local baker.
“When I arrived at the tandoor, I saw a white car with three young men,” Naseer stated in the FIR. “My cousin told me that they had been asking about me and showing my picture. While they were asking around, they said their names were Ahmed, Akash and Vishal.”
The journalist stated in the FIR that the apparent reason for the attempt on his life was a vlog he published earlier about a private company and later also reported on DawnNewsTV on the same subject.
“I filed a case against them (company owners) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and the PPC,” he stated. “They then began threatening me over WhatsApp through international numbers,” added the journalist.
Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-10-31 06:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31102032f41000e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952338/us-signs-10-year-defence-pact-with-india-hegseth-says' target='_blank'><strong>US signs 10-year defence pact with India, Hegseth says</strong></a><br><p>The United States has signed a 10-year defence framework agreement with India, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday.
The framework is considered a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence, enhancing coordination, information sharing and technological cooperation between the two nations, Hegseth posted on X after a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh.
“Our defence ties have never been stronger,” Hesgeth added.
 






According to Hindustan Times, the meeting took place on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to begin from tomorrow.
After signing the framework, Hegseth expressed gratitude to Singh for the partnership between Washington and New Delhi, the publication said.
“It’s one of those consequential US-India relationships in the world. Our strategic alignment is built on shared interests, on mutual trust and commitment to a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region,” the report quoted him as saying.
According to the report, Hegseth described the 10-year defence framework as “ambitious” and said it marked a critical step for the militaries of both countries, laying down a “roadmap for deeper and even more meaningful collaboration ahead”.
“It underscores America’s long-term commitment for our shared security and our strong partnership,” he said.
The development comes days after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Malaysia — the highest-level contact since the US imposed sanctions last week on Russian oil companies, a key source of India’s crude supplies.
Jaishankar posted a photograph on social media showing him smiling and shaking hands with Rubio, saying he “appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues”.
Few details were released, but Jaishankar posted a photograph on social media showing him smiling and shaking hands with Rubio, saying he “appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues”.
 






Relations between Washington and New Delhi had plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
Trump, who spoke to Modi last week by telephone, has claimed that the Indian leader has agreed to cut Russian oil imports — something New Delhi has not commented on.
Last month, the US also added a “one-time” $100,000 fee to H-1B skilled worker visas, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the annual recipients. India had said the Trump administration’s move was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.</p><small>2025-10-31 05:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3110302862dc5b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952339/us-ends-automatic-extension-of-work-permits' target='_blank'><strong>US ends automatic extension of work permits</strong></a><br><p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued an interim final rule that eliminates the automatic extension of work permits or Employment Authorisation Documents (EADs).
The new rule applies to renewal applications filed on or after October 30, and several categories of foreign nationals, including H-4 visa holders and spouses of certain categories of H-1B visa holders.
 
 

In a statement released to the media on Thursday, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recommended that “aliens seek a timely renewal of their EAD by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires”.
The agency warned that “the longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorisation or documentation”.
The development is linked to several recent moves aimed at limiting both legal and illegal migration to the United States. It includes a $100,000 one-time fee on new H-1B petitions for skilled workers, which became effective on September 21.
Under the new rule, foreign nationals who submit a renewal application for their employment authorisation on or after October 30 will no longer automatically receive an extension of their existing work permit simply by virtue of a timely-filed application.
Previous policy allowed certain eligible applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiry of their EADs while the renewal was pending, provided that they timely filed their applications.
The new rule abolishes that automatic extension in nearly all categories, so that once the current authorisation expires, work must cease unless a new authorisation is issued or some other basis to continue work exists.
The rule, however, does not apply retroactively: renewals filed before October 30 remain eligible for the automatic extension under earlier rules.
The DHS states there are limited exceptions — for example, certain extensions provided by law or via Federal Register notice may continue to be eligible for an automatic extension.
“With this rule, DHS prioritises the proper screening and vetting of aliens before extending the validity of their employment authorisations,” the official announcement added.
The DHS said ending automatic extensions of EADs “results in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for employment authorisation to work in the US. Reviewing an alien’s background more often will enable [USCIS] to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US.”
“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritised aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow.</p><small>2025-10-31 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/690428a5bfc36.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952323/life-in-circadian-rhythm' target='_blank'><strong>Life in circadian rhythm</strong></a><br><p>‘Life on Earth is adapted to the rotation of our planet. … There are also indications that chronic misalignment between our lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by our inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases.’ — The Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine
OUR existence is a rhythm which continues to play every 24 hours, throughout our lives. This is true for all living beings — animals, plants and even microorganisms. Sounds a bit poetic, a bit mystical — indeed that’s how our existence is.
Our body functions are hardwired to an endogenous day and night clock. We follow this in autopilot mode — not at the conscious level, but very much like breathing. We breathe all the time but we don’t have to think about breathing. Likewise, a route is set for our bodies to follow every 24 hours (with individual variations of up to four hours or so). It is an intrinsic autonomous daily routine called the circadian rhythm. Here is a super summary of it.
As the darkness of the night fades and sunlight gradually takes over, light enters our eyes and strikes the retina at the back. The photoreceptor cells of the retina convert the light into neural signals, which are then transmitted through the optic nerve to the hypothalamus, a part in the forebrain which regulates many autonomic functions, for example, temperature, hunger, sleep and emotions. The light signal stimulates a particular part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which then triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. This is primarily secreted by the adrenal glands located on top of our kidneys.

To be healthy is to be in sync with our circadian rhythm.

Cortisol is an arousal hormone, which activates the body. Between 7am and 8am, our pancreas secretes the maximum insulin and our body needs glucose, so it’s time for a hearty breakfast. Around 9am, testosterone levels are elevated, which imparts a sense of well-being and boosts energy, among other functions. Around 10am our hormones have prepared us to face the world and we are ready for the day. Our alertness peaks at this time.
Between 2pm and 6pm, our body temperature reaches its daily high, which makes our muscles more flexible and pliable. We have the greatest cardiovascular and skeletal muscle strength at around 5pm. At 6pm, we have the highest level of lipids in our bloodstream. It is in anticipation of the fasting period at night during sleep since lipid metabolism is slow. At around 8pm, we have the highest level of neutrophils circulating in our body. As guardians against inflammation, these white blood cells are ready to take their position during the night in our cells to undertake immune surveillance and respond to any cell damage.
Around 9pm, the small cone-shaped pineal gland, situated almost at the centre of the brain between the two hemispheres, slowly starts releasing the sleep hormone melatonin. We are tired, start yawning and are ready to fall asleep. Between 2am to 4am we have the deepest restorative sleep. This is when we don’t even see dreams and are unconscious. During this phase we have our lowest body temperature in 24 hours. After deep sleep, there is again a gradual build-up of cortisol and we slowly wake up, also due to sunlight, ready for another day.
Day after day, apart from autonomous breathing, a beating heart, constant digestive work in our gut, the functioning of our liver and kidneys, there is a timetable followed by our hormones which bring changes in our physiology at fixed times of the day.
 
 

The science of the circadian rhythm has been a subject of constant inquiry by researchers. Experiments have startled scientists who find that even if a person is kept constantly in a dark environment for 24 hours and there are no external stimuli of light, the body still follows the timings of the circadian rhythm. The same is true for plants. Most readers would know about the plant called touch-me-not (Mimosa Pudica), which folds its leaves on being touched. This plant has been extensively studied. Normally, it folds its leaves at night and unfurls them in sunlight. However, it would still follow the same routine if kept in complete darkness for 24 hours, i.e., folding and unfurling its leaves at fixed times of the 24-hour day.
This shows that these attributes of organisms are deeply embedded in our existence at the genetic level. In 1971, a gene was finally located in a fruit fly by American chronobiologists. They called it a ‘period (per) gene’. The per gene is “the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioural rhythmicity”. Later, another gene called the ‘time gene’ was also discovered. They also demonstrated that if these genes are destroyed then the fruit fly loses its circadian rhythm. Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were given the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine in 2017 for this “cracking the clock” discovery.
The quote in the beginning of the column is from a press release issued by the Nobel Committee at the time of bestowing this Nobel Prize. Please read this again. Our state of health and disease has a lot to do with how much we are aligned or misaligned with our circadian rhythm.
 
 

External stimuli, those in the environment — for instance, light, temperature and especially those we generate ourselves through our lifestyle behaviour — if not aligned with our circadian rhythm, can have a huge negative effect on our health and we become prone to developing various diseases. The lifestyle stimuli include what and when we eat; whether and when and how we exercise; when we sleep and the quality of sleep; how we manage stress; the quality of our social connectedness and relationships and whether we use any addictive substances.
To be healthy is to be in sync with our diurnal or circadian rhythm, and to be mindful about it.

Held on October 23-26, against the dazzling backdrop of Thailand’s capital, the conference became more than a scientific event. It was a moment of reckoning — and hope.
The human papillomavirus (HPV) continues to fuel cervical, head-and-neck, and other cancers worldwide. Yet, as new vaccines, screening tools, and treatment strategies take shape, experts now believe elimination of HPV-related diseases is within reach.
Speakers called for a unified approach that integrates prevention, screening, and treatment, especially in low- and middle-income countries where the burden remains highest. Vaccination for both girls and boys, HPV-based screening, and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions were cited as cornerstones of elimination.
As one expert noted, “Elimination isn’t just about having the tools. It’s about deploying them equitably and sustainably.”
Out of 1,435 delegates, 45 per cent of the participants were from Asia, most of whom represented countries that have recently introduced or are about to introduce the vaccine.
Beyond the scientific presentations, some of the most talked-about sessions explored the intersection of media, storytelling, and health. The session ‘Uniting Media, Survivors, and Young Champions to Advance HPV Awareness through Storytelling’ drew a full house, reflecting growing recognition that facts alone don’t change minds — stories do.
Survivors and journalists shared the stage to discuss how authentic narratives humanise data and mobilise communities. Each story revealed how courage and compassion can dismantle stigma and misinformation faster than statistics ever could.
A defining feature of IPVS 2025 was the presence of cancer survivors who were not just attendees, but change makers: open, approachable, and determined to prevent others from walking the same painful path. “Storytelling is not just communication,” one participant said. “It’s empowerment.”
Among the most powerful voices was that of Jason Mendelsohn, a 56-year-old father of three from Florida, USA. Jason is a survivor of HPV-related oropharyngeal (tonsil) cancer and a passionate advocate for gender-neutral HPV vaccination.
“I wish parents never had to choose which of their children to protect,” he said, his voice steady but charged with emotion. “If you want to keep your sons and daughters safe, vaccination is imperative.”
In 2014, Jason discovered a small lump on his neck — a sign that would upend his life. The diagnosis revealed HPV-related tonsil cancer. What followed was a harrowing seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation that left him with third-degree burns in his throat.
“I couldn’t swallow; even saliva was too thick,” he recalled. “I was bedridden, lying there 18 hours a day, wondering if I’d ever see my kids grow up.”
At his lowest point, Jason began recording video messages for his family — his way of saying goodbye. “I made those videos over and over again to make sure I left something behind,” he said quietly. “If I can prevent other parents from ever needing to make those videos, then my journey has a purpose.”
Now cancer-free, Jason devotes his energy to raising awareness that HPV affects everyone, not just girls. “A simple vaccine can prevent a lifetime of suffering, or even save a life. If my story convinces even one parent to vaccinate their children, then everything I went through was worth it,” he said.
The session also featured survivors like Deepa*, a cervical cancer survivor from Malaysia who spoke candidly about the stigma she faced.
“My own mother blamed me for the cancer,” she said. “That was harder than the treatment itself.”
Finding support from other survivors helped her heal and gave her purpose. “Now, I make sure no woman goes through this alone,” she said.
Stories like Deepa’s reminded attendees that misinformation and shame still prevent women and families from seeking care. Accurate, empathetic storytelling, whether through digital or electronic media, remains one of the most effective tools to bridge science and society.
As one journalist noted, “Our job isn’t just to report the science; it’s to translate it into something people feel, understand, and act on.”
Bangkok also became a stage for a broader discussion about HPV’s reach beyond cervical cancer. With rising cases of HPV-positive head and neck cancers, particularly among younger men, experts urged expanding focus and vaccination coverage.
Professor Praphan Phanuphak, in his keynote address, drew parallels between lessons from HIV control and the HPV response. Both diseases, he noted, require science as well as courage to confront stigma.

People with weakened immune systems, such as those living with HIV, face an increased risk of persistent HPV infections — a reminder that elimination must include everyone, including marginalised and immunosuppressed populations.
By the end of the conference, a strong consensus emerged: eliminating HPV-related diseases is feasible, but only through coordinated global action.
Vaccination coverage, screening access, and treatment availability must all rise in tandem, supported by robust data and community engagement.
Delegates underscored the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration among governments, NGOs, scientists, and the media. No single actor can achieve elimination alone. As one participant summed it up, “Science gives us the map, but storytelling gives us the movement.”
At the IPVS Conference discussions across sessions and hallways echoed a shared concern: the pressing need for more funding to advance HPV research and accelerate cervical cancer elimination efforts.
Participants emphasised that current resource constraints in global health particularly in HPV related research initiatives threatens to slow down the momentum towards achieving elimination goal set by the World Health Organisation.
As delegates departed the conference halls, Bangkok’s skyline shimmered with a sense of possibility.
The conversations had made one thing clear: eliminating HPV-driven cancers is not just a medical mission, it’s a communication mission. Every survivor’s voice, every journalist’s headline, and every young advocate’s message pushes the world one step closer to prevention, awareness, and hope.

We’ve seen familiar anxieties resurface: the perennial ‘debt trap’ narrative, alarmist talk of ‘strategic drift’, and politically motivated suggestions of security breaches.
It is time to apply rigorous, long-term analysis, instead of succumbing to short-term geopolitical anxiety. This current wave of negative discourse is not a genuine concern for Pakistan’s well-being but a geopolitical smokescreen. This manufactured noise is strategically generated by external powers who fear the success of a robust, non-Western, South-South development model exemplified by the China-Pakistan comprehensive collaboration.
Pakistan’s partnership with China is not a transactional alliance subject to transient political tides; it is a transformative, structural, and historical commitment. Its foundation is not fragile convenience, but unconditional respect and a shared aspiration for regional stability and prosperity. To understand why this bond is truly ‘all-weather’, we must look past the headlines and examine the principles that underpin it.
Non-transactional essence — sovereignty and equality: The core difference between the China-Pakistan partnership and Pakistan’s historical alliances with Western nations lies in a single word: conditionality.

The China-Pakistan All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership defies geopolitical noise.

For decades, Pakistan’s crucial financing — from the IMF, the World Bank, and other Western lenders — has been rigidly tethered to structural adjustment programmes. These mandates often involve deregulation, privatisation, and austerity measures that frequently impinge on long-term sovereign development goals. In essence, these are transactional relationships where sovereign policy choices become negotiating chips.
 
 

The Chinese model, in sharp contrast, is defined by unconditional respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. The ‘All-weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’ is rooted in this principle of equality. Historically, Pakistan’s support for China — from pioneering diplomatic recognition in the early years to actively championing its inclusion in the international multilateral system — long preceded any major economic partnership. This was an act of non-reciprocal strategic solidarity that helped China break out of strategic containment.
This tangible commitment to connect our nations permanently predates contemporary geopolitical calculus. To suggest that our necessary diplomatic diversification equates to a ‘strategic pivot’ is to misunderstand both our foreign policy acumen and the deep, non-transactional nature of this anchor relationship.
Strategic cooperation — an indispensable pillar of stability: The intense reaction to speculation suggesting strategic compromise warrants a cold, clear assessment of national security logic.
The China-Pakistan strategic cooperation is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s defence architecture. China remains the most significant, reliable, and consistent supplier of technology, training, and strategic defence platforms to Pakistan.
Now, consider the logical absurdity of the narrative being pushed. Why would a sovereign nation deliberately risk sabotage to the very foundation of its own defence system? Why would Pakistan, for any short-term, conditional transactional benefit from a historically fickle partner, risk alienating the strategic partner that guarantees its long-term strategic depth and technological edge against regional threats? The answer is a simple No.
Undermining strategic trust with Beijing is, effectively, an act of national self-sabotage. The intensity of this information warfare is a clear reflection of the extreme discomfort felt by regional and global competitors who feel threatened by the longevity and cohesiveness of the Pakistan-China strategic alignment. This narrative is a calculated attempt to induce paranoia and force a strategic fissure. We must reject this psychological warfare as an insult to the intelligence and security integrity of the Pakistani state.
Resilience amidst global and regional constraints: The true measure of the China-Pakistan ‘all-weather’ partnership is its enduring salience amid a turbulent international environment. This reciprocal support acts as an indispensable strategic asset. Domestically, the persistent threat of terrorism necessitates high-level intelligence and defence cooperation, ensuring the security of the nation’s promising future. Furthermore, as a nation highly vulnerable to climate change, Pakistan requires massive, resilient infrastructure; China’s investment in backbone infrastructure offers a structural solution to build climate resilience, not just short-term aid.
Externally, unceasing strategic competition necessitates a robust defence capability on Pakistan’s part. China remains the most consistent provider of advanced military hardware, making the security calculus the solid cornerstone of the relationship. In a nutshell, the all-weather partnership is a strategic necessity. It is a fundamental alignment that secures Pakistan’s strategic interests and underwrites its economic ambition in the face of profound challenges.
Conclusion — guardians of a shared future: The storm of negative publicity surrounding the China-Pakistan relationship serves a singular purpose: to sow internal doubt and externally signal the fragility of a partnership that has become too successful for the comfort of others. The intensity of the external noise is directly proportional to the perceived threat of our joint success.
The challenge is not navigating debt, but maintaining strategic resolve and internal cohesion. We must not allow externally generated fears to cloud the clear, long-term vision of a shared destiny and prosperity. The ‘community of shared future’ is not a mere slogan; it is the philosophical scaffolding for a future where both Pakistan and China achieve their development goals, free from geopolitical coercion.
To the peoples of Pakistan and China, we are the final, most crucial guardians of this friendship. Be vigilant. Do not let the digital disinformation or the cynical geopolitical games of outside powers distract us from the roads we have built, the lights we have powered, and the future we are building. Our bond is built on history, cemented by respect, and driven by development. It is, and will remain, unbreakable.

Andrew, 65, the younger brother of Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has come under mounting pressure over his behaviour and ties to Epstein and earlier this month he was forced to stop using his title of Duke of York.
 
 

Charles has now escalated his actions against Andrew by stripping him of his titles, leaving him to be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.
The Buckingham Palace statement said a formal notice had now also been served on Andrew to surrender the lease of his Royal Lodge mansion on the Windsor Estate, west of London, and he will move to alternative private accommodation in eastern England.
“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”
A palace source said that while Andrew continued to deny the accusations against him, it was clear that there had been serious lapses of judgement. The source said the decision was taken by Charles, but that the monarch had the support of the wider family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince William.

This was revealed in the Annual Impunity Report 2025 of Freedom Network, produced with assistance of International Media Support (IMS). The report indicates a worsening environment of freedom of expression and the safety of journalists under the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The report noted a “sharp rise” in attacks and violations against journalists and other media professionals in Pakistan. “At least 142 cases of violations were documented, marking a nearly 60pc increase compared to the previous year. The hostile environment for the media, which intensified after the February 2024 general elections, has made almost every region in Pakistan unsafe for journalism, with incidents reported across all provinces and territories,” it said.
It also documented at least 36 formal legal cases against 30 journalists and media practitioners under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) during the first year of the current federal government. The Act was amended through the parliament in early 2025, making its punitive provisions harsher for journalists, which sparked widespread outcry.
Of these 36 cases, 22 cases were registered under the Peca and 14 under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), with some individuals facing multiple charges. Most Peca cases targeted practitioners in Punjab, while all PPC cases were also registered in the province.
The report, titled “Impunity Report — 2025: Crime and Punishment in Pakistan’s Journalism World,” is Freedom Network’s annual flag publication. It provides detailed insight into the impunity for crimes against journalists and efforts to combat the menace, which undermines the freedom to report freely and professionally.
“The use of legal framework to crack down on free expression has become a tool the federal government is now using excessively to target critical voices. Pakistan cannot afford to silence critical media, which is equally important in a democratic dispensation,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, responding to the increasing number of legal cases against journalists under Peca and other laws.
Covering violations against journalists and media professionals across Pakistan from Nov 2024 to Sept 2025, the report found Punjab and Islamabad to be the most dangerous places for journalists.

• AJK planning department suspends release of development funds
ISLAMABAD: After days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday endorsed the plan for in-house change in Azad Kashmir in a meeting attended by senior PPP and PML-N leadership at the Presidency.
Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. A source describing the meeting as the final round of consultations over the upcoming no-trust motion termed it “very positive”. He said both sides called for political stability in Azad Kashmir and criticised the incumbent AJK government for the manner in which it handled recent protests in the state.
A member of the AJK Assembly, when asked if the PML-N would vote for the no-confidence motion against Anwar ul Haq as well as for the PPP nominee, said that “they will be automatically voting for the PPP candidate when they vote against Haq, as the successor’s name will be there on the resolution to be passed”.
It may be noted here that it is mandatory under the interim constitution to summon the session of the Legislative Assembly within 14 days of the submission of the resolution for a vote of no-confidence. The resolution has to be signed by at least 14 members of the House.
Under the law, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence cannot be moved in the assembly unless, by the same resolution, the name of another member of the assembly is put forward as the successor. “A resolution shall not be voted upon before the expiration of three days, or later than seven days, from the date on which it is moved in the assembly,” the law reads.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act 1974 provides that when a no-confidence motion is passed in the house, the successor proposed in the resolution becomes the next prime minister without any separate election procedure.
Meanwhile, incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can. A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.
Moreover, the Planning and Develo­pment Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has suspended the release of funds to the tune of billions sanctioned for different line departments for development projects under the annual development programme for the first half of the current financial year 2025-26.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, proposed clearance of Rs 3,721.259 million in “mature liabilities” in various sectors like communication, agriculture, education, health, etc. A formal notification barred the release of further funds for any development scheme without written approval. Huge funds amounting to well over seven billion, however, have already been released to different departments.

Sources said the FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle had accused Mr Zaidi of criminal misconduct, abuse of authority, and unauthorised disbursement of public funds.
According to the FIA, three private banks, two cement factories, and one chemical company were the beneficiaries of these refunds. The agency alleged that these entities were clients of Mr Zaidi’s private audit and consultancy firm prior to his appointment as FBR chairman, raising concerns of conflict of interest.

Even small disruptions at critical moments can hurt Pakistan’s agriculture sector as Islamabad lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations, says the report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) — a Sydney-based independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank dedicated to shifting the world’s focus to peace as a positive, achievable and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.
The report warns that Pakistan’s dam capacity can hold only about 30 days of Indus flow and any prolonged cut will be disastrous if not managed.
However, at present, India’s ability to “turn off” the flow of rivers is constrained by its infrastructure.

Ecological Threat Report warns even small disruptions can hurt country’s farm sector in near term; says Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations

“All of India’s dams on the weste­rn rivers are run-of-the-river proje­cts with minimal storage,” the report says.
 
 

While the implications are unclear, the rising tensions in South Asia and the Middle East are potentially linked to the future of water diplomacy for the Indus.
“For Pakistan, the danger is acute. If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons. Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers,” the report reads.
Foreign involvement
The report says that following the signing of the defence treaty betw­een Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the kingdom will most likely support Isl­­amabad in any conflict with India.
“This is likely to be supportive of the continuation of the Indus agreement as India is more likely to think carefully before creating a pretext for war.”
If the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) unravels, the involvement of other players like China or even Afgha­n­is­­tan can further complicate matters.
“For now, the IWT remains officially bilateral, but the 2025 episode showed that global powers have a stake in preventing water conflicts,” warns the report.
Internationally, India’s suspension of the IWT raised concerns about setting a precedent.
China, a close ally of Pakistan and an upstream riparian, also took interest in the affair.
In May this year, China’s state media announced an acceleration of the Mohmand Dam project in Pakistan — a hydropower initiative financed by Beijing — framing it as a gesture of support to Islamabad in the face of India’s water “threats”.
The implication was clear: China signalled solidarity with Pakistan, effectively cautioning India against pushing Islamabad too far on water.
For the first time, India began operating its dams outside the treaty constraints.
‘Reservoir flushing’
In May, Indian authorities carried out “reservoir flushing” on the Chenab River’s Salal and Baglihar dams without notifying Pakistan.
This operation, which involves emptying reservoirs to flush out silt, had been forbidden under the treaty (or at least tightly regulated) because it causes sudden downstream flow changes.
India proceeded unilaterally, aiming to boost its dams’ storage and power generation capacity now that it considered itself unbound by IWT limits.
The immediate impact was dramatic: sections of the Chenab in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for a few days, as India’s dam gates were shut, then released sediment-laden torrents when opened.
The IWT between India and Pakistan has acted as a core conflict resolution tool and point of cooperation for 60 years.
India’s suspension of the treaty this year marks a period of heighten­­ed tension between the two countries.
There was no armed conflict over water in these instances. In fact, the IWT often served as a safety valve, providing legal and diplomatic processes to address grievances that might otherwise provoke unilateral retaliation.
“However, these arbitrated conflicts have accumulated over time to reduce trust even as cooperation continued,” the IEP says in its report.

• 90pc of flood assessment survey completed; data of 463,000 victims verified by deputy commissioners
BAHAWALPUR: The Punjab government has distributed Rs6.39 billion among flood-affected people across the province. The amount is part of the Rs100bn allocation made under the Punjab Chief Minister Flood Rehabilitation Programme.
Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb made the announcement while addressing a ceremony to distribute ATM cards among the flood-hit people at Jinnah Stadium, Khairpur Tamewali, about 45km from here, on Thursday.
She said 90 per cent of the flood assessment survey, covering data of 569,000 victims, had been completed by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). Data of 463,000 victims had also been verified by the respective deputy commissioners to ensure transparency in the compensation disbursement process.
According to an official statement issued from Lahore, authorities told a meeting that over 98,000 ATM cards had been prepared, while 37 camp sites had been set up in 27 flood-affected districts across Punjab for compensation payments through the Bank of Punjab. Each beneficiary will receive Rs50,000 in cash along with an ATM card.
The distribution of compensation in 13 districts began on Oct 20, while disbursement in the remaining districts will start in the second phase from Nov 3.
Each flood victim can withdraw up to Rs300,000 per day from Bank of Punjab ATMs. According to the statement, 19 camps have been established for flood victims in 36 tehsils, with Rs50,000 in cash and ATM cards to be issued to 500 people at each camp.
Flood rehabilitation camps have also been set up in Bahawalnagar, Depalpur, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Muzaffargarh, Chiniot and Khairpur Tamewali.
Provincial ministers Mian Kazim Hussain Pirzada, Khwaja Salman Rafique, Malik Sohaib Ahmed Berth, MPA Rana Tariq, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen, Bahawalpur Deputy Commissioner Dr Farhan Farooq, and former senator Saood Majid Chaudhry accompanied Ms Aurangzeb at the ceremony.
The senior minister said Rs20bn had been transferred to the Bank of Punjab for the rehabilitation of flood-affected people, of which Rs11bn had been credited to victims’ accounts.
She said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would continue to stand by the flood survivors until their complete rehabilitation, noting that the process had begun within a record 26 days.
Ms Aurangzeb added that the survey in 72 tehsils of the flood-affected districts had already been completed, despite earlier claims that it would take six months. Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada also addressed the ceremony.

• Dispute between senior lawyers over list of who gets to meet Imran in Adiala leaves many within the party red-faced
LAHORE: Mere weeks after incarcerated founder Imr­an Khan warned party leaders against airing their dirty laundry in public, ano­ther tiff — this time over the leadership of PTI in central Punjab — has erupted over the social media platform X, in full public view.
In a telling series of tweets on Thursday, Secretary Gene­ral Salman Akram Raja railed against those who were “conspiring against him”, and recalled that Mr Khan had personally tasked him with conveying messages from Adiala jail.
 






Although he didn’t explain the issue at hand, a cursory glance at his earlier tweets and messages posted by other PTI leaders laid bare the dispute.
The controversy centres around the ouster of PTI Cen­tral Punjab President Ahmad Chattha and Gene­ral Secre­tary Bilal Ejaz, who were remo­ved on instructions supposedly conveyed by Imran Khan on Oct 16, when he met Barr­ister Gohar Ali Khan and Salman Akram Raja in Adiala jail.
Mr Chattha was one of the men shot and injured in Wazirabad when Imran Khan’s container was fired upon during a rally in 2022.
A notification, issued on the same day by PTI’s Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza, had announced Mr Chattha’s removal. He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich.
 

Aliya Hamza

Following the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting.
In a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison.
 






Speaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president.
In a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab.
But the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison.
“I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday.
 






Diving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her.
 






Ms Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman.
When approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal.
Some went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell.
When approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role.
List dispute
 

Salman Akram Raja

Another dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail.
It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists.
However, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar.
In another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer.
However, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”.
 






Party leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).

The section should be invoked by courts after being satisfied that the recording of additional evidence was necessary, observed Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading a two-judge bench that had taken up a jail appeal of Waseem Hassan Khan against the Islamabad High Court’s decision on April 11.
CrPC Sec­tion 428 allows the appellate court to record additional evidence separately and then decide the appeal, which cannot be intertwined with the exactitudes of Section 423, which deals with the ge­­neral powers of the appellate court, ob­­served Justice Mazhar.
Justice Mazhar observed that the jurisdiction vested in this section of law applies in rare cases where the appellate court’s conscience was satisfied that without the fresh eviden­­ce, there would be a failure of justice.
In this case, Justice Mazhar observed that if the high court felt that the recording of additional evidence was inevitable, the high court ought to record the additional evidence by itself or directed a sessions court or a magistrate to do so.
The case at hand revolves around Esha Hassan, sister of complainant Muneeb Khan, who was married to petitioner Waseem Hassan Khan. It was alleged by the complainant that he was informed by his sister that the petitioner maltreated her on numerous occasions and tortured her.
On March 6, 2023, the complainant tried to contact the petitioner after their sister didn’t respond, but he disconnected the call.
In the evening, the police infor­m­­ed them about the death of their sister. When the complainant along with his brother went to the Polyclinic Hospital to collect the body, they found violence marks on her neck, hands and feet, suggesting that she had been strangled to death.
A case was subsequently registered at the Sihala police station on March 6, 2023, under Section 302. According to the post-mortem report, the cause of death was asphyxia.
The Islamabad additional district and sessions judge-IV (east), on June 3, 2024, convicted the petitioner and imprisoned him for life. The petitioner filed a jail appeal in IHC to challenge his conviction, which allowed the appeal by means of the impugned judgement under Section 428 and while setting aside the conviction, remanded the matter to the trial court to record additional evidence and also directed the investigation officer to record additional statement in the evidence while explaining the CCTV footage to the trial court.
Justice Mazhar observed that the requirement of due diligence accentuates that only new or previously unavailable evidence that was overlooked despite best efforts, but if the oversight was due to a party’s own negligence or strategy, the appellate court may refuse the recording of additional evidence.
Setting aside the judgement, the Supreme Court remanded the matter to high court to decide the jail appeal afresh, preferably within three months.

According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Field Marshal Munir made the comments during a trip to Peshawar, where he held an interactive session with a jirga of tribal elders. Later on, he was given a comprehensive briefing at Headquarters 11 Corps on the prevailing security environment, operational preparedness and ongoing counter terrorism efforts to maintain peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border.
Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have worsened sharply in recent weeks, marked by border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul against permitting the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to use Afghan territory for attacks — an allegation the Taliban reject. After a ceasefire, both sides initiated talks in Turkiye to develop a mechanism for monitoring Taliban measures to curb cross-border assaults, but discussions have so far reached a stalemate.
While addressing the jirga, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that “despite the continuation of cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, over the last few years has exercised patience and extended multiple diplomatic and economic overtures to Afghanistan, aimed at improving Pak-Afghan bilateral relations.”
“However, instead of acting decisively against Indian-sponsored terror proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan, [the] Afghan Taliban regime has been providing all possible assistance to these groups,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
It added that during the interaction, the COAS assured the tribal elders that Pakistan, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be “cleansed of the terrorists and their abettors.”
The army chief also appreciated the “steadfast and unconditional support” rendered by the tribal people to the security forces during the recent standoff between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
“He paid rich tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of the brave people of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in [the] war against terrorism,” the statement said, adding that the tribal elders reiterated their “full support to the armed forces against terrorism and also against the Afghan Taliban.”
Per the statement, the tribal elders appreciated the candid discourse by the COAS and expressed their unwavering commitment to peace in Pakistan and highlighted that the “twisted ideology” of the Fitna al Khwarij had no acceptance among the tribes of KP.</p><small>2025-10-30 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631306-jehlum-landlord-mutilates-cow-for-straying-into-his-field' target='_blank'><strong>Jehlum landlord 'mutilates' cow for straying into his field</strong></a><br><p>

The denial comes despite the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last week directing the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for the former prime minister.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister earlier this month.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, Afridi said he was yet again prevented by the police from meeting Imran.
He was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was approved by the IHC as the designated person to provide the jail officials with the list of individuals named to meet Imran.
 






Afridi highlighted the various legal steps he had taken in order to secure his meeting with Imran, including letters written to the Punjab Home Department and the federal government, along with approaching the IHC.
“Imagine that someone in Pakistan is so powerful that they are considering themselves beyond the scope of the law and the Constitution, so now we are in a quandary about what to do next,” he said.
The chief minister added that the PTI leadership will gather to discuss the matter and announce a plan of action.
In a video statement, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, flanked by Afridi, said they both were listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today and had departed for Adiala jail.
However, Buppi claimed, they were stopped by the Punjab Police while on their way to the prison.
“What will be bigger shamelessness than this. The Islamabad High Court’s chief justice is ordering the CM in writing that go and meet your leader, and a jail superintendent — a Grade 17-18 officer — said ‘I do not acknowledge any court’,” the senator said.
Without disclosing where they were, Buppi said they were waiting for someone to “come to their senses and allow the meeting”.
 






Earlier today, CM Afridi told reporters in Peshawar that if barred again from meeting the PTI founder, he would file a contempt case against the Adiala jail administration for not following the IHC directives.
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
 
 

Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not do so again.
Most recently, the KP CM visited Rawalpindi on Tuesday but was denied to meet the imprisoned ex-premier for the third time.
Delay in forming KP cabinet
Having faced criticism from KP opposition MPAs over the delay in forming the provincial cabinet, Afridi said earlier today that he would announce a “compact” cabinet later today.
Considering the multiple failed attempts to meet Imran in person, the latter’s sister, Uzma Khanum, told the newly appointed CM on Tuesday he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
 
 

“I direct Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi to establish a compact, need-based cabinet. The selection of ministers is entirely his prerogative, as I have proposed no names,” a post on Imran’s official X account quoted him as saying.
KP opposition members have said government affairs had come to a halt due to the failure to form the cabinet.
The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30165236a25ecbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952145/pti-backed-khurram-zeeshan-wins-senate-seat-vacated-after-shibli-farazs-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification</strong></a><br><p>PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots.
A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat.
Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes.
Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected.
“Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win.
“Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran.
Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan.
 






The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO).

Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year.
Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion.
 
 

Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature.
Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls.
Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court.
CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today
Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded.
This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier.
 
 

Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”.
Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today.
He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”.
 
 

The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors.
CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.”
“This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations.
The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.
