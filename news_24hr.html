A high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the FO said in a statement today.
The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.
Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.
The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.
The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, according to the FO.
During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.
“The visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan’s perspective on the recent Indian aggression,” the FO statement read.
“The delegations will highlight Pakistan’s responsible and restrained conduct — seeking peace with responsibility — in the face of India’s reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.”
The delegations will also highlight that “dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation”.
The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“The delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,” the FO said.
‘Strategic importance and not mere photo opportunities’
Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a “packed schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York”.
 
 

In a statement, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be “mere photo opportunities”.
She added that the country’s status as “a responsible and stable middle power” is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in “regional peace and security”.
“Adherence to international laws is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Rehman said, adding that the “fabricated” Indian narrative against the country “will not be allowed to take the form of truth this time”.
“India has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,” she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian “film script”.
The PPP leader said, “Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan’s solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.
“Pakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,” she added.</p><small>2025-06-02 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02140154d1c4bdb.jpg?r=151132' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964/two-held-after-video-of-citizen-being-assaulted-in-karachis-dha-goes-viral' target='_blank'><strong>Two held after video of citizen being assaulted in Karachi’s DHA goes viral</strong></a><br><p>The driver and guard of a suspect were arrested by police on Monday after a video of a citizen being assaulted in Karachi’s DHA went viral on social media.
A person riding a luxury car assaulted a citizen at Khayaban-i-Ittehad in DHA and can be seen in multiple videos of the incident on social media.
According to the Sindh Police Deputy Inspector General Karachi South Syed Asad Raza, “Police have arrested the driver and security guard of the person who assaulted the citizen and have seized the accused’s vehicle.”
He added that the person involved in the assault has been identified and that the suspect is not a government employee.
“The suspect’s office and house were also raided late at night to arrest him,” DIG Raza said.
He said that the police are taking this matter very seriously and a first information report is being registered against the suspect and his other accomplices.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar took notice of the incident and said, “No one is allowed to take the law into their own hands.”
He directed the concerned police officials to present a report on the incident and said,“ A complete investigation of the incident should be conducted and a report should be submitted.“
Lanjar continued that “legal action should be taken against those involved in the violence”.
In another road rage incident in Lahore in March, armed guards of a private security company reportedly fired shots at a car rider at Dharampura Underpass, thrashed him and fled the scene, leaving a vehicle and some weapons on the spot.</p><small>2025-06-02 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02140000d3b6cd1.png?r=140115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914967/australias-glenn-maxwell-quits-odis-to-focus-on-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Glenn Maxwell quits ODIs to focus on T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has retired from one-day internationals to focus on next year’s T20 World Cup, the country’s cricket board said on Monday.
Maxwell took the decision to prioritise his preparation for the T20 World Cup, to be held in India and Sri Lanka, and his commitment to franchise leagues, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement.
“I think back to right at the start I was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue. I was just proud just to be playing a couple of games for Australia. I thought I was just going to have that,” the two-time World Cup winner said in the statement.
“Since then, I have been able to go through the up and downs of being dropped, being brought back, playing in a few World Cups and being a part of some great teams.”

The 36-year-old has played 149 ODIs for Australia, scoring 3,990 runs at a strike rate of 126.7 — second only to Andre Russell’s 130.22.
Maxwell’s 201 not out from 128 balls while battling cramps in a 2023 World Cup match against Afghanistan is considered the greatest knock in this format.
Maxwell, who played the last of his seven tests in 2017, told the Final Word Podcast that the toll of 50-overs cricket, especially after a leg injury he suffered in 2022, affected his fielding ability during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.
“I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how (the) body was reacting to the conditions,” he said.
“I had a good chat with (chairman of selectors) George Bailey and I asked him what his thoughts were going forward,” he told the Final Word Podcast.
“We talked about the 2027 World Cup and I said to him ‘I dont think I am going to make that, its time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own’.”
CA chief executive Todd Greenberg congratulated Maxwell for “one of the most exciting and influential one day international careers in the format’s history”.
“Glenns ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world and been one of the cornerstones of Australias continued success in the 50 over game, including his heroic role in the 2023 World Cup triumph,” Greenberg said.
 






South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen announces immediate retirement from cricket
South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen on Monday announced his immediate retirement from international cricket, bringing an end to a distinguished seven-year career with the Proteas Men, the national cricket team said in a statement on X.
The 33-year-old announced on Monday that he would be stepping away from the white-ball formats, which follows his retirement from red-ball cricket in 2024.
Klaasen made his ODI and T20I debuts in the summer of 2018, and went on to establish himself as one of the most destructive white-ball players of his generation.
“He has played 60 ODIs and amassed over 2 000 runs at an average of just under 44 in the middle order,” Proteas Men said.
“His power-hitting prowess was on full display during a blistering career-best 174 against Australia at his home ground, SuperSport Park, in 2023 — the second highest score ever recorded by a number five.
Renowned for his dominance against spin, Klaasen also represented South Africa in 58 T20Is, striking at a rate of 141.84, Proteas Men said.
“His ability to take on bowling attacks with calculated aggression made him a mainstay in South Africa’s limited-overs setup.”</p><small>2025-06-02 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02132416a4f29e1.png?r=132538' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914953/pml-ns-hina-arshad-secures-punjab-assembly-seat-in-sialkot-polls-marred-by-rigging-claims' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N’s Hina Arshad secures Punjab Assembly seat in Sialkot polls marred by rigging claims</strong></a><br><p>PML-N’s Hina Arshad Warraich secured a Punjab Assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin amid rigging allegations by the PTI, according to preliminary results issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday.
The by-election for PP-52 (Sambrial) took place yesterday, two months after the seat had fallen vacant following the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich — father of the winning candidate.
Analysts had expected a tough one-on-one contest between the ruling PML-N and the PTI-backed aspirants, whereas the PPP had also been running an aggressive campaign in Sambrial to perform better in the race.
According to Form-47 issued by the ECP today and signed by Returning Officer Muhammad Iqbal, Warraich clinched the seat by winning 78,702 votes.
Warraich’s main opponent, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who was an independent candidate backed by the PTI, was the runner-up with 39,018 votes.
PPP’s Raheel Kamran Cheema ranked third with 6,832 ballots cast in his favour, followed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Muhammad Shafaqat with 4,851 votes.
The balloting had remained peaceful throughout yesterday, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram accused the Punjab government and the police of interfering in the by-election, alleging that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
 






However, Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
The local administration, apparently for security reasons, had placed containers in front of the RO office — a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the office in Sambrial.
PPP leader and ex-premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also added to the PTI’s rigging allegations.
Speaking to the media in Sambrial yesterday, flanked by PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza, Ashraf claimed polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
The ex-premier said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said it was not tolerable that rigging took place during the by-election.
 






The ECP had set up 185 polling stations, categorising 11 as highly sensitive, 38 as sensitive, and 136 as normal. A total of 1,696 officers and staff had been deployed to perform election duties across these stations.
The total number of registered voters in PP-52 was 297,185, including 157,725 male voters and 139,460 female voters.
The voter turnout was recorded as 44.79 per cent, with a total of 133,096 ballots cast, out of which 130,837 were counted as submitted in the right manner.
Elected to serve, says  Hina Warraich
After her victory, Warraich told Dawn.com: “This is not just my victory — it is the victory of the people of Sambrial. They did not elect me for politics but for service, and I will do my utmost to live up to their expectations.”
The PML-N leader went on to thank Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that her support helped her. Warraich had served as chairperson of the Sialkot district council from 2016 to 2020.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the victory, congratulating Warraich.
“Thanks to the unbreakable bond between the leadership and the workers, PML-N continues to reflect the will of the people,” the premier asserted in a post on X.
He credited the victory to the unwavering leadership of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam, as well as the dedication of his party workers.
 






In a statement, CM Maryam also felicitated Warraich on her success. “Thanks to the people of Sambrial for once again placing their trust in PML-N,” she said.
“This victory is a validation of our policies. The public has sent a clear message that they want progress, service, and stability,” she said.
The chief minister stressed her government was actively working for public welfare in every constituency, pledging that those efforts would now be further accelerated.
“We will live up to the trust the people of Sambrial have shown in us,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying by her party.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.
The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad confirmed the new case of wild poliovirus in GB’s Diamer district.
This is the first case of wild poliovirus reported from GB and the 11th confirmed case in Pakistan this year, said a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.
The third nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025, which began on 26 May, concluded yesterday, successfully reaching over 45 million children under five years of age across 159 districts, including high-risk areas of the country.
Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease with no cure. The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five, as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunisation schedule.
The programme called on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.
GB reports first case
Providing details on the case, GB Health Secretary Asifullah Khan said a 23-month-old child was diagnosed with poliovirus in Diamer’s Tangir area.
He said that the child has not travelled outside the area, however, the virus strain has been confirmed to originate from Karachi’s Liaquatabad area.
Asifullah observed that there was a record of administering polio drops to the child. However, he added that the child was not provided with the vaccines to be given immediately after birth.
To a question, the health secretary said that the department has not announced the detection of poliovirus to the public, but the case has been confirmed.
Before the latest case, there had been no reported cases of poliovirus in GB and the region was declared a polio-free zone.
Last year, the country reported more than 70 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in February, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively. Around one million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign.</p><small>2025-06-02 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02134542ef9ebdf.jpg?r=142231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914963/french-police-detain-dozens-more-in-wake-of-psg-celebrations' target='_blank'><strong>French police detain dozens more in wake of PSG celebrations</strong></a><br><p>French authorities detained 79 people in the second such wave of arrests during celebrations following Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League win, a police chief said on Monday.
The PSG thrashed Inter Milan by a record 5-0 in Saturday evening’s final in Munich, flying back to Paris on Sunday for a triumphal parade along the Champs-Élysées, then celebrations in a packed Parc des Princes stadium on the edge of the French capital.
The PSG winning the biggest prize in European club football for the first time sparked delirious festivities in France, but was marred by violence.
On Sunday, “we saw a resurgence of individuals driven by malicious intent who were not really PSG supporters”, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told RTL radio.
“We arrested 79 people, some of them in the night,” he said, adding that order had been restored before dawn.
 


Some were detained for taking barriers and briefly blocking the ring road around Paris, while others had tried to vandalise businesses or light fireworks on the Champs-Élysées, he said.
On Saturday night, police had made more than 500 arrests across France, the interior ministry said, after more than 200 cars were torched and police clashed with youths.
In the southwest town of Dax, a 17-year-old boy died after being stabbed in the chest.
A 23-year-old man riding a scooter in central Paris also died after being hit by a vehicle.
A policeman was in an induced coma after being injured by a firework.
 


Receiving the triumphant team at the Elysee palace yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned what he called “unacceptable” violence during the festivities.
 


Many of the stars of the team, one of the youngest in the competition, are drawn from the huge football talent pool in the Paris suburbs after PSG’s Qatari owners turned their back on the policy of signing star players like Neymar and Lionel Messi.
A total of 11.5 million people tuned in across France to watch the match.</p><small>2025-06-02 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021412567d088ee.jpg?r=142052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914969/nationalist-nawrocki-wins-polish-presidential-election' target='_blank'><strong>Nationalist Nawrocki wins Polish presidential election</strong></a><br><p>Nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki won Poland’s presidential election, official results showed on Monday, in a major blow for the country’s pro-EU government.
The 42-year-old, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, scored 50.89 per cent of votes in Sunday’s runoff, the national election commission said.
His 53-year-old rival Rafal Trzaskowski, Warsaw’s pro-EU mayor and an ally of the country’s centrist government, won 49.11pc in the highly polarised Nato and EU nation.
“Congratulations to the winner!” outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda said on X.
Duda, who had endorsed Nawrocki, thanked Poles for “carrying out your civic duty” and for the turnout, which was 71.63pc.
The results followed a tense evening as both candidates had claimed victory when an exit poll indicated they were neck and neck.
“We will win and we will save Poland,” Nawrocki told a crowd of supporters at his election night rally in Warsaw soon after polling stations closed.
Nawrocki’s win will block the government’s progressive agenda for abortion and LGBTQ rights and could revive tensions with Brussels over rule of law issues.
It could also undermine strong ties with neighbouring Ukraine as he is critical of Kyiv’s EU and Nato accession plans and wants to cut benefits for Ukrainian refugees.
Nawrocki visited the White House during his campaign and said he had been told by Trump: “You will win.”
US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also endorsed Nawrocki when she attended a conservative conference in Poland last week, saying: “He needs to be the next president.”
‘Catholic values’
Polish presidents have some influence over foreign and defence policy and wield veto power over legislation, which can only be overturned by a three-fifths majority in parliament, which the government does not have.
Reforms planned by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president who came to power in 2023, have been held up by a deadlock with the current president.
Many Nawrocki supporters said they want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate conservative social values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union.
“Catholic values are important to me. I know he shares them,” Warsaw pensioner Lila Chojecka, 60, told AFP as she came to cast her ballot for Nawrocki.
Trzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.
Trzaskowski supports introducing civil partnerships for same-sex couples and easing Poland’s near-total ban on abortion.
Malgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women “unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends”.
Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, called the election “a real clash of civilisations”.
Campaign controversies
Nawrocki’s victory is likely to embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023.
Some analysts have predicted it could lead to fresh parliamentary elections if political deadlock with the government persists.
Nawrocki’s campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man and his football hooligan past.
A former amateur boxer, Nawrocki also strongly denied media reports in the last days of the campaign that he had procured sex workers while working as a security guard at a hotel.
His opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership also brought heavy criticism from Ukrainian officials.
Nawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.
“It was a genocide against the Polish people,” he said.
Poland is an EU and Nato member and a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine.
It is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.</p><small>2025-06-02 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021345262ba1acf.jpg?r=134946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914966/death-toll-after-heavy-floods-rises-to-34-in-indias-northeast' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll after heavy floods rises to 34 in India’s northeast</strong></a><br><p>At least 34 people have died in India’s northeastern region after heavy floods caused landslides over the last four days, authorities and media said on Monday, while the weather department has predicted more heavy rain.
More than a thousand tourists trapped in the Himalayan state of Sikkim were being evacuated on Monday, a government statement said, and army rescue teams were pressed into service in Meghalaya state to rescue more than 500 people stranded in flooded areas.
In Bangladesh, at least four members of a family were killed in a landslide in the northeastern district of Sylhet, while hundreds of shelters have been opened across the hilly districts of Rangamati, Bandarban, and Khagrachhari on Sunday.
 






Authorities have warned of further landslides and flash floods, urging residents in vulnerable areas to remain alert.
India’s northeast and Bangladesh are prone to torrential rains that set off deadly landslides and flash floods, affecting millions of people every year.
Roads and houses in Assam’s Silchar city were flooded, visuals from news agency ANI showed, and fallen trees littered the roads.
“We are facing a lot of challenges. I have a child, their bed is submerged in water. What will we do in such a situation? We keep ourselves awake throughout the night,” Sonu Devi, a resident of Silchar, told ANI.

The tremor was the third within 24 hours.
The most recent quake measured 3.2 on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar 3.6-magnitude tremor at 5:33pm yesterday.
Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.
 


A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.
Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told Dawn.com that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.
He noted that the quakes’ intensity was not high and was “gradually declining”. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.
 
 

Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.

But on Sunday night, here at the Gadd­afi Stadium, in front of jam-packed sta­nds, it was evident that the hosts were transitioning quite well into the new style.
And it was Mohammad Haris who demonstrated it in the most brutal of ways, plundering a 45-ball century — his maiden T20I ton — to see Pakistan thrash Bangladesh by seven wickets in the third and final match of the series, completing the clean sweep — the side’s first series win at home since December 2021.
 


The wicket-keeper/batter — the first Pakistan non-opener to score a T20I century — remained unbeaten on 107 off 46 balls, having struck eight fours and seven sixes, as Pakistan chased down the 197-run target with 16 balls to spare.
Haris came in to bat after Pakistan had lost opener Sahibzada Farhan in the first over — and never looked back.
The right-hander started with consecutive fours off pacer Hasan Mahmud before taking on Mehidy Hasan Miraz for another.
Haris smashed Khaled Ahmed’s pace past deep square, then lifted the right-armer over deep fine-leg for his first six. Saim Ayub, who had struggled for runs in the first two matches, pulled Mahmud for a six and a four in the next over as Pakistan reached 56-1 at the end of the powerplay.
Saim bludgeoned pacer Tanzim Hasan for a towering six over deep midwicket before cutting Rishad Hossain for a four, while Haris pulled the leg-spinner’s half-tracker for his second six in the eighth over.
After Haris brought up his maiden T20I fifty with a six and a four off Tanzim, Saim (45 off 29, two fours and four sixes) holed out to Tanzid Hasan at long-on.
The incoming Hasan Nawaz played Tanzim deftly to get off the mark with a four before lifting Rishad gracefully over wide long-off as Pakistan cruised. Hasan, however, departed in the 13th over after clubbing Mehidy for a six and a four, leaving Pakistan needing 60 runs in seven overs.
Haris’ flow never broke; the right-hander creamed Tanzim over mid-off for six before picking two boundaries off Rishad in the next over, which also saw Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha drive the spinner over the infield and through the covers.
Haris went after Khaled for another maximum over long-leg and cracked Mahmud through the off-side before bringing up his century with a double. He cleared the long-off boundary once again before Salman finished the game off with a four and a single off Towhid Hridoy in the 18th over.
Earlier, a brisk 110-run opening stand between Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain had powered Bangladesh to 196-6, but Pakistan clawed back in the death overs, led by Abbas Afridi’s disciplined bowling at the backend of the innings.
Parvez was the aggressor early on, smashing 66 off just 34 deliveries — laced with seven boundaries and four sixes — while Tanzid added a steady 42 off 32 balls (three fours and three sixes). Their partnership laid a solid foundation before Pakistan hit back in the second half of the innings.
Abbas, who was expensive in his initial spell, returned with precision at the death, conceding just eight runs in his final two overs and finishing with figures of 2-26. Pakistan restricted the visitors to just 46 runs in the final five overs while claiming four wickets.
Pakistan’s decision to open the bowling with Saim backfired as Parvez took him apart in the third over, hitting two sixes down the ground and sweeping him for four. Tanzid continued the assault in the following over, striking Hasan Ali for two boundaries before Parvez added two more off Faheem Ashraf.

The momentum continued as Abbas was also dispatched for boundaries in the sixth over, with Bangladesh reaching 53-0 by the end of the powerplay.
Tanzid then took on skipper Salman, lofting him for six, before Parvez attacked in-form spinner Abrar Ahmed, smashing him for a six over midwicket and following up with back-to-back boundaries to bring up his fifty in just 26 balls.
At the halfway mark, Bangladesh stood at 99 without loss. The breakthrough finally came in the 11th over when Tanzid was caught at short fine-leg by Abrar off Faheem, but not before Parvez had launched him for a six and a four.
Parvez departed soon after, miscuing a sweep to Haris behind the wickets. However, Towhid and skipper Litton Das consolidated, taking Bangladesh to 150-2 by the end of the 15th over.
Abbas returned to bowl a tight 15th over, giving away only six runs. Litton ended a brief boundary drought with a four off Hasan Ali but was bowled on the very next ball while attempting a ramp shot.
Shamim Hossain provided a brief flourish with two boundaries off Hasan, but Abbas struck again in the 18th over, dismissing both Shamim and Towhid while conceding just two runs.
Jaker Ali chipped in with a four and a six off Faheem in the penultimate over, while Tanzim hit a six off a no-ball from Hasan Ali, who had earlier removed Mehidy.

I was lucky to grow up in that Karachi. A city where cricket was not a proxy for politics, but a portal into grace, grit, and genius. Our coaches didn’t teach us whom to cheer based on flags; they taught us to revere Sunil Gavaskar if we wanted to learn the art of attrition, and Gordon Greenidge if we sought the fury of a square cut in full bloom. We were taught that genius bowed to no border. Which is why, today, I feel no conflict in mourning Virat Kohli’s exit. In times like these, when vitriol comes easier than virtue, this piece is not written in protest or praise. It is written in remembrance. For the game we once loved. And the way we were once taught to love it.

There are English summers, and then there are English summers that contain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. The former are pleasant; the latter, unforgettable. This year, the roses will still bloom, and the Barmy Army will still sing. But the air will be thinner, the echoes fainter, because this is a summer robbed of its lords. First, Rohit Sharma stepped away — quietly, gracefully. And now, so has Virat Kohli.
What remains is not merely the absence of players; it is the departure of meaning. A certain class of Test cricket, the kind that moved philosophers and CEOs alike, has drawn its curtain.
The absence feels architectural. As if two marble columns were quietly removed from a historic pavilion, with the entire structure now precariously leaning toward collapse. One could still enter, but who would stand in awe?
 
 

And yes, we will watch. Ben Stokes deserves that. The man has turned trauma into leadership and chaos into a story. He will give every ounce of himself to this series, and it is only right that we show up.
But let us not pretend. Not all cricketers are made equal. Some you watch casually; others, you rearrange your life for. Across boardrooms in Zurich, Karachi, Sydney, and Palo Alto, people rescheduled earnings calls, postponed honeymoons, and stepped out of climate summits simply to witness Kohli in whites, confronting once more the fraught architecture of the fifth-stump line. A craftsman in prolonged dialogue with imperfection, he embodied what many might recognise as the Romantic Peril of Test Cricket, the very paradox that makes the long form so intellectually and emotionally compelling.
But now? With the great ones gone, and the new ones still waiting to become legends, it’s harder to justify the same trade-offs. With Virat absent, the return on investment for five days of Test cricket has fundamentally shifted.

This is not a critique of the younger players. They are brilliant, earnest, and committed. But some of us still believe that respect is not a courtesy; it is a currency. You don’t give up five days of a sanctuary vacation or abandon a boardroom just to watch a rough diamond endure its necessary grind at the crease. You do it for the rare performer whose genius warrants the interruption of your own.
Which brings us, inevitably, to the question: why now? Why would Kohli walk away at the peak of his fitness, form, and fervour? There isn’t one reason. It never works that way.
The farewell
Great careers end the way great loves do, not with one betrayal or a single heartbreak, but with the erosion of belief.
Still, if one moment hastened this farewell, it may have been the appointment of Gautam Gambhir. His arrival may not be the cause. But it might well have been the final straw. Because when players like Kohli, Rohit, and Ravichandran Ashwin step away almost in concert, you don’t need an inquiry. You need a mirror.
 
 

Managing genius is a genius act. Ask anyone who worked with Steve Jobs, Branson, or who still survives under Elon. This isn’t about control; it’s about alignment. You don’t manage someone like Virat Kohli. You understand him. You protect his purpose. You locate his why, and you build everything else around it.
I’ve watched too many small men in large roles fumble this truth. Men who climbed ladders not because they inspired others, but because they complied better. They ended up managing teams far sharper than themselves. And predictably began dimming the lights to hide the contrast. There is no faster way to kill a company. Or a cricket team.
Gautam Gambhir, for all his grit, has never radiated the intellectual largesse required to steward players who are larger than himself. He may be a good lieutenant. But this job needs a philosopher-general, someone who understands that great players don’t just need a plan. They need belief, clarity, and a sense of shared meaning.

Consulting firm IDEO would call this a systemic misalignment between cultural intent and leadership archetype: a failure to preserve the tacit rituals, values, and emotional contracts that define high-performing creative ecosystems. Friends at McKinsey might frame it as a breakdown in vertical coherence — when the ethos at the top no longer resonates with the motivations of key talent.
My favourite organisational theorist today calls it a leadership incongruence error. Upon encountering my blank stare, she added: “It’s the insertion of a low-agency operator into a high-autonomy, high-purpose environment.” The result is not just friction. It is institutional dissonance.
I say: unforgivable.

Unka rutba tha, magar rooh kahin aur thi,


Jaise mehfil mein aangan ka diya le aaya ho koi


He held the rank, but his spirit wandered,


like bringing a courtyard lamp to a gathering of stars

An institutional misreading
This isn’t new. In Silicon Valley, where I live and work, the pattern is familiar. Startups are littered with the stories of brilliant founders brought to their knees not by markets, but by middling managers promoted beyond their capacity. Think of when HP chose Carly Fiorina, or when Yahoo staggered through a carousel of CEOs, or when Apple, briefly, forgot it needed Steve Jobs.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India is most culpable here. This isn’t a team in need of discipline. It is a constellation in need of choreography. And at its most delicate moment of transition, when what was needed was vision, they reached for order.
Because genius does not shrink to fit into systems, systems must grow to contain genius. That the BCCI could not see this, could not anticipate the vacuum they were creating, is perhaps the most damning evidence of all.
 
 

Kohli’s retirement is not just the end of a player’s journey. It is the culmination of an institutional misreading. The result is visible, not just in the cricket, but in the quiet goodbyes. He didn’t leave because he stopped loving the game. He left because the game stopped understanding the kind of love he gave it.
This is a failure of leadership. A failure to identify the why, and to protect it at all costs.
In every great team, the leader’s first task is not strategy. It is stewardship. To recognise the genius in the room, and to ensure that genius feels seen, respected, and called to something greater than itself. That didn’t happen here. And so, the greatest storyteller of this era has packed up his pen.
Nevertheless, the game will go on, the scoreboard will still tick. But those of us who came not just to see runs, but to feel reverence, will know: something sacred has slipped away.

The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, where migrants represent a sizable share of the workforce, lie in one of the planet’s hottest regions where summer temperatures often edge towards 50 degrees Celsius.
“Every summer reveals that the climate crisis aggravates the occupational health and safety catastrophe for the millions of migrant workers dangerously exposed to extreme heat,” said Michael Page, HRW’s deputy Middle East director.
“Because Gulf states are dragging their feet on evidence-based labour protections, migrant workers are unnecessarily dying, experiencing kidney failure, and suffering from other chronic illnesses,” he added.
The wealthy Gulf states rely heavily on millions of migrant workers, particularly in construction, the majority of whom hail from India and Pakistan. Last month, the UAE breached its May temperature record for the second day in a row, hitting 51.6 degrees Celsius.
 
 

To protect labourers, the states ban work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas at peak heat hours from mid-June until mid-September as part of a longstanding “midday break” policy.
But with the Gulf particularly vulnerable to climate change, HRW said  “these extreme heat conditions are now more frequent and earlier, in May”, before the midday break comes into effect.
A electrician in Kuwait interviewed by the New York-based rights group said he would feel  “dizziness, vomiting, head pain, and blurry vision many times,” working during the summer months and  “many people fall down because of heat”.
HRW urged authorities and businesses to move away from  “calendar-based midday bans,” to risk-based measures to gauge occupational heat stress.
Scientists have shown that recurring heatwaves are a clear marker of global warming and that these heatwaves are set to become more frequent, longer and more intense.
The number of extremely hot days has nearly doubled globally in the past three decades.
According to a 2024 report from the International Labour Organisation, a United Nations agency, outdoor workers in Arab states face some of the highest exposure to heat stress in the world, with 83.6 percent suffering from excessive heat exposure on the job.

The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a flurry of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.
 






Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.
“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.
 
 

He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.
“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.
The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p><small>2025-06-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021109393c34de4.jpg?r=111234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914813/rising-electricity-rates-tax-burden-still-concerns-citizens-report' target='_blank'><strong>Rising electricity rates, tax burden still concerns citizens: report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While economic concerns continue to ease, rising electricity prices and the tax burden remain worrying for more Pakistanis.
This was the crux of the Consumer Confidence Index for the second quarter of the current year conducted by research company Ipsos. The survey was carried out across the country with over 1,000 people interviewed via telephone.
When asked about the most worrying issues, the respondents cited electricity bills and continuously increasing taxes.
However, the findings showed that two in five Pakistanis believed the country was on the right track. Optimism was at its peak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by Punjab - higher among rural population and middle-income groups.
The report claimed that optimism had increased sharply in last couple of years, now breaking all records, reaching the ever highest in six years. Moreover, three in 10 Pakistanis believed that the country’s economic condition was strong. Current perceptions of economy being strong are ever highest since August 2019.
It claimed that one in five Pakistanis now feels more comfortable while meeting household expenses than a year ago. There is even better feeling in rural citizens.
The survey report added that one in five Pakistanis was now comfortable in making daily household purchases and this ratio nearly doubled in the last one year.
Replying to a question about the future, two in five Pakistanis expected that the economy will get stronger in next six months, with Punjab (41pc) and lower-middle class (43pc) being most optimistic. It is the first time in the last six years that optimism about local economic conditions has just overtaken pessimism.
 
 

More than one in three Pakistanis also expected their personal financial conditions would get stronger in the next six months. Women and young citizens were more optimistic. While one-fourth Pakistanis feel confident to invest in future, reaching ever highest in six years, confidence in the ability to make major purchases jumped to 17pc from mere 1pc a couple of years ago.
According to the report, three in 10 Pakistanis felt secure about jobs with rural people and middle-income groups and youth being more secure. Confidence in job security has attained its best level since 2019.
Comparison with other countries
Over the last one quarter, Pakistan observed a positive change (4 pts) in Global Consumer Confidence Index.
With constant improvements in the last quarter, Pakistan maintains its position above Türkiye in rankings, but well below other similar countries such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and the global average.

The implication was clear: that interacting with generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is somehow an extravagant and irresponsible use of electricity. It is the kind of sanctimonious alarmism that sounds intelligent until you hold it up to basic scrutiny.
Because if we’re going to start measuring digital behaviour by the drop, let’s at least be consistent. How many litres are poured into the void eve­ry time someone binge-watches an entire season on Netflix in HD?
How many hours are spent mi­­ndlessly refreshing timelines, watching algorithmically served rage bait, or uploading the fifth fil­­tered version of a sunset or a workout video for some Instagram validation? These, too, are digital actions. They, too, have a carbon cost. But somehow, they escape critique, not because they’re cleaner but because they’re culturally familiar. We’ve normalised that waste, so we don’t see it.
 
 

It’s not that AI and crypto shouldn’t be held to environmental standards; they absolutely should. But let’s not pretend that the sudden concern about electricity and water consumption is rooted in climate justice. It’s not. It’s rooted in a deep discomfort with change, with disruption, and with technologies that threaten to redistribute power away from legacy structures, and towards something less familiar, less controllable, and potentially more liberating. This is much less about the energy, or the climate, and much more about inertia masquerading as morality.
At the cost of repetition, the point is not to excuse AI’s energy demands but to highlight the absurdity of pretending that prompting GPT is where the guilt should begin. These criticisms aren’t rooted in environmental justice but the fear of technological disruption, especially of tools that could shift knowledge creation, creative production, and economic opportunity outside the gates of elite institutions.

Pakistan’s newfound enthusiasm for crypto doesn’t have to follow the chaotic arc seen elsewhere.

I’ve been noticing similar fear-mongering around Pakistan’s recent interest in crypto and AI, especially the chorus of concern over energy consumption. The government’s announcement to dedicate two gigawatts of power towards AI data centres and crypto mining has triggered a kind of moral panic that feels less about climate and more about control.
 
 

Overnight, everyone’s turned into an energy auditor, as if this country hasn’t spent decades watching power get siphoned off by inefficient state-owned enterprises, bloated real estate empires, and unmetered political favour. Now, when the state finally signals an intention to invest in frontier tech, industries that might bring Pakistan into the modern digital economy, it’s met with outrage dressed up as environmentalism.
Let’s be honest: this isn’t about the electricity. It’s about the shift. About newer, faster players entering spaces traditionally guarded by bureaucracy and old power structures. It’s about the fear of Pakistan participating in a world its critics no longer fully understand.
If we’re serious about addressing the environmental cost of emerging technologies like AI and crypto, the answer is to steer it responsibly, and not outrightly shut it down. That means demanding transparency from data centres on their ener­­gy and water use, pushing for cleaner energy integration, and incentivising green infrastructure, not stoking public fear to stall progress.
An inclusive approach understands that Pakistan, already trailing in tech, can’t afford to sit out the AI revolution. At the same time, it also can’t replicate the dirty models of the past. The task is to build a roadmap where innovation and sustainability are­­n’t seen as opposing forces but as twin imperatives.
But that roadmap can’t be built in isolation. Voluntary commitments by tech companies to switch to clean energy have, time and again, proven inadequate. What’s needed now is serious advocacy that targets global forums, from the United Nations to international standard-setting bodies, to push for binding protocols that compel technology firms to meet stringent environmental obligations. The burden of sustainability cannot rest on consumer guilt or national regulation alone; it must be enforced at the level where tech power actually resides.
As for Pakistan’s new love for crypto, there are far more pressing questions to be asked than the performative panic over electricity consumption. Who is shaping the regulatory framework? Who stands to benefit, and who might be excluded? Is this going to be another playground for politically connected actors to mine profit under the guise of innovation, or can it become a legitimate avenue for financial inclusion in a country where access to traditional banking remains out of reach for millions?
The energy question is real, but it can’t be the only lens. We need to talk about transparency, governance, digital rights and whether this tech will empower or further marginalise. The conversation must move past the performative activism and dig into the architecture being quietly built. If we don’t shape it now, we’ll find ourselves locked out of systems that claim to be open.
Pakistan’s newfound enthusiasm for crypto doesn’t have to follow the chaotic, exploitative arc seen elsewhere. This moment presents a chance to do it differently, to design systems that are transparent, inclusive, and locally rooted. Crypto can be more than just speculative trading and mining farms; it can be a way to reimagine financial access, to build tools for remittances, savings, and digital ownership for people excluded from formal banking. But that requires intent.
We need a regulatory framework built in consultation with technologists, civil society, and financial experts, and not just the enforcement bodies. We need clarity, not criminalisation; guardrails, not gatekeeping.
If Pakistan wants to embrace crypto, it must also invest in public literacy, consumer protections, and infrastructure that ensures the benefits are not just concentrated at the top. This doesn’t have to be a rushed gold rush. It can be a careful, deliberate step towards something fairer, but only if we’re brave enough to move past the performative actions.

LAHORE: President Asif Ali Zardari greets PM Shehbaz Sharif ahead of their meeting at Governor’s House.—White Star

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met on Sunday to discuss the political climate and security challenges facing the country, and vowed to cement the coalition bond in the ‘national interest’.
PM Shehbaz met President Zardari at Governor House in Lahore, where both leaders also discussed the upcoming federal budget along with political situation in the country.
 






“Political allies need to move forward together in the national interest,” an official release quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
He emphasised the need for unity among all coalition partners, including PML-N and PPP.
During the meeting, the leaders held wide-ranging discussions on national affairs, including the prevailing political and security situation in the country.

The participants also reviewed the outcome of the prime minister’s recent visit to friendly nations and their significance for Pakistan’s foreign relations.
The meeting was also attended by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
People-friendly budget
President Zardari, while highlighting the importance of public welfare, urged the government to take practical and impactful steps in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man.
“The government must take measures in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man,” he added.
A source in the PMO said the premier also apprised President Zardari about his visit to Quetta along with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and their meeting with a grand jirga of the elders of Balochistan’s different tribes and clans.
PM Shehbaz expressed the hope that the meeting with jirga will bear fruit and help restore peace in the province.
Earlier, Field Marshal Munir, in his address at the jirga, vowed to “crush” terrorists in Balochistan, stating that India’s involvement in terrorist activities in the province was “no longer hidden”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
The grand jirga was organised in Quetta a day earlier to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with focus on terrorists receiving support from India.
Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.

Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that Constable Shaharyar Ali, 28, was heading some place on his motorbike at around 3:05am when armed assailants, also on a motorcycle, targeted him on Shahrah-i-Pakistan near near Kashti Chowk within the remit of the Yousuf Plaza police station.
He sustained a single bullet wound in the abdomen and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where he died during treatment.
Police sources said that the investigators have obtained CCTV footage near the crime scene. The footage is blurred but it showed that the policeman had stopped his motorbike on the road. In the meantime, two assailants riding a motorcycle emerged there, fired at him and rode away without taking any valuables from him.

No breakthrough made in murder investigation of traffic constable shot dead on May 27, says CTD

The victim was posted at the Anti-Vehicles Lifting Cell (AVLC) and a resident of the Buffer Zone area. He was not in uniform at the time of the incident.
 
 

It appeared to be an incident of targeted killing, but police were investigating the matter to find out the exact motive, the SSP said.
He said the murder did not seem to be robbery related as the killers did not take away slain constable’s pistol, his cell phone, cash and motorbike.
Area SHO Iftikhar Khanzada told Dawn that no case was registered till late in the night as the family was busy in making funeral arrangements.
In a short span of five days, it is the second incident of targeted killing involving a policeman.
Earlier on May 27, an on-duty traffic policeman, Zain Ali Raza, was shot dead within the remit of the Boat Basin police station. Later, a little known group had claimed responsibility for the targeted attack on its Telegram channel.
The police had registered a terrorism case and transferred the investigations to the Counter-Terrorism Department as senior police officers feared resurgence of some banned outfits. Investigators suspected involvement of their sleeper cells in the killing.
So far, no arrest has been made in connection with the May 27 targeted killing case.
CTD DIG Asif Ejaz Sheikh told Dawn that they launched an investigation into the killing of the AVLC policeman.
He, however, said it would be premature to say anything concrete at this moment about the exact motive of the murder.
Regarding the Boat Basin incident, he said that the CTD was working on many leads, but so far, no concrete evidence had emerged about the involvement of any militant group.
He said that the group that had claimed responsibility on Telegram just used its name as ‘Mujahideen’ without naming any specific faction of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The DIG said that the outlawed TTP or Balochistan Liberation Army had used their own social media handles to claim responsibility for their attacks.

Even as he warned in a speech on Saturday that China posed an “imminent” threat, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made clear he wanted Europeans to concentrate on European security as they boosted military budgets.
“We would much prefer that the overwhelming balance of European investment be on that continent…so that as we partner there, which we will continue to do, we’re able to use our comparative advantage as an Indo-Pacific nation to support our partners here,” he said.
Hegseth also noted the absence of his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun, as Beijing instead dispatched a low-level team of military scholars to the annual event, which attracts top defence officials, diplomats, spies and arms dealers from across the world.
The other highlight of the event was the presence of high-powered military delegations from India and Pakistan after four days of intense clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours that were halted by a ceasefire on May 10.
 
 

The delegations, in full uniform and bristling with medal and service ribbons, were led by India’s highest ranking military officer and Pakistan’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. They pointedly kept out of each other’s way in the corridors and meeting halls of the sprawling Shangri-La hotel. On engaging in Asia, at least some European nations signalled they would not be swayed by the US exhortations.
They insisted they would try to stay in both the Asian and European theatres, noting their deep links and vital trade flows as well as the global nature of conflict.
“It is a good thing we are doing more (in Europe), but what I want to stress is that the security of Europe and the security of the Pacific is very much interlinked,” said Europe’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas.
“If you are worried about China, you should be worried about Russia,” Kallas said, underlining the importance of Chinese assistance to the Russian war effort in Ukraine and Moscow’s deployment of North Korean soldiers.
France’s Asian ties
French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that his nation remains an Indo-Pacific power, alluding to its enduring colonial presence in New Caledonia and French Polynesia and the basing of over 8,000 soldiers across the region.
“We are neither China nor the US, we don’t want to depend on either of them,” Macron said at a press conference on Friday, outlining a  “third path” coalition between Europe and Asia that avoided having to choose between Beijing and Washington.
“We want to cooperate with both as far as we can, and we can cooperate for growth and prosperity and stability for our people and the world order, and I think this is exactly the same view of a lot of countries and a lot of people of this region,” he said.
Beyond the rhetoric, regional military attaches and analysts say the European regional presence — and ambitions — may not be easy to shift. Military deployments are mapped out over decades rather than months, and both commercial and defence relationships go back decades, some of them only rarely publicly acknowledged.
The visit of a British aircraft carrier to Singapore later this month is part of a programme first mentioned by then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in 2017 to stress British support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
The carrier visit in part reflects Britain’s commitments under the 54-year-old Five-Power Defence Arrangement that links its military with counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.
British ties with Australia have been bolstered with the recent three-way AUKUS submarine and advanced technology sharing agreement struck with the US — a move that could see British submarines visiting Western Australia.
Singapore, meanwhile, keeps 200 personnel in France operating 12 of its light combat aircraft while Britain also has a jungle training camp and helicopters in Brunei and a 1,200-strong Gurkha battalion, according to International Institute of Strategic Studies data.
A report last month by the London-based IISS highlighted European defence firms’ long-standing and expanding defence ties to Asia, even in the face of competition, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as regional budgets rise.
“European companies, including Airbus, Damen, Naval Group and Thales, have a long-standing presence in Southeast Asia, and other European actors have established themselves in the market in the last decade, including Italy’s Fincantieri and Sweden’s Saab,” the IISS study said.
Saab is close to securing a deal with US ally Thailand to supply its Gripen fighters, beating out Lockheed Martin’s F-16s. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has reported that Asian defence spending rose 46pc in the decade to 2024, reaching $629 billion.
For Finnish officials at least, Hegseth’s remarks resonated — it is Moscow rather than the Indo-Pacific that looms large for Helsinki given the country’s long Russian border.
“When Europe’s defence is in a good shape, then you will have resources to do something more,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen said. “But now all the European countries must do their main focus on European defence so that the United States can do a bigger share in the Indo-Pacific area,” Hakkanen said.

• All fuel stations may be legally required to offer digital payment modes
• Manufacturers, importers may charge extra 2pc GST on cash sales
• Emphasis will be on low-cost digital options instead of costlier POS systems
• Minor tax rate cut expected for salaried class
ISLAMABAD: As part of its strategic direction to declare ‘war on cash’, the federal government is likely to introduce differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital payments across various sectors, including fuel pricing, in the upcoming budget.
This is going to be the most crucial step among many other things that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has been hinting at in recent days and may unveil during his budget speech on June 10.
According to sources, the next year’s budget would also be envisaging lower tax rate on the salaried class — though by a tiny margin of 1 to 1.5 percentage points — under strict directions of the prime minister to give a message that the government is at least beginning to ease burden where tax rates are too high, even if it is unable to reduce them significantly.
Sources also said that policymakers had already been working on the technical and administrative aspects of the move to support the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which has failed miserably so far to document retail businesses in a manner that could yield revenue outcomes over the past two decades, despite repeated attempts and models.
 
 

The finance minister is believed to have held at least three successive consultative sessions with the FBR, the Ministry of Petroleum, banks, financial institutions, and a few hired or co-opted consultancy firms to explore technical solutions.
The campaign against the cash-based economy would work both ways — from top-down and bottom-up — to encourage and compel both consumers and businesses to reduce costs for documented transactions and increase expenses for cash. It aims to gradually shift the economy from low-cash to eventually cashless, where technically feasible.
An official said that all petrol pumps across the country — from Chaman to Khyber and Karachi to Azad Kashmir — would be required by law to provide digital options, including QR codes, debit and credit cards, and mobile payment services, in addition to cash.
The government-notified petroleum prices would apply only to digital transactions, while cash sales would involve an additional cost of about Rs2-3 per litre.
Consumers would be free to conduct cash transactions at a higher rate, but would be encouraged to opt for digital payments instead.
“This is a regulated environment and implementable at the outset,” the official said, adding that this would also help track petroleum supplies from borders and ports to refineries and depots.
On the other hand, importers and manufacturers would have to charge a standard 18 per cent general sales tax on digital payments from their suppliers or retailers, with an additional 2pc GST applicable on sales settled in cash.
Extra cost
“If wholesalers, distributors and retailers are ready to pay higher tax and their customers are willing to absorb the additional cost, it’s their choice, but it will involve substantial finances,” an official said.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial, when approached for comment, said only: “We must move towards a cashless economy,” but declined to elaborate ahead of the budget announcement.
Sources said the new initiative might appear synonymous with the filer and non-filer categories for banking transactions — a policy that did not yield desired results given its limited scope. However, the new policy is likely to have far greater outreach, capturing even small and informal business transactions through a carrot-and-stick approach.
The Finance Bill 2025-26 would provide a piece of legislation under which every business — big or small — would be required to offer cash and digital options. The cash transaction would carry an additional tax or fee compared to digital payments.
Unlike digital options like point-of-sale systems, which involve additional expenditure in the form of POS machines, payments under the upcoming scheme will also be available through simple QR codes and other digital solutions. Countries like India, Indonesia, and Bangla­desh have reportedly achieved landmark successes in this regard.
Another official said the FBR has been unable to persuade major businesses — including event managers, jewellers, marriage halls, and many professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and beauty salons — to shift away from cash to digital solutions.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Finance Minister Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Earlier, he announced the government’s “war on cash” as part of a strategy to tap into over Rs9.3 trillion in circulation and maximise revenue potential. He has been talking about maximum utilisation of technology, end-to-end digitisation and auditing towards this end besides simplifying processes.
The finance minister also put on record some time ago that non-filers and under-filers were evading taxes of around Rs1.3tr at the individual level. “We must declare war on cash if we aspire to join the G20 (a group of major economies),” he said, adding that it was only possible when transactions are documented.
According to the minister, Pakistan’s economy was potentially valued at more than $700 billion — significantly higher than the current estimate of $410bn — leading to over Rs7tr in annual tax evasion. “We will ensure this documentation,” he promised.
On the petroleum side, the government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly last month to digitally track petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration. The practice causes massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually, besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The dual-pricing mechanism in the upcoming budget is expected to complement that legislative move and provide end-to-end traceability across the fuel supply chain.

As the HRCP report rightly underscores, Peca has morphed into a blunt instrument used to silence critics, muzzle the press and weaken fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.
From political workers to TikTokers, and even a police officer critical of the presidency, the law’s application has grown alarmingly broad and punitive. What was initially framed as a measure against cybercrime now operates more as a tool of political retribution.
 
 

The criminalisation of vaguely defined terms such as ‘false information’ and the unchecked power vested in regulatory bodies dominated by the executive mark a steady and dangerous shift towards authoritarianism — a shift that is playing out before the world even as the government pretends otherwise.
The report paints a dire picture: offences that were once bailable and non-cognizable are now treated as serious crimes. The newly created National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency lacks transparency and safeguards; and the economic intimidation of journalists, such as freezing bank accounts, is the new normal.
Nowhere is this crackdown felt more acutely than in regions already under pressure, such as Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, where connectivity is hyper-regulated and journalistic work is fraught with risk.
The state’s argument for curbing disinformation cannot be used to justify the silencing of legitimate criticism. Democracies thrive on and are underpinned by accountability, and the strength of the latter depends on the freedom to speak truth to power. Peca, in its current form, does not protect the public; instead, it protects those in power from the scrutiny of the public.
What is particularly significant in the HRCP report is the call to establish a national coalition of civil society, journalists and political stakeholders. This is not merely a procedural suggestion but a democratic necessity.
The government should seize this opportunity to open dialogue and reform repressive laws before it slides further into autocracy. Ignoring this call would be a grave misstep. The repeal of Peca is not just a legal correction, but a moral and democratic obligation. Pakistan must choose whether it wants to be seen as a nation that safeguards speech or one that penalises it.

A police spokesperson said a tip-off was received regarding the movement of militants in the area of Kot Mubarak on the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border. These suspects were reportedly spreading fear and panic among civilians at various locations.
Upon receiving the information, police teams swiftly launched an operation, cordoning off the area and initiating a targeted raid.
The terrorists, armed with heavy weapons, launched an attack on police. However, the Punjab Police responded with a timely and effective counter-operation, thwarting the terrorists’ plans.
 
 

During the encounter, four militants were shot dead while their accomplices managed to escape, taking cover of the bushes and sand dunes. The dead militants could not be identified.
Police seized weapons from the deceased terrorists. A thorough search and sweep operation is currently underway in the area to apprehend any remaining hostile elements.
The operation was conducted under the supervision of Dera Ghazi Khan, Regional Police Officer retired Capt Sajjad Hassan Khan and District Police Officer Syed Ali.
Inspector General of Punjab Police, Dr Usman Anwar, lauded the Dera Ghazi Khan police for eliminating the four terrorists, commending their bravery and swift action.

Local importers and exporters have been protesting against what they call the exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
A local PML-N leader said the federal government — led by his party — was not serious in addressing the protesters’ demand.
 
 

The sit-in against the revenue body entered its third day at Gulmat Nagar on Sunday.
The protesters have vowed the road connecting Pakistan with China will remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.
Thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded on both sides of the road for many hours, with long queues of vehicles seen on both sides on Sunday.
‘Economic murder’
The call for protest was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Comm­it­tee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Impor­ters and Exporters Asso­ciation; Gilgit-Nagar Cham­ber of Commerce; and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
On Sunday, people from all walks of life participated in the sit-in.
Meanwhile, various delegations of traders, scholars, civil society members from Hunza, Nagar, Gilgit and other areas joined the protesters. The protest leaders, Abbas Mir, Ebad Nagari, Muhammad Ismail and others, said thousands of protesters had been sitting on the road for the past three days but the authorities were reluctant to listen to their genuine grievances.
They lamented GB has “no industry” or employment opportunities in the private sector. The trade activity between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass was the biggest source of income for locals, they added.
They added people affiliated with this trade — transporters, shopkeepers, labourers, customs clearance agents, hotel owners, small businessmen — have been jobless for the last seven months due to the suspension of trade at Khunjerab Pass.
They said protesters have been demanding the clearance of over 240 consignments stuck at Sost Dry port for the past last seven months under a one-time amnesty scheme, as traders cannot afford billions of rupees in losses.
They said the policies of FBR and Customs at Sost Dry Port “economically murdered” locals.
They claimed that locals with border passes were not allowed to import items from China and the barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province of China has been suspended.
The traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between GB and Xinjiang under the 1985 border agreement.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within GB, the protest leaders demanded.
GB has a disputed status, yet local traders are paying all taxes and customs duties on imported goods.
Failed talks
Addressing the protesters, the president of PML-N Nagar chapter, Javed Hussain, said the federal government was “not serious in settling the issue”.
Mr Hussain, also a former member of GB Assembly, said trade policies at other ports of the country have been relaxed beca­use “people of those areas have representation in parliament”.
“GB people have been paying all taxes, yet the FBR is reluctant to clear their consignments.
He said no taxation without representation was a universal law and the people of GB were neither given representation in parliament nor exemption from taxes.
“The government of Pakistan even gave amnesty to high-profile terrorists. So, giving a one-time amnesty to clear 250 consignments after paying taxes was not a big demand,” he said
GB Home Minister Shams Lone, assembly member Ayub Waziri and other officials met the protesters and tried to convince them to end the protest. However, the talks failed to produce results.
The government delegations told the protesters that their demands were “genuine” and supported by the GB government.
They added that the issues were related to the federal government, and the chief minister has already sent recommendations to Islamabad.
Muhammad Ali Quaid, special assistant to chief minister, told the media that the GB government has no power to solve the demands of the protesters.
He said the issue will be discussed in the upcoming meeting of the apex committee, including civil and military leaders.

• Punjab minister plays down claims, says PP-52 constituents ‘expressed full confidence’ in CM Maryam
NAROWAL/GUJRAT: As the PML-N candidate seemed poised to clinch the by-election on a provincial assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin, rival candidates alleged interference by the ruling party to manipulate results with the help of the administration and police on Sunday.
The balloting remained peaceful throughout the day, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
By the time this report went to press, unofficial results indicated that PML-N candidate Hina Arshad Warraich had clinched the seat with 78,702 votes against PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhir Nashat Ghumman’s 39,018 votes.
 
 
,

In a statement, PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Ms Warraich on her victory and thanked the people of Sialkot for reposing trust in the party.
The PP-52 seat had fallen vacant after the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich about two months ago.
Apparently for security reasons, the local administration had placed containers in front of the returning officer’s (RO) office – a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the RO’s office in Sambrial.
The local administration said the containers had been present outside the office since the start of the voting process and that the office wasn’t sealed after the polling.
PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, while speaking to media persons in Sambrial, said that polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
He said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said he wanted to bring the matter to the notice of the chief election commissioner, saying it was not tolerable that alleged rigging took place during the by-election.
Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
On the other hand, PTI leader Usman Dar alleged that the PTI voters, supporters and polling agents were expelled from different polling stations by the police to favour the ruling party’s candidate. Responding to the PTI and PPP allegations, Punjab Infor­mation Minister Azma Bukhari said that the people of Punjab had expressed full confidence in Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in the Sialkot by-poll held on Sunday.
In an apparent reference to the PPP, she said even the party that got 400 votes was complaining abo­ut rigging. In a jibe at the PTI, she said that those who use words like ‘deals and NRO as weapons’ were now seeking deals themselves.
In a presser in Islamabad, the PTI accused the Punjab government and police of interfering in the by-poll, claiming that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the by-election was rigged because the Punjab government was aware that it would not be able to win without manipulating the polling. He claimed that there were a large number of people in rallies and public meetings, due to which the Punjab government was sure that it stood no chance in the by-election.
“To win the election, PTI polling agents were forcefully removed from the polling stations, and then ballot papers were stamped and polled. Workers of the PML-N were allowed to remain in the polling stations, while our polling agents were told to leave. We have video evidence of all that,” he claimed.
Sheikh Waqqas alleged that pol­ice officials were openly supporting the PML-N workers and threatening the PTI workers. He alleged that workers of PTI, who refused to leave, were beaten and thrown out of polling stations. He clai­med that the helpline of the Elect­ion Comm­ission of Pakistan had become inaccessible during the polling.

• Trump’s envoy terms Hamas demand for changes to ceasefire proposal ‘unacceptable’
CAIRO: An Israeli attack near an aid distribution point in Gaza killed as many as 31 Palestinians on Sunday, local health authorities said.
The incident in Rafah is the latest in a series of Israeli attacks on aid delivery to Gaza, following the easing of an almost three-month Israeli blockade last month.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medical teams had recovered the bodies of 23 Palestinians and treated another 23 injured people near the aid collection site in Rafah.
Earlier, the Palestinian news agency WAFA put the number of deaths at 30.
Local health authorities said at least 31 bodies had so far arrived at Nasser Hospital.
Residents and medics said Israeli soldiers fired from the ground at a crane nearby that overlooks the area, and a tank opened fire at thousands of people who were en route to get aid from the site in Rafah.
Reuters footage showed ambulances carrying injured people to Nasser Hospital.
Israel’s military said in a statement it was looking into reports that Palestinians had been shot at an aid distribution site, but that it was unaware of injuries caused by military fire.
The US-based Gaza Humani­tarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid distribution sites in Rafah, denied anyone was killed or injured near its site in Rafah and that all of its distribution had taken place without incident.
But the Gaza government media office has accused Israel of turning the distribution sites into “death traps” for people seeking aid.
“We affirm to the world that what is taking place is a deliberate and malicious use of aid as a ‘weapon of war’, employed to exploit starving civilians and forcibly gather them at exposed killing zones, which are managed and monitored by the Israeli military,” it said.
Reda Abu Jazar said her brother was killed as he waited to collect food at an aid distribution centre in Rafah.
“Let them stop these massacres, stop this genocide. They are killing us,” she said, as Palestinian men gathered for funeral prayers.
The Red Crescent also reported that 14 more Palestinians were injured on Sunday by Israeli fire near a separate site in central Gaza.
Ceasefire talks falter
Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
 
 

Hamas said on Saturday it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable.”
On Sunday, dozens of Pales­tinians marched at the funeral of a Gaza doctor, Hamdi Al-Najjar, who was critically injured late in May in an air strike that killed all but one of his 10 children.
Najjar died late on Saturday.
“We could die any time, but we are still staying in our land, remaining to work to do our duty towards our people,” said Mohammed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals.
The Israeli military has confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Younis that day, but said it was targeting suspects in a structure that was close to Israeli soldiers.
The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the military had evacuated civilians from the area before the operation began.
Israel began its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as prisoners into Gaza.
Israel’s campaign has devastated much of Gaza, killing over 54,000 Palestinians and destroying most buildings.
Much of the population now lives in shelters in makeshift camps.

The call followed a rally by PM Narendra Modi in the opposition-ruled state, where CM Banerjee urged him not to exploit the sindoor, sacred to conservative Hindu women, to extract political benefit.
 
 

“You seem to be treating all Hindu women as your spouse,” CM Banerjee had said, asking the prime minister to apply the vermilion powder that depicts a woman’s married status to his wife.
Earlier, the chief minister had disallowed Yusuf Pathan, a former cricketer, from being included in the Indian squads traveling across the world to canvass support for India’s issues with Pakistan.

Amit Shah assails Mamata Banerjee over her criticism of Modi; calls for her ouster in next year’s polls

She had said it was the party’s prerogative to choose who should go. A bevy of Muslim men have been included in the diplomatic squads to showcase India’s secularism, des­c­r­i­bed as phony under Mr Modi’s watch.
On Sunday, Amit Shah launched a blistering attack on Ms Banerjee, accusing her of “stooping low” by opposing Operation Sindoor and the Waqf Amendment Act to appease the Muslim vote bank, and alleged that the Murshidabad riots were “state-sponsored”, The Hindu reported.
Addressing party leaders and workers in Kolkata, Mr Shah gave a clarion call to uproot the All India Trinamool Congress government from power in the 2026 assembly elections.
There is widespread belief that the uptick in conflict with Pakistan was timed to milk narrow nationalism for elections due in Bihar in October; that’s where Modi headed after the Pahalgam killings on April 22.
Ms Banerjee had recently accused the Centre of politicising Operation Sindoor for electoral gains.
Mr Shah alleged, without showing any evidence, that Pakistan-backed terrorists killed innocent citizens in front of their families after asking them about their religion.
Turning his attention to the Murshidabad violence that erupted during protests over the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, Mr Shah alleged that it was “state-sponsored”.
“The way a TMC minister incited the violence, it can be said that the Murshidabad riots were State-sponsored, which caused injustice to the Hindus…Mamata Banerjee’s minister abused the BSF, and the party’s leaders were standing there and encouraging the rioters,” he claimed.
“If BSF personnel had been deployed, Hindus would have been protected. It was only after BJP workers approached the high court that the BSF was finally sent in,” Mr Shah said.
The home minister also accused the ruling party of facilitating illegal cross-border movement from Bangladesh.
“The Bengal elections will not only decide the future of the State, but it is also linked to the security of the country. Mamata Banerjee has left Bengal’s borders open for Bangladeshis. Infiltration is taking place with her blessings. Only the BJP government can stop this,” he claimed.

• Hasina’s trial over ordering mass killings kicks off
• Top court overturns ban on Jamaat-i-Islami
DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday began issuing new banknotes removing images of its founding president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, whose trial on charges of orchestrating crimes against humanity also commenced in her absence.
The caretaker government, which has run the South Asian nation of some 170 million people since Ms Hasina fled last year, introduced the currency changes as it navigates a volatile political landscape.
Ms Hasina, 77, was overthrown in August 2024 following a student-led uprising.
“Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,” Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan said.
Until now, all notes featured the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971 and was assassinated in a 1975 coup.
New designs for the Muslim-majority nation include images of Hindu and Buddhist temples, historical palaces, artwork by the late painter Zainul Abedin depicting the Bengal famine, and the national martyrs’ memorial.
On Sunday, notes for three of the nine denominations were released. “The new notes will be issued from the central bank’s headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,” Khan added, noting that “other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases.” Existing notes and coins will remain legal tender.
This is not the first time banknote designs have reflected political shifts.
Initial 1972 notes featured a map, later replaced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s image during periods led by his Awami League party. When the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power, historic sites were featured.
‘Systematic attack’
Meanwhile, at the opening of Ms Hasina’s trial, prosecutors alleged she orchestrated a “systematic attack” to crush the uprising that toppled her.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 during her government’s crackdown, according to the United Nations.
Ms Hasina, in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an extradition order and rejected the charges as politically motivated.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures linked to Ms Hasina’s ousted government and her now-banned Awami League party.
“Upon scrutinising the evidence, we reached the conclusion that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” ICT chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told the court.
Mr Islam lodged five charges each against Ms Hasina, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun (in custody) and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal (on the run), including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder”.
‘Not an act of vendetta’
Prosecutor vowed impartiality, saying, “This is not an act of vendetta but a commitment to the principle that, in a democratic country, there is no room for crimes against humanity.”
Investigators have reportedly collected extensive evidence, including video footage and Ms Hasina’s phone conversations.
The prosecution alleged Ms Hasina ordered security forces to crush protesters, including directing them to open fire from helicopters, and specifically ordered the killing of student protester Abu Sayeed. They say such acts are tantamount to “crimes against humanity”.
The ICT court opened its first trial connected to Ms Hasina’s government on May 25. In that case, eight police officials face charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters on August 5, the day that Ms Hasina fled the country. Four of the officers are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
JI’s registration restored
On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-i-Islami, allowing it to participate in future elections.
The court overturned a 2013 high court order, initiated under Ms Hasina’s government, that had banned the party. “The Election Commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
The party’s lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system.” Ms Hasina had banned Jamaat-i-Islami, rivals of her father, and cracked down on its leaders. The Awami League itself was banned in May by the interim government, pending the outcome of trials against Hasina and other leaders.
