The remarks came as US news website Axios, citing two unidentified sources, reported that White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was planning to meet Iran’s foreign minister and chief negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, in Oslo next week.
Neither Tehran nor Washington confirmed the Axios report, which said a final date for the talks has yet to be set.
“We are for diplomacy,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi told NBC News, adding that the US should “convince us that they are not going to use military force while we are negotiating”.
“That is an essential element for our leadership to be in a position to decide about the future round of talks,” he added.
Tehran and Washington had held five rounds of nuclear talks since April 12 and were set to hold a new round two days before Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran on June 13.
 
 

The Israeli strikes targeted Iranian nuclear sites and killed several senior military officials and nuclear scientists.
On June 22, the US launched unprecedented strikes of its own on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz.
More than 900 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to the judiciary.
The Israeli attacks drew waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, killing 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
 
 

A ceasefire between Iran and Israel was agreed on June 24.
During the nuclear talks, which were stalled because of the fighting, Iran and the US had been at sharp odds over Iran’s uranium enrichment, which Tehran considers a “non-negotiable” right and which Washington has called a “red line”.
Iran has insisted on its right to enrich uranium even after the 12-day war with Israel.
“Our policy has not changed on enrichment,” Takht-Ravanchi told NBC News.
“Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory. The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarisation. “
At the same time, Iran affirmed its commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as it accused Germany of “malice” over its criticism of Tehran’s decision to suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.
“Iran remains committed to the NPT and its Safeguards Agreement,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.
“The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbours anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.
 






On Wednesday, Iran officially suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, citing the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
In a post on X, Germany’s foreign office called on Iran to “reverse this decision,” saying it sends a “devastating message”.
“It eliminates any possibility of international oversight of the Iranian nuclear programme, which is crucial for a diplomatic solution,” it added.
 






Araghchi lambasted what he called Germany’s “explicit support for Israel’s unlawful attack on Iran” on June 13, killing top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.
On June 17, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Israel was doing the “dirty work … for all of us” by targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/03200109f7be491.jpg?r=200939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921883/manga-doomsday-prediction-spooks-tourists-to-japan' target='_blank'><strong>Manga doomsday prediction spooks tourists to Japan</strong></a><br><p>Viral rumours of impending disaster stemming from a comic book prediction have taken the sheen off Japan’s tourism boom, with some airlines cancelling flights from Hong Kong where passenger numbers have plunged.
Japan has seen record numbers of visitors this year, with April setting an all-time monthly high of 3.9 million travellers.
That dipped in May, however, with arrivals from Hong Kong — the superstitious Chinese-controlled city where the rumours have circulated widely — down 11 per cent year-on-year, according to the latest data.
Steve Huen of Hong Kong-based travel agency EGL Tours blamed a flurry of social media predictions tied to a manga that depicts a dream of a massive earthquake and tsunami hitting Japan and neighbouring countries in July 2025.
“The rumours have had a significant impact,” said Huen, adding that his firm had seen its Japan-related business halve. Discounts and the introduction of earthquake insurance had “prevented Japan-bound travel from dropping to zero,” he added.
Branden Choi, a 28-year-old Hong Kong resident, said he was a frequent traveller to Japan but was hesitant to visit the country during July and August due to the manga prediction.
“If possible, I might delay my trip and go after September”, he said.
Ryo Tatsuki, the artist behind the manga titled The Future I Saw, first published in 1999 and then re-released in 2021, has tried to dampen the speculation, saying in a statement issued by her publisher that she was “not a prophet”.
The first edition of the manga warned of a major natural disaster in March 2011. That was the month and year when a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster struck Japan’s northeastern coast, killing thousands.
Some have interpreted the latest edition as predicting a catastrophic event specifically on July 5, 2025, although Tatsuki has denied this.
Situated within the Pacific Ocean’s ‘Ring of Fire’, Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent days, there have been more than 900 earthquakes, most of them small tremors, on islands off the southern tip of Kyushu.
But Robert Geller, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied seismology since 1971, said even scientifically-based earthquake prediction was “impossible”.
“None of the predictions I’ve experienced in my scientific career have come close at all,” he said.
Nevertheless, low-cost carrier Greater Bay Airlines became the latest Hong Kong airline on Wednesday to cancel flights to Japan due to low demand, saying it would indefinitely suspend its service to Tokushima in western Japan from September.
Serena Peng, 30, a visitor to Tokyo from Seattle, had initially tried to talk her husband out of visiting Japan after seeing the social media speculation.
“I’m not super worried right now, but I was before,” she said, speaking outside Tokyo’s bustling Senso-ji temple.
5.5-magnitude quake hits Japan island
Meanwhile, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.5 hit a remote island in southwestern Japan today, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
The earthquake’s epicentre was off the coast of the Tokara island chain in Kagoshima prefecture, nearly 1,200 kilometres from Tokyo, the agency said, adding that a tsunami warning had not been issued.
 






The quake hit at a depth of 20km, giving it a seismic intensity of ‘6 lower’ on Japan’s 1-7 scale on Akuseki Island, the agency said. Akuseki has a population of 89. The intensity is classified as a level that makes it “difficult to remain standing”, according to the agency.
More than 1,000 tremors with a seismic intensity of 1 or above on the Japanese scale have been detected around the island chain between June 21 and July 3, the agency said.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/03222706c7f6e4a.jpg?r=223312' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921891/putin-tells-trump-he-wont-back-down-from-goals-in-ukraine-kremlin-says' target='_blank'><strong>Putin tells Trump he won’t back down from goals in Ukraine, Kremlin says</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told United States President Donald Trump in a phone call on Thursday that Moscow wants a negotiated end to the Ukraine war, but will not step back from its original goals, a Kremlin aide said.
In a wide-ranging conversation that also covered Iran and the Middle East, Trump “again raised the issue of an early end to military action” in Ukraine, the aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters.
“Vladimir Putin, for his part, noted that we continue to seek a political and negotiated solution to the conflict,” Ushakov said.
Putin briefed Trump on the implementation of agreements reached between Russia and Ukraine last month to exchange prisoners-of-war and dead soldiers, Ushakov said, and told him that Moscow was ready to continue negotiations with Kyiv.
“Our president also said that Russia will achieve the goals it has set: that is, the elimination of the well-known root causes that led to the current state of affairs, to the current acute confrontation, and Russia will not back down from these goals,” he added.
There was nothing in the Kremlin readout to suggest that Putin had made any shift in Moscow’s position during the conversation with Trump, who took office with a promise to end the war swiftly but has voiced frequent frustration with the lack of progress between the two sides.
The phrase “root causes” is shorthand for the Kremlin’s argument that it was compelled to go to war in Ukraine to prevent the country from joining Nato and being used by the Western alliance as a launch pad to attack Russia.
Ukraine and its European allies say that is a specious pretext for what they call an imperial-style war, but Trump in previous public comments has shown sympathy with Moscow’s refusal to accept Nato membership for Ukraine.
Putin and Trump did not talk about the US decision to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine, Ushakov said.
On Iran, he said, “The Russian side emphasised the importance of resolving all disputes, disagreements and conflict situations exclusively by political and diplomatic means.”
Trump last month sent US stealth bombers to strike three Iranian nuclear sites, in a move condemned by Moscow as unprovoked and illegal.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/032211217168ad3.jpg?r=222038' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828/karachi-police-issue-traffic-plan-for-8-10th-muharram-processions' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police issue traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram processions</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) on Thursday issued a traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
The government today officially notified July 5 and July 6 (Saturday and Sunday) as public holidays on account of Ashura, both for offices observing a five and six-day working week.
 






According to the KTP plan, Muharram processions on all three days will depart Nishtar Park and culminate at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah after following their traditional fixed routes.
Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower.
The police broke down the procession routes as follows in a press release:

From Nazimabad Lasbela, Albela, right side Garden Jamaat Khana, Soldier Bazaar No 3 light signal to Numaish
From Liaquatabad, Tin Hatti, Jahangir Road, Guru Mandir to Numaish
From the Society light signal to Numaish
From Gulistan-i-Johar and Gulshan Iqbal, University Road, Old Sabzi Mandi, Kashmir Road and Society light signal to Numaish

Additionally, vehicles performing sabeel, niaz or tabarruk were instructed to enter the procession route at Tower/Memon Mosque.
Offering alternative routes for District Central, the press release said: “People coming from Nazimabad can proceed from Lasbela Chowk to Nishtar Road via Garden towards their destination.”
It said people coming from Liaquatabad could turn right from Tin Hatti to Lasbela Chowk and left to Central Jail via Martin Road.
“People going from Hassan Square to PP Chowrangi can go from Kashmir Road under the Jail Flyover to Society Light Signal (Shahrah-i-Quaideen) and from Jail Flyover to Tin Hatti to Nishtar Road (Lasbela Chowk).”
Outlining routes in District East, the KTP said, “People going from Sharea Faisal to Shahrah-i-Quaideen to Numaish can go from Society Light Signal to Kashmir Road to their destination.”
The press release added that citizens travelling from Central Jail Gate along Jamshed Road to Gurumandir on MA Jinnah Road could go from Gurumandir to Bahadur Yar Jang Road, then on Soldier Bazaar to their destination.
“People going from Garden Zoo to MA Jinnah Road can go to their destination from Uncle Saria, Gul Plaza on the right and Coast Guard Holy Family Hospital on the left,” the press release reads.
The KTP said that heavy traffic going from Super Highway and Gulberg towards MA Jinnah Road would be diverted from Liaquatabad to Nazimabad Chowrangi, travelling via the Habib Bank Flyover to State Avenue Road, Shershah and Maripur.
“The same route will be taken for the return journey,” the police said.
“All heavy or commercial traffic coming from the National Highway towards the city, whether via Sharea Faisal or Rashid Minhas Road, Stadium Road, Sir Shah Suleman Road, Hassan Square, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad Chowrangi, the Habib Bank Flyover, State Avenue Road, or Shershah will be allowed to come to Maripur and the same route will be used for return journeys.”
The press release stated that no traffic would be allowed onto MA Jinnah Road beyond Gurumandir Chowk, unless the vehicle had a sticker to join the procession.
“Vehicles with stickers to join the procession will be allowed to enter via the Shahrah-i-Qaideen Society light signal,” the press release reads.
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon asserted that the provincial government has adopted foolproof security arrangements for Muharram, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Memon announced that a total of 49,662 police personnel will be deployed in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad from Muharram 8 to 10 to prevent any untoward incidents.
He noted that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah held meetings with various religious scholars and reviewed the security plan for gatherings and processions.
Providing a breakdown of the security plan, Memon said 14,546 police personnel will be deployed for gatherings and 35,116 for Muharram processions, with over 14,000 additional personnel assigned to ensure the security of all events.
 






For Muharram, Islamabad police have identified 13 points as potential trouble spots, banned the entry of 17 “firebrand” ulema and increased intelligence operations.
 
 

While the Punjab government has imposed certain restrictions under Section 144 across the province till Sunday, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration has limited it to sensitive districts. In Karachi, over 20,000 officers and personnel have been deployed till Ashura.
Naqvi meets religious scholars, stresses role in ensuring peace
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stressed the crucial role of religious scholars in ensuring peace during Muharram.
“It is not enough how much we thank you for your role — the heads and ulema of all sects — in Muharram, as everyone has a role in this,” Naqvi said as he met with scholars from various schools of thought in Islamabad.
 






Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad, chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, were also present during the meeting.
Naqvi highlighted that the efforts of law enforcement agencies during Muharram were as important as those of religious scholars, according to a post on X by the interior ministry.
During the meeting, Naqvi noted that ulema remained in “constant communication” with the administration during Muharram and “solved minor disputes”.
He requested Maulana Azad, as well as other scholars, to collectively offer Zuhr prayers at Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque on August 14. “This will give a message to the whole world that we are all united, and there is no better day than the 14th of August.”
Chaudhry also credited religious scholars for dealing with terrorism, sectarianism, and maintaining peace during the month of Muharram.
On his part, Maulana Azad affirmed that they all were united for the country’s security.
Speaking about the uptick in terrorism in KP, Naqvi called on the ulema to engage with religious scholars in the province, offering his cooperation in the matter.
“This terrorism will only end on the condition that the locals there do not help them,” he said.
 






The interior minister’s remarks come just a day after an assistant commissioner and four others were martyred, while policemen were among 17 others injured as an official vehicle was targeted in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.
During the meeting, Naqvi also highlighted the role of the armed forces in the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire, saying Pakistan should be proud of “convincing world leaders” and of playing its role as a Muslim country.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries.
83 arrested across Punjab in 4 days for ‘hateful content’
Separately, the Punjab Police said today they had registered 72 cases and arrested 83 individuals over the past four days for sharing “objectionable” content on social media.
Providing the details of the past 24 hours on X, the police said 20 cases had been filed and 24 had been taken into custody for uploading “objectionable and hateful content” on social media platforms.
It warned the public that strict action would be taken against those spreading “sectarian, hateful or inflammatory content” on social media.
 






The Punjab Home Department also said it reported 932 social media accounts to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for spreading inciteful content.
“The Home Department’s Cyber Patrolling and Quick Response Cell is functioning 24/7, and is monitoring and taking immediate action against sectarian, inciteful and religious hatred-based content,” the department said on X.

Romania has a brown bear population of 10,000 to 13,000, preliminary results of a multi-year DNA study showed this year, and authorities are struggling to keep residents and tourists in mountain towns safe.
Police and emergency services said in a joint statement that tourists had alerted them to Thursday’s attack on the Transfagarasan road in the central county of Arges. The bear had dragged the motorcyclist down a ravine, they said.
There were no details about the motorcyclist’s identity.
Almost 30 people have been killed by bears in Romania over the last two decades, the environment ministry has said. Sightings of bears are common and local media regularly report bear attacks on people and livestock.
Last year, Romania’s parliament doubled the annual bear kill quota to 481 bear kills per year to control the size of the bear population and to remove animals that have become accustomed to entering cities in search of food.
Wildlife experts have said bear attacks have increased because of human behaviour as the shrinking of the animals’ habitats due to construction, logging and climate change.
Many bears are also attracted by rubbish dumps on the outskirts of cities and by discarded food. Officials have not done enough to step up prevention measures, including electric fences and better trash management, wildlife experts said.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612262-ttap-chief-achakzai-offers-pm-talks-on-unity-govt' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP chief Achakzai offers PM talks on unity govt</strong></a><br><p>

In April, Kaspersky — a cybersecurity company that provides antivirus and other security software for computers and mobile devices — said that widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies in recent years has provided “threat actors with sophisticated new tools to perpetrate attacks”.
In a press release issued today, Kaspersky said that based on the “unique malicious and unwanted files” observed, the most common lures for the cyberattacks included Zoom and Microsoft Office, with newer AI-based services such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek being increasingly exploited by attackers.
It said its analysts explored how frequently malicious and unwanted software was disguised as legitimate applications commonly used by SMBs, using a sample of 12 online productivity apps.
“In total, Kaspersky observed more than 4,000 unique malicious and unwanted files disguised as popular apps in 2025. With the growing popularity of AI services, cybercriminals are increasingly disguising malware as AI tools.
“The number of cyberthreats mimicking ChatGPT increased by 115 per cent in the first four months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, reaching 177 unique malicious and unwanted files. Another popular AI tool, DeepSeek, accounted for 83 files. This large language model launched in 2025 immediately appeared on the list of impersonated tools.”
 
 

Vasily Kolesnikov, security expert at Kaspersky, noted that threat actors were rather selective in choosing an AI tool as bait.
“The likelihood that an attacker will use a tool as a disguise for malware or other types of unwanted software directly depends on the service’s popularity and hype around it.”
He added that the more publicity and conversation there was around a tool, the more likely a user would come across a fake package on the internet.
Kolesnikov warned SMB employees to exercise caution when looking for software on the internet or when they encountered “too-good-to-be-true” subscription deals, advising them to check the correct spellings of the websites and links in suspicious emails.
“In many cases, these links may turn out to be phishing or a link that downloads malicious or potentially unwanted software,” he added.
The firm also warned about the growing use of collaboration platform brands to trick users into downloading or launching malware.
“The number of malicious and unwanted software files disguised as Zoom increased by nearly 13pc in 2025, reaching 1,652, while such names as ‘Microsoft Teams’ and ‘Google Drive’ saw increases of 100pc and 12pc, respectively, with 206 and 132 cases,” it said, noting that the pattern likely reflected the normalisation of remote work and geographically distributed teams, which has made these platforms integral to business operations across industries.
The firm said that among the analysed sample, the highest number of files mimicked Zoom, accounting for nearly 41pc of all unique files detected. Of Microsoft Office applications being mimicked, Outlook and PowerPoint each accounted for 16pc, Excel for nearly 12pc, while Word and Teams made up 9pc and 5pc, respectively.
It added that downloaders, trojans and adware were among the top threats targeting SMBs in 2025.
“Apart from malware threats, Kaspersky continues to observe a wide range of phishing and scam schemes targeting SMBs. Attackers aim to steal login credentials for various services — from delivery platforms to banking systems — or manipulate victims into sending them money through deceptive tactics. One example is a phishing attempt targeting Google Accounts. Attackers promise potential victims to increase sales by advertising their company on X, with the ultimate goal of stealing their credentials.
“Beyond phishing, SMBs are flooded with spam emails. Not surprisingly, AI has also made its way into the spam folder — for example, with offers for automating various business processes.”
The firm concluded by advising owners and employees of SMBs to use specialised cybersecurity solutions to mitigate threats, define access rules for corporate resources such as shared folders and documents, and back up important data regularly.
It also recommended establishing clear guidelines for using external services and creating well-defined procedures to implement new software.</p><small>2025-07-03 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031839014718436.jpg?r=193243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921867/pakistans-participation-in-hockey-tournaments-hosted-by-india-undecided-psb' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s participation in hockey tournaments hosted by India undecided: PSB</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Sports Board said on Wednesday that the hockey team’s participation in the 2025 Men’s Hockey Asia Cup and the Federation of International Hockey (FIH) Junior Men’s Cup — both hosted by India — remained unconfirmed.
Earlier today, Indian media outlets reported that Pakistan had been cleared to take part in both events, scheduled from August 27 to September 7, and from November 28 to December 10, respectively.
In exclusive comments to Dawn.com, Pakistan Sports Board spokesperson Khurram Shahzad said that the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) issued a request about whether or not the national hockey team can travel to India to play in the Asia Cup, amid spiking tensions between the two nations.
“On June 19, the Pakistan Sports Board sent this request to the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a final decision,” Shahzad said.
“However, no decision has been taken on this yet.”
Shahzad noted in his comments that the Asia Cup is a qualifying event for the 2026 Hockey World Cup.
According to The Times of India, the Indian interior and foreign ministries have cleared Pakistan’s participation in the tournaments, with the visa process underway.
The outlet reported that the choice to allow Pakistan to take part was “part of the Indian government’s efforts to keep politics and sports aside”, in keeping with the Olympic Charter.
However, The Times of India noted that if Pakistan had been disallowed from the tournament, India would face sanctions from the International Olympic Committee. Additionally, it reported that the decision meant that Pakistani athletes in other sports would be able to compete in India.
Political tensions between the two nations have cast a shadow over bilateral sporting events.
India will host the women’s 50-over World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.</p><small>2025-07-03 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612246-sindhs-number-plate-drive-fuels-fines-public-anger-processing-delays' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh's number plate drive fuels fines, public anger, processing delays</strong></a><br><p>

On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An Anti-Terrorism Court in Islamabad had sentenced PTI MNA Abdul Latif and 11 other party members were convicted under various charges on May 30  for attacking the Ramna police station in Islamabad.
Following the verdict, the police took the four of the convicted members present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody.
During today’s hearing, Justice Azam Khan and Justice Khadim Soomro acquitted the four convicts after the prosecution was unable to prove their presence at the scene of the protest based on the witnesses’ accounts.
The convicts had been charged under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing official duty), 188 (disobeying order of a public servant), 324 (attempted mu­r­der), 353 (assault on public servants), 436 (arson) and 440 (misch­ief); Sect­ion 144 of CrPC; and Sec­tion 7 of the Anti Terro­rism Act (ATA), 1997.
They were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment under Section 7 ATA, five years under Section 324 of PPC, four under Section 436, two each under sections 353 and 148.
Additionally, the convicts were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.
A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).
The sentences were to run concurrently.
The hearing
PTI lawyer Babar Awan argued that out of the nine prosecution witnesses, only one witness — Assistant Sub-Inspector Muhammad Sharif — was able to identify the accused.
He said, “While it was alleged that the protesters had resorted to firing, no one was injured. The crime must be punished, but the system should not be made into a joke.”
Justice Soomro asked the prosecutor, Nasir Shah, to present the evidence. Shah said that the evidence had been collected but sought more time to present it before the court.
The bench said that if more time was required, then it should have been informed in advance, since now it had heard all the arguments.
It further said that no one was injured, adding that the prosecution should prove the presence of the accused at the scene.
The judges said that the witnesses’ statements did not include any mention that the accused were present at the scene. They questioned whether the court would now hand down sentences based on an identity parade.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor said, “What could be a greater act of terrorism than an attack on a police station?”</p><small>2025-07-03 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031824564b147a0.jpg?r=183025' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921869/pm-arrives-in-azerbaijan-to-attend-17th-eco-summit' target='_blank'><strong>PM arrives in Azerbaijan to attend 17th ECO Summit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Azerbaijan on Thursday to participate in the 17th Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO).
The summit is set to run from July 3–4 in Khankendi, convening ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, ECO observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the prime minister during the two-day visit.
The delegation arrived in the city of Shusha for a two-day visit, where it was received by Azerbaijan’s Minister for Culture Adil Karimli, at Fuzuli Airport.
 






Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other senior diplomatic and government officials were also present to welcome the delegation.
 






In a statement ahead of the visit, the Foreign Office had said the prime minister would “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.
The theme of the summit is ‘New ECO Vision for a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Future’.
According to a statement by ECO, the summit will convene ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.
The summit will feature a “dynamic and inclusive ECO Week”, held from July 1–4 across multiple cities in Azerbaijan. The ECO week will include a series of thematic forums aimed at advancing youth engagement, gender inclusion and economic connectivity within the region.
The 16th ECO summit was held from November 9, 2023, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and attended by then-caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar.</p><small>2025-07-03 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031755126df5654.jpg?r=175555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921839/trump-tax-bill-stalled-by-republican-rebellion-in-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Trump tax bill stalled by Republican rebellion in Congress</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill was in limbo early Thursday as Republican leaders in the US Congress scrambled to win over a group of rebels threatening to torpedo the centrepiece of the president’s domestic agenda.
Trump is seeking final approval in the House of Representatives for his Senate-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” — but faces opposition on all sides of his fractious party over provisions set to balloon the national debt while launching a historic assault on the social safety net.
As midnight (9am PKT) struck, House Speaker Mike Johnson was still holding open a key procedural vote — the bill’s last hurdle before it can advance to be considered for final approval — more than two hours after it was first called.
With no clear sign of the stalemate breaking, his lieutenants huddled in tense meetings behind the scenes with the rebels who had either voted no or had yet to come to the House floor.
“We’re going to get there tonight. We’re working on it and very, very positive about our progress,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol, according to Politico.
Originally approved by the House in May, Trump’s sprawling legislation squeezed through the Senate on Tuesday by a solitary vote but had to return to the lower chamber on Wednesday for a rubber stamp of the Senate’s revisions.
The package honours many of Trump’s campaign promises, boosting military spending, funding a mass migrant deportation drive and committing $4.5 trillion to extend his first-term tax relief.
 
 

But it is expected to pile an extra $3.4tr over a decade onto the country’s fast-growing deficits, while forcing through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance programme since its 1960s launch.
While moderates in the House are anxious that the cuts will damage their prospects of re-election, fiscal hawks are chafing over savings that they say fall short of what they were promised by hundreds of billions of dollars.
Johnson has to negotiate incredibly tight margins, and can likely only lose three lawmakers among more than two dozen who have declared themselves open to rejecting Trump’s bill.
 


‘Abomination’
Republican leaders had been hoping to spend just a few hours on Wednesday afternoon green-lighting the package, although they had a cushion of two days before Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.
The 887-page text only passed in the Senate after a flurry of tweaks that pulled the House-passed text further to the right.
 
 

Republicans lost one conservative who was angry about adding to the country’s $37tr debt burden and two moderates worried about almost $1tr in health care cuts.
Some estimates put the total number of recipients set to lose their health insurance at $17 million, while scores of rural hospitals are expected to close.
Legislation in the House has to go through multiple “test” votes before it can come up for final approval, and a majority must wave it through at each of these stages.
There were warning signs early in the day as the package stumbled at one of the first steps, with a straightforward vote that ought to have taken minutes remaining open for seven hours and 31 minutes — making it the longest House vote in history.
Johnson had made clear that he was banking on Trump leaning on waverers, as he has in the past to turn around contentious House votes that were headed for failure.
The president has spent weeks cajoling Republicans torn between angering welfare recipients at home and incurring his wrath.
Trump pressured House Republicans to get the bill over the line in a private White House meeting with several holdouts on Wednesday.
“What are the Republicans waiting for?” he posted on his Truth Social platform just after midnight.
“What are you trying to prove??? MAGA is not happy, and it’s costing you votes!!!”
 


House Democrats have signalled that they plan to campaign on the bill to flip the chamber in the 2026 midterm elections, pointing to analyses showing that it represents a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest Americans to the richest.
“Shame on Senate Republicans for passing this disgusting abomination,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters.</p><small>2025-07-03 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031743575fae465.png?r=175122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921866/japan-plans-world-first-deep-sea-mineral-extraction' target='_blank'><strong>Japan plans ‘world first’ deep-sea mineral extraction</strong></a><br><p>Japan will from January attempt to extract rare earth minerals from the ocean floor in the deepest trial of its kind, the director of a government innovation programme said on Thursday.
Earlier this week, the country pledged to work with the United States, India and Australia to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals, as concern grows over China’s dominance in resources vital to new technologies.
Rare earths — 17 metals difficult to extract from the Earth’s crust — are used in everything from electric vehicles to hard drives, wind turbines and missiles.
China accounts for almost two-thirds of rare earth mining production and 92 per cent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.
A Japanese deep-sea scientific drilling boat called the Chikyu will from January conduct a “test cruise” to retrieve ocean floor sediments that contain rare earth elements, said Shoichi Ishii, director of Japan’s Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Programme.
“The test to retrieve the sediments from 5,500 metres water depth is the first in the world,” he told AFP.
“Our goal … of this cruise is to test the function of all mining equipment,” so the amount of sediment extracted “doesn’t matter at all”, Ishii added.
The Chikyu will drill in Japanese economic waters around the remote island of Minami Torishima in the Pacific — the easternmost point of Japan, also used as a military base.
Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported that the mission aims to extract 35 tonnes of mud from the sea floor over around three weeks.
Each tonne is expected to contain around two kilogrammes of rare earth minerals, which are often used to make magnets that are essential in modern electronics.
Deep-sea mining has become a geopolitical flashpoint, with anxiety growing over a push by US President Donald Trump to fast-track the practice in international waters.
 
 

Beijing has since April required licences to export rare earths from China, a move seen as retaliation for US curbs on the import of Chinese goods.
Environmental campaigners warn that deep-sea mining threatens marine ecosystems and will disrupt the sea floor.
The International Seabed Authority, which has jurisdiction over the ocean floor outside national waters, is meeting later this month to discuss a global code to regulate mining in the ocean depths.</p><small>2025-07-03 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0313561259e87d2.png?r=135821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921844/liverpools-portuguese-forward-diogo-jota-dies-in-car-crash-in-spain-report' target='_blank'><strong>Liverpool’s Portuguese forward Diogo Jota dies in car crash in Spain: report</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool’s Portuguese forward Diogo Jota, 28, died in a fiery car crash near Zamora in northwestern Spain with his brother, Spanish state-owned TV station TVE said on Thursday, citing local firefighters.
Police told Reuters everything pointed to that information being correct, although they could not yet officially confirm the names.
The regional fire department of Castille-Leon, where Zamora is located, said on its website a car crashed shortly after midnight on Thursday and burst into flames, with two men, aged 28 and 26, found dead.

Liverpool Football Club said it was “devastated by the tragic passing of Jota”.
“The club have been informed the 28-year-old has passed away following a road traffic accident in Spain along with his brother, Andre,” it said on social media.
“Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre’s family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss.
“We will continue to provide them with our full support,” the club said.
Jota, who got married on June 28, helped Liverpool win the Premier League last season and also won the Football Association Challenge (FA) Cup and League Cup with the Merseyside outfit.
Jota arrived at Anfield from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club in all competitions.
He also made 49 appearances for Portugal, twice winning the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Nations League.
Jota will be honoured by a moment’s silence before Portugal’s match against Spain at the Women’s Euro 2025 tournament, UEFA said.
“A moment of silence will be observed at all of today’s (Thursday’s) and tomorrow’s UEFA Women’s Euro 2025 matches in memory of Portugal international and Liverpool FC forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva who tragically passed away today,” UEFA said.
 






Portugal face Spain in Group B in Switzerland after Italy and Belgium face off in Sion, with the latter match the first to kick off after the tribute to Jota.
Condolences pour in
Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the news of the death of Jota, “an athlete who greatly honoured Portugal’s name, and his brother is unexpected and tragic”.
“I extend my deepest condolences to their family. It is a sad day for football and for national and international sports.”
 






The Portuguese Football Federation said the entire Portuguese football community was devastated by the deaths of Jota and Andre.
“Diogo Jota was not only a fantastic player with almost 50 caps for the national team, but also an extraordinary person who was respected by all his teammates and opponents.
“He had a contagious joy and was a reference point in his own community […] We have lost two champions. Their deaths represent irreparable losses for Portuguese football, and we will do everything we can to honour their legacy every day.”
Former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher said: “Devastating news about Diogo Jota and his brother Andre this morning. Thoughts are with everyone of their family and friends, especially his wife Rute and their three lovely kids.”
 






Portugal and Al-Hilal Midfielder Ruben Neves said: “They say that we only lose people when we forget them. I will never forget you.”
FC Porto said, “FC Porto is in mourning. It is with shock and deep regret that we send our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva, who was also our athlete in the youth ranks.
“Rest in peace.”
 






Sporting CP said: “The world of football is poorer. Sporting CP expresses its sorrow at the death of Portuguese international Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva. Our deepest condolences go out to the whole family at this difficult time.”

However, no such development occurred.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping comprising members such as China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held on June 26 as a precursor to the annual summit of their leaders set for the autumn.
The defence ministers attending the SCO meeting failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal because of what it said was “a lack of consensus on referring to ‘terrorism’”.
Russia and India are close allies with significant military and defence interests, while the former’s relationship with Pakistan has seen significant growth in recent years.
On Sunday, digital news outlet The Daily CPEC shared a post on X that read: “Breaking: Russia has officially signed the joint SCO statement, supporting Pakistan’s position over India.”
It was viewed by 915,000 users.
Former Indian soldier and journalist Pravin Sawhney also quoted the post with the following caption: “This is a sure signal of where regional geopolitics is moving. Pakistan’s profile is on the rise!” racking up 563,000 views.
The claim was extensively shared by multiple users on X, here, here, and here, gaining 297,000, 159,000, and 80,000 views, respectively.
Other shares of the viral claim could be found here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in Pakistan’s regional position following the conflict with India earlier in May.
A keyword search for “Russia” and “SCO summit” yielded no relevant news stories from credible international media outlets or Chinese state news outlets that corroborated the alleged development.
As per the claims, Russia had officially signed the joint statement; however, checking Russian media outlets, including TASS, Russia Today, and Sputnik, yielded no announcement, press release or report to this effect.
All reported news coverage around the June 26 defence ministers’ meeting, such as by British outlet BBC and international wire news agency Reuters, was solely on India’s refusal to sign a joint statement at the summit over concerns the document was biased towards Pakistan for not mentioning April’s terror attack on Indian tourists, which subsequently led to the lack of any joint statement being issued.
Since then, there has been no other SCO-related development where member states have signed any statement.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that Russia officially signed the SCO summit statement in favour of Pakistan is false.  No statement was issued after the June 26 SCO defence ministers’ meeting and no such development has occurred or been reported by credible media outlets or state news outlets.

“During the meeting, both sides held discussions on [a] wide range of areas of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press statement.
“The dignitaries discussed practical measures to further expand the level and scope of engagements between the two militaries. They also exchanged views on the broader geopolitical landscape.”
Gen Mirza, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, shared Pakistan’s perspective on the evolving regional security landscape and highlighted Pakistan’s contributions towards regional peace and stability, the ISPR added.
The visiting dignitary lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
Upon arrival at the Joint Staff Headquarters, a smartly turned out tri-services contingent presented a guard of honour to Lt Gen Mbambo.
 


Meeting with PAF chief
A day earlier, the SAAF chief called on Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, at Air Headquarters in Islamabad.
During the meeting, Chief of Air Staff Sidhu “emphasised the shared values and aspirations that form the foundation of the deep-rooted friendship between Pakistan and South Africa”.
He reiterated PAF’s commitment to bolster SAAF’s aerial combat capabilities through tailored training and capacity-building initiatives.
Lt Gen Mbambo lauded PAF’s robust operational readiness, its multi-domain warfare capabilities and its success in maintaining a credible deterrence posture.
The South African air chief articulated a strong desire to further strengthen and institutionalise the formal relationship between the SAAF and the PAF.
The discussions centred on revamping SAAF’s training regime. Lt Gen Mbambo sought the PAF’s support in developing a modern and comprehensive training framework, commencing at the academy level.
He also expressed his earnest desire for SAAF officers’ participation as observers in PAF’s major operational exercises.
Acknowledging the technical excellence and cost-effective maintenance capabilities offered by PAF’s engineering infrastructure, Lt Gen Mbambo also conveyed SAAF’s intent to undertake the inspection and maintenance of its C-130 fleet in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-03 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612214-pti-to-file-reference-against-four-mnas-who-joined-pml-n' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to file reference against four MNAs who joined PML-N: Qaiser</strong></a><br><p>

Dhaka is proposing to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump used as the reason for imposing painful levies in his “Liberation Day” announcement.
“We have finalised a draft reciprocal trade agreement,” Mahbubur Rahman said on Wednesday, adding the government was “hopeful of reaching a win-win agreement”.
Rahman said a meeting between officials from both countries was slated for July 8, with the US representing 20 per cent of Bangladesh’s ready-made garments exports.
Textile and garment production accounts for about 8pc of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.
Trump hit Bangladesh with 37pc tariffs in his April 2 announcement, which is more than double the 16pc already placed on cotton products.
He suspended the tolls’ introduction until July 9, as he did with other global trading partners, though a baseline 10pc levy was kept in place.
Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21bn, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.
“As part of the initiative to reduce the trade gap, the government already decided to import a large volume of wheat, purchasing 14 aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, buying cotton and more oil and gas from the US farms,” Rahman said.
He did not give further details on the exact timing or extent of the proposed deals, but said the government had held around 28 meetings and document exchanges in a bid to reach an agreement.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus spoke to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday and told him Dhaka was “working with your officials to finalise a package of measures to effectively respond to President Trump’s trade agenda”.
 






Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national platform of the garment makers, expressed concerns about any deal.
“The already enacted additional 10pc tariff is hitting our exporters, and if it goes further, we might lose US buyers,” he warned.
But Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), told AFP he was optimistic.
“We are hopeful of a positive outcome on the US tariff before July 9,” he said.
“There will be a temporary problem if the US administration does not revise the tariff. But it will largely and ultimately hit the US buyers, as they would have to buy goods at higher prices.”</p><small>2025-07-03 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0312480841b3ea9.png?r=124912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921834/pakistan-dominates-squash-courts-as-5-players-storm-into-asian-junior-semis' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dominates squash courts as 5 players storm into Asian junior semis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan dominated the squash courts on Thursday as five players stormed into the semi-finals of the 32nd Asian Junior Individual Squash Championships in Gimcheon, South Korea.

Last year, half a million devotees took part in the Amarnath pilgrimage to a sacred ice pillar located in a cave in the forested Himalayan hills above the town of Pahalgam.
India has ramped up security for the event, deploying 45,000 troops with high-tech surveillance tools overseeing the gruelling trek to reach the high-altitude cave, dedicated to the Hindu deity of destruction Shiva.
“We have multi-layered and in-depth security arrangements so that we can make the pilgrimage safe and smooth for the devotees,” said VK Birdi, police chief for the Muslim-majority territory.
Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down six Indian jets after they bombed sites across the border, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.
It was the worst standoff by the nuclear-armed nations since 1999, with more than 70 people killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides.
But pilgrim Muneshwar Das Shashtri, who travelled from Uttar Pradesh state, told AFP that “there is no fear of any kind”.
“Our army is standing guard everywhere. No one can raise a finger towards us,” he said.

‘Not afraid’
At Pahalgam, soldiers have turned a tented base camp into a fortress encircled by razor wire.
Troops in newly deployed armoured cars, or from gun positions behind sandbags, keep a close watch — efforts boosted by facial recognition cameras.
“High-quality surveillance cameras have been installed at all major points along the route,” said Manoj Sinha, the Indian-appointed top administrator for occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
All pilgrims must be registered and travel in guarded vehicle convoys, until they start out to walk.
Camouflaged bunkers have been erected in the forests along the route, where dozens of makeshift kitchens provide free food.
Electronic radio cards pinpoint their location.
Pilgrims can take several days to reach the cave, perched at 3,900 metres high, around 30 kilometres uphill from the last easily motorable track.

“Whatever the attack that was carried out here, I am not afraid. I have come to get a glimpse of baba (the ice formation)” said Ujwal Yadav, aged 29, from India’s Uttar Pradesh state, undertaking his first pilgrimage to the shrine.
“Such are the security arrangements here that no one can be hurt.”
Sinha has said that “public confidence is returning”, but admits that pilgrim registration had dipped by 10 per cent this year.
Once a modest, little-known ritual, attended by only a few thousand mainly local devotees, the pilgrimage has grown since the Kashmiris’ uprising erupted in 1989.
India’s government has since heavily promoted the annual event, which runs until August 9.
Those fighting against India’s occupation of Kashmir have said the pilgrimage is not a target, but have warned they would act if it was used to assert Hindu dominance.
In 2017, suspected militants attacked a pilgrim bus, killing 11 people.
The gunmen who carried out the April 22 killings remain at large, despite the manhunt by security forces in IoK, where India has half a million soldiers permanently deployed.
On June 22, India’s National Investigation Agency claimed two men had been arrested from the Pahalgam area, who they said had allegedly “provided food, shelter and logistical support” to the gunmen.
Indian police have issued wanted notices for three of the gunmen, two of whom they claimed were Pakistani citizens.</p><small>2025-07-03 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612161-three-spells-of-rain-likely-in-karachi-this-month' target='_blank'><strong>Three spells of rain likely in Karachi this month</strong></a><br><p>

Rescuers were racing to find 30 people still missing at sea after the vessel carrying 65 passengers and crew sank before midnight on Wednesday as it sailed to the popular holiday destination from Indonesia’s main island Java.
“The ferry tilted and immediately sank,” survivor Eka Toniansyah told reporters at a Bali hospital.
“Most of the passengers were from Indonesia. I was with my father. My father is dead.”
Indonesia’s national search and rescue agency chief Mohammad Syafii told a news conference on Thursday that 31 survivors had been found.
“Four people died, so 30 people are still being searched for,” he said, adding the national agency sent a helicopter to help the effort.
President Prabowo Subianto, who was on a trip to Saudi Arabia, ordered an immediate emergency response, cabinet secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya said in a statement on Thursday, adding the cause of the accident was “bad weather”.
Java-based Surabaya search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit, who had earlier put the total number of missing at 38, said efforts to reach the doomed vessel were initially hampered by adverse weather conditions.
 


Waves as high as 2.5 metres with “strong winds and strong currents” had affected the rescue operation, he said, adding conditions have since improved.
A rescue team of at least 54 personnel including from the navy and police were dispatched along with inflatable rescue boats, he said, while a bigger vessel was later sent from Surabaya city to assist the search efforts.
Following currents
Nanang said rescuers would follow currents and expand the search area if there were still unaccounted for people by the end of the day.
“For today’s search, we are still focusing on search above the water where initial victims were found,” the Surabaya search and rescue chief said.
The ferry’s manifest showed 53 passengers and 12 crew members, he said, but rescuers were still assessing if there were more people onboard than the manifest showed.
It is common in Indonesia for the actual number of passengers on a boat to differ from the manifest.

Frequent accidents
The ferry crossing from Ketapang port in Java’s Banyuwangi regency to Bali’s Gilimanuk port — one of the busiest in Indonesia — is around 5 kilometres as the crow flies and takes around one hour.
It is often used by people crossing between the islands by car.
Four of the known survivors saved themselves by using the ferry’s lifeboat and were found in the water early Thursday, the Surabaya rescue agency said.
It said the ferry was also transporting 22 vehicles, including 14 trucks. It was unclear if any foreigners were onboard when the ferry sank.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards and sometimes due to bad weather.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
A ferry carrying more than 800 people ran aground in shallow waters off East Nusa Tenggara province in 2022 and remained stuck for two days before being dislodged with no one hurt.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra island.</p><small>2025-07-03 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031028597f75ec6.jpg?r=102905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921711/probe-ordered-into-abduction-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girl-in-badin' target='_blank'><strong>Probe ordered into ‘abduction, forced conversion’ of Hindu girl in Badin</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD/ KARACHI: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken a notice of a case involving the alleged abduction, child marriage, and forced conversion of a 15-year-old Hindu girl in Matli in the Badin district.
According to reports circulating on social media, a ninth-grade student was allegedly abducted at gunpoint near Notkani Chowk in Matli. A complaint filed by her uncle, Majno Maharaj, at the Matli police station alleges that two armed men — Maqsood Dars and Manzoor Dars — forcibly entered the family’s home and abducted the girl, Shahneela, while two unidentified men waited outside in a white vehicle used for the abduction.
The victim’s family has expressed the fear that the girl is at imminent risk of being forcibly married to someone and converted — both of which are violations of the country’s law.
The suspect’s family has allegedly refused to return the girl despite the family’s appeals, it was stated.

SHRC urges law enforcers to ensure safety and recovery of 15-year-old

The SHRC has cited several legal provisions that criminalise the actions allegedly taken by the suspects.
It stated that Sections 365-B, 364-A, and 506 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) prohibit abduction, forced marriage, and threats. Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees religious freedom, rendering forced conversions unconstitutional.
The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and its associated Rules (2016) empower law enforcers to intervene in such cases, it said.
 
 

Specifically, Rule 8 mandates the rescue and recovery of child victims while Rule 9 authorises search warrants for missing children, it added.
Rule 10 provides for the temporary custody of rescued minors. Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows police to act pre-emptively in cognizable offenses.
Expressing grave concern, the SHRC highlighted the increasing number of cases involving child marriages and forced conversions among Hindu minorities in Sindh.
The commission described these incidents as serious violations of child rights, minority protections, and constitutional guarantees.
Under its powers vested by Section 4 (i) (ii) of the Sindh Protection of Human Rights Act, 2011, the SHRC has directed the authorities concerned to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a report through a competent officer before the Commission by July 7, 2025, at 11am.

The police acted when the suspects blatantly violated the Section 144 imposed by the Punjab government to ensure peace in the city during Muharram.
As per CCD sources, TikToker Kashif Zamir, along with his armed bodyguards, traveled on a city road in a double-cabin vehicle. His team recorded video clips showing the weapons displayed by his guards and uploaded the same on social media.
The police say such conduct causes harassment to the public.
A CCD official says the police arrested the TikToker in a raid and recovered firearms from him and his guards, lodging cases against them.
He says the police also recovered videos of the TikToker showing him traveling on different city roads, along with his heavily-armed security guards. The CCD official says that Kashif Zameer is a habitual offender as he was also arrested in the past on the same charges.
Later, a video statement of the TikToker, recorded in police custody, appeared on social media wherein he apologised for taking law into his hands.

Now, women will be able to get promotions and higher posts after changing their domiciles, as the Supreme Court has ruled that new domiciles will be considered and such changes will not affect the provincial quota.
The judgement, a copy of which available with Dawn, was issued by a two-judge SC bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi.
The petition was filed by Dr Shumaila Naeem, a gold medallist, who joined government service as a medical officer based on her Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domicile. After marrying a civil servant with a Balochistan domicile, she changed her domicile to that of her husband.

SC allows domicile change without career risk for couples in govt service

Subsequently, based on her new Balochistan domicile, she applied for the advertised post of Associate Professor (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), BPS-19, at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. She topped the written exam conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), but was not called for an interview due to her domicile change, with the FPSC alleging that her original domicile was from KP.
Speaking to Dawn, Shumaila Naeem said her departmental representation and subsequent review petition were dismissed by the FPSC. “However, my appeal under Section 7(3)(d) of the FPSC Ordinance 1977 was allowed by the Islamabad High Court through a judgement dated January 28, 2025 by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq. But instead of implementing the IHC order, the FPSC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court,” she said.
“The apex court held that a married woman retains the legal discretion or choice to either adopt her husband’s domicile or retain her own,” she added.
The court ruled that the respondent had voluntarily opted to adopt her husband’s domicile, which is legally permissible. It rejected the FPSC’s stance and declared that the seat of Associate Professor is still vacant. The court directed that the candidate be considered for appointment to the post on the basis of her Balochistan domicile within a fortnight.
Dr Shumaila said that in the past, many female civil servants had no choice but to work in a province different from their husbands’.
“This decision, which has now become a precedent, will allow them to change their domiciles and serve at the same station as their husbands. It will bring peace of mind to them and their families,” she said.

• Tasks Kundi with engaging opposition MPAs to explore options for forming a new govt
• Aimal Wali warns against dissolving KP govt, advises PM to ‘let it collapse on its own’
ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‘regime change’ in Khyber Pakht­un­khwa (KP), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation.
The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events had further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan called on the PM, where they discussed the prevailing political scenario.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ameer Maqam,  Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashar Iqbal, Prime Minister’s  Adviser Rana Sanaullah, Minister of State for Power Abdul Rehman Kanju  and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Talha Barki were also  present on the occasion.
A source close to Governor Kundi told Dawn that the issue of possible change of KP government was thoroughly discussed.
 
 

“Yes, we discussed the matter,” the source quoted Mr Kundi as saying. A press release issued by the governor’s spokesperson said the PM  tasked Mr Kundi to start a campaign for forming a new government in KP and hold consultation with opposition members of the provincial assembly.
Mr Kundi and federal minister Ameer Muqam have also been tasked to meet JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultation.
But others offered different counsel. When contacted, ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan told Dawn that the issue was discussed during his meeting with the PM. However, he said he had advised the premier against dissolving the KP government through  ‘external means’.
“I told the PM that let the KP government die its own death. If you (PM) remove the provincial government, you will give an easy escape to the PTI-led regime, which has completely failed to deliver,” Mr Aimal said.
He said KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has no other way but to leave the government and if the Centre made any attempt to topple the PTI-led regime in KP, it would be a welcome move for the CM. “I told PM that Ali Amin Gandapur has taken maximum benefits after becoming CM and it will be a blessing for him if he is removed and sent home,” he added.
 
 

He further said the prime minister was ultimately convinced that forcefully removing the provincial government would be a mistake. “We are already suffering due to the trend of toppling governments and now how can we do it by ourselves,” he said.
Saudi peace efforts
PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appreciated the efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for peace in the Middle East as well as its significant role in the ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India.

The prime minister said this in a meeting with the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Islamabad Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, while fondly recalling his warm and cordial telephone conversation with the Saudi Crown Prince on June 24.
The PM told the ambassador that as Pakistan had assumed the rotating Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July, and it would count on Saudi Arabia’s support to ensure that its tenure was conducted smoothly and successfully.
PM to visit Baku
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office announced the PM would attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting on July 3.
In a statement, it said the PM will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.

Rover finds a clue</strong></a><br><p>PARIS: Why is Mars barren and uninhabitable, while life has always thrived here on our relatively similar planet Earth? A discovery made by a Nasa rover has offered a clue for this mystery, new research said on Wednesday, suggesting that while rivers once sporadically flowed on Mars, it was doomed to mostly be a desert planet.
Mars is thought to currently have all the necessary ingredients for life except for perhaps the most important one: liquid water. However, the red surface is carved out by ancient rivers and lakes, showing that water once flowed on our nearest neighbour.
There are currently several rovers searching Mars for signs of life that could have existed back in those more habitable times, millions of years ago.
Earlier this year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover discovered a missing piece in this puzzle: rocks that are rich in carbonate minerals. These  “carbonates” — such as limestone on Earth — act as a sponge for carbon dioxide, pulling it in from the atmosphere and trapping it in rock.
A new study, published in the journal Nature, modelled exactly how the existence of these rocks could change our understanding of Mars’s past.
Brief ‘oases’
Lead study author Edwin Kite, a planetary scientist at the University of Chicago and a member of the Curiosity team, said it appeared there were  “blips of habitability in some times and places” on Mars. But these  “oases” were the exception rather than the rule.
On Earth, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet. Over long timescales, the carbon becomes trapped in rocks such as carbonates. Then, volcanic eruptions spew the gas back into the atmosphere, creating a well-balanced climate cycle supportive of consistently running water.
However, Mars has a “feeble” rate of volcanic outgassing compared to Earth, Kite said. This throws off the balance, leaving Mars much colder and less hospitable.
According to the modelling research, the brief periods of liquid water on Mars were followed by 100 million years of barren desert — a long time for anything to survive.
It is still possible that there are pockets of liquid water deep underground on Mars we have not yet found, Kite said. Nasa’s Perseverance Rover, which landed on an ancient Martian delta in 2021, has also found signs of carbonates at the edge of dried-up lake, he added. Next, the scientists hope to discover more evidence of carbonates.
Kite said the best proof would be returning rock samples from the Martian surface back to Earth — both the United States and China are racing to do this in the next decade.
Are we alone?
Ultimately, scientists are searching for an answer to one of the great questions: how common are planets like Earth that can harbour life? Astronomers have discovered nearly 6,000 planets beyond our Solar System since the early 1990s. But only for Mars and Earth can scientists study rocks which allow them to understand the planet’s past, Kite said.
If we do determine that Mars never hosted even tiny micro-organisms during its watery times, that would indicate it is difficult to kick-start life across the universe.
But if we discover proof of ancient life, that would  “basically be telling us the origin of life is easy on a planetary scale,” Kite said.

A Pakistani delegation, headed by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, reached Washington this week, hoping to secure a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would avert the reimposition of a 29 per cent US tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. The tariff relief was temporarily paused earlier this year, but a final decision hinges on the outcome of the ongoing talks.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that Washington may allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful progress is visible, potentially pushing the cutoff toward Labour Day. However, Pakistani officials say they are working to complete the deal this week to remove any uncertainty for exporters and investors.
The proposed framework includes increased Pakistani imports of US goods — particularly crude oil — alongside incentives for American investment in Pakistan’s mining, infrastructure, and energy sectors. Key projects under discussion include the Reko Diq copper-gold mine and associated energy infrastructure. The agreement is also expected to pave the way for greater engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Pakistani negotiators are optimistic that a deal can be finalised this week, ensuring continued access to the US market.

The officer said the father told police that his son had developed a “friendship” with members of the transgender community and used to meet them frequently. He said he had repeatedly warned his son to stay away from the transpersons but he won’t listen. 
The father claimed that he initially gave electric shocks to him and later killed him with a shovel. The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities.
The suspect is known to be religiously inclined and showed no remorse over the killing, the SHO said, adding that the police were waiting for medical confirmation regarding the alleged electric shocks.
