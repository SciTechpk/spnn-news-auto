Making his first White House visit in more than seven years, the crown prince was greeted with a lavish display of pomp and ceremony presided over by Trump on the South Lawn, complete with a military honour guard, a cannon salute and a flyover by US warplanes.

Talks between the two leaders are expected to advance security ties, civil nuclear cooperation and multibillion-dollar business deals with the kingdom. But there will likely be no major breakthrough on Saudi Arabia normalising ties with Israel, despite pressure from Trump for such a landmark move.
The meeting underscores a key relationship — between the world’s biggest economy and the top oil exporter — that Trump has made a high priority in his second term as the international uproar around the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi insider-turned-critic, has gradually faded.
US intelligence concluded that MBS approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi. The crown prince denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
The warm welcome he has received in Washington is the latest sign that relations have recovered from the deep strain caused by Khashoggi’s murder.
 


Trump greeted MBS with a smile and a handshake on the red carpet, while dozens of military personnel lined the perimeter. The limousine was escorted up the South Drive by a US Army mounted honour guard. The two leaders then looked skyward as fighter jets roared overhead, before Trump led his guest inside.
During a day of White House diplomacy, MBS will hold talks with Trump in the Oval Office, have lunch in the Cabinet Room and attend a formal black-tie dinner in the evening.

Trump hopes to cash in on a $600 billion Saudi investment pledge made during his visit to the kingdom in May. A senior White House official told Reuters that US-Saudi deals on technology, manufacturing, defence and more are expected.
Trump told reporters on Monday, “We’ll be selling” F-35s to Saudi Arabia, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft.
This would be the first US sale of the fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and mark a significant policy shift. The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35.
Beyond military equipment, the Saudi leader is seeking security guarantees, access to artificial intelligence technology and progress on a deal on a civilian nuclear programme.
“The Saudis will be spending a lot of money tomorrow on the US,” a senior White House official told Reuters on Monday.
Eye on China
Former US negotiator in the Middle East Dennis Ross, who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Trump wants to develop a multifaceted relationship that keeps Saudi Arabia out of China’s sphere.
“President Trump believes all these steps bind the Saudis increasingly to us on a range of issues, ranging from security to the finance-AI-energy nexus. He wants them bound to us on these issues and not China,” Ross said.
Trump is expected to pressure MBS for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords and normalise relations with Israel.
The Saudis have been reluctant to take such a major step without a clear path to Palestinian statehood, a goal that has been forced to the back burner as the region grapples with the Gaza onslaught.
Trump reached Abraham Accords agreements between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Sudan during his first term in 2020. In recent weeks, Kazakhstan agreed to join.
But Trump has always seen Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords as the linchpin to achieving a wider Middle East peace.
“It’s very important to him that they join the Abraham Accords during his term and so he has been hyping up the pressure on that,” the senior White House official said.
Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy national intelligence officer on the Middle East, said that while Trump will urge MBS to move toward normalising ties with Israel, any lack of progress there is unlikely to hinder reaching a new US-Saudi security pact.
“President Trump’s desire for investment into the US, which the crown prince previously promised, could help soften the ground for expanding defence ties even as the president is determined to advance Israeli-Saudi normalisation,” said Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18095705985e07b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955818/38-terrorists-killed-in-four-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>38 terrorists killed in four separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively.
It said that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was killed in the Bajaur IBO.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian-sponsored” terrorists found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
“We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18182104907866e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955853/after-unsc-vote-on-gaza-plan-netanyahu-calls-for-hamass-expulsion-from-the-region' target='_blank'><strong>After UNSC vote on Gaza plan, Netanyahu calls for Hamas’s expulsion from the region</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday called for Hamas to be expelled from the region, a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) endorsed United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan that offers the Palestinian group amnesty.
Netanyahu publicly endorsed the plan during a White House visit in late September. However, his latest remarks appear to show that there are differences with the US on the path forward. Hamas has also objected to parts of the plan.
Diplomats say privately that entrenched positions on both the Israeli and Hamas sides have made it difficult to advance the plan, which lacks specific timelines or enforcement mechanisms. Still, it has received strong international backing, including from the Arab and Muslim countries that worked on it.
Netanyahu on Tuesday published a series of posts on X in response to the UN vote. In one post, he applauded Trump and in another wrote the Israeli government believes the plan would lead to peace and prosperity because it calls for the “full demilitarisation, disarmament, and deradicalisation of Gaza”.
 






“Israel extends its hand in peace and prosperity to all of our neighbours” and calls on neighbouring countries to “join us in expelling Hamas and its supporters from the region”, he said.
Asked what the prime minister had meant by expelling Hamas, a spokesperson said that it would mean “ensuring there is no Hamas in Gaza as outlined in the 20-point plan, and Hamas has no ability to govern the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip”.
 






Plan does not call for Hamas’s expulsion
Trump’s 20-point plan includes a clause saying that Hamas members “who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty”, and members who wish to leave will be given safe passage to third countries.
Another clause says Hamas will agree to not having any role in Gaza’s governance.
There is no clause that explicitly calls for the resistance group to disband or to leave Gaza.
The plan says reforms to the Palestinian Authority may ultimately allow conditions “for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
 
 

Ahead of the UN vote, Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to Palestinian statehood after protests by far-right coalition allies over a US-backed statement indicating support for a pathway to Palestinian independence.
Netanyahu also opposes any Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza.
European and Arab states have said that Gaza must be governed by the Palestinian Authority and that there must be a clear pathway to Palestinian independence.
First step towards peace: Palestinian Authority
The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, earlier welcomed the vote and has said it is ready to take part in Trump’s plan, which doesn’t outline a clear role for the authority.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin termed the UNSC resolution the “first step in a long road towards peace”.
“That step was needed because we could not embark on anything else before we had a ceasefire,” Shahin told reporters in Manila during a visit to the Philippines.
 


Shahin said there were still other issues that needed to be addressed, including Palestinian self-determination and eventual Palestinian independence, and that the process for implementing Trump’s plan must be governed by international law.
She said that although Trump’s plan alludes to possible Palestinian statehood only after the Palestinian Authority carries out reforms, that issue could be taken up later. “As long as these elements are in there, we’re happy with this first step,” Shahin said.
Multinational force for post-war Gaza
The UNSC resolution authorised a multinational force that Trump’s plan says will be temporarily deployed to Gaza to stabilise the territory.
The resolution’s text also says member states could join a “Board of Peace” that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery inside Gaza.
Hamas has criticised the resolution as failing to “live up to the demands and political and humanitarian rights” of the Palestinian people, who it said rejected an international guardianship mechanism of Gaza.
 
 

Any international force must only be deployed along Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and under UN supervision, Hamas said in a statement, warning that such a force would lose its neutrality if it tried to disarm the group.
Reham Owda, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza, said the Hamas statement should be viewed as an objection, rather than complete rejection, in an attempt to negotiate mechanisms for the international force and the role of the board of peace.
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10 as part of Trump’s multi-phased plan to end Israel’s two-year relentless bombardment.
Israel has partially withdrawn its forces but still controls 53 per cent of Gaza and the sides have accused each other of violations.
Abu Abdallah, a businessman displaced in central Gaza, said Palestinians would support the deployment of international forces if it meant that Israel would fully withdraw its forces.
“Hamas can’t decide our fate alone, but we also don’t want to get rid of one occupation, Israel, and get another international occupation,” he said by phone.
Water provider suspends services after Hamas detains staff member
Separately, a Gaza company that operates water desalination plants serving nearly half of the enclave’s population has stopped operations to protest the detention by Hamas of one of its staff.
Youssef Yassin, a board member of the Abdul Salam Yassin Company, said the move would affect more than 1 million people who normally receive water from the company.

Over 70 trucks that carry water containers across the enclave have also stopped operations, he added, risking further supply disruption after the pipeline network was badly damaged due to Israel’s bombing.
“I know it is catastrophic but protecting our employees is a sacred issue,” Yassin told Reuters.
Yassin said Hamas had given no reason for the arrest late on Monday. Hamas had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Hamas has been gradually reasserting control in areas of Gaza that Israel has withdrawn from as post-war talks over its future grind on. Foreign powers demand the group disarm and leave government but have yet to agree who will replace them.
Israel continues to control around half the Gaza Strip.
The move is a rare show of dissent against Hamas, which has run the Palestinian enclave since 2007.
 
 

Demonstrations briefly erupted in March and April, demanding an end to the war and that Hamas give up power, but fizzled out after a warning that public disorder would not be tolerated.
If the protest by the company persists, it could exacerbate the chronic water crisis in the enclave, which was worsened further by two years of Israel’s siege. Israel stopped all water and electricity supply to Gaza early in the offensive, resuming only a trickle of supplies later.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634272-23-india-backed-terrorists-killed-in-two-kp-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>23 India-backed terrorists killed in two KP IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement released by the US Justice Department last Friday, Acting US Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas Jay R Combs identified the woman as 34-year-old Kahkashan Haider Khan.
The Justice Department stated that Haider pleaded guilty to making false statements in relation to international terrorism and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison by US District Judge Amos L Mazzant III on October 7, 2025.
“We will not allow the United States to be a launching point for terrorist attacks abroad,” said Acting US Attorney Jay R Combs.
“Vigilantly protecting the United States and its interests is inherent in everything we do. This includes aggressively prosecuting those who wrongly believe that they can find safe harbour in the United States while plotting crimes elsewhere.”
FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R Joseph Rothrock said, “The FBI will aggressively investigate individuals planning or taking part in acts of violence in support of terrorism. We take these crimes seriously and will work with our international partners to hold perpetrators accountable.”
According to information presented in court, on February 23, 2023, Haider was interviewed by special agents from the FBI regarding her involvement in the planned fire-bombing of two gas stations in Karachi.
The Justice Department identified Haider, a US citizen and immigrant from Pakistan, as “a member of a separatist movement in Pakistan known as the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which claims grievances against the Pakistani government over the treatment of muhajir immigrants in Pakistan”.
The statement claimed that Haider “served as a recruiter and facilitator of terrorist actions in Pakistan by collecting funds, sending them to Pakistan, and arranging and paying for violent actions in Pakistan”.
The department reported that in January 2023, Haider recruited an individual in Pakistan to conduct fire-bombings on two Punjabi-owned gas stations in Karachi, Pakistan.
Haider discussed multiple aspects of the plan with her co-conspirator in Pakistan, including selecting the target locations, discussing which flammable accelerants to use, where to stage before the attacks, how to escape after the attacks, and arranging for the purchase of two firearms to be used by the attackers to ensure their success, the statement added.
The department claimed that Haider collected money from MQM sympathisers in the United States and wired the funds to Pakistan to pay for the attacks.
The details show that on February 20, 2023, Haider’s co-conspirator in Pakistan sent her photos from news coverage of a fire-bombing of a Karachi gas station caused by attackers throwing something from a vehicle, resulting in six people being burned.
Haider “celebrated the news and told her Pakistani co-conspirator that he would be greatly rewarded for his work. Throughout that day, February 20, 2023, Haider scoured the internet for news in Pakistan regarding the fire-bombing but could find none.”
After approximately one day of searching, she discovered that the photos her co-conspirator sent were from an event that occurred in October 2022. Haider “was furious and accused her co-conspirator of deceit and being a disgrace to the MQM movement”, the Justice Department noted.
On February 23, 2024, FBI special agents interviewed Haider at her home about these events. During the interview, she made multiple false statements about the events and lied about her involvement in the attempted attacks.
Haider denied that she wanted a co-conspirator to commit the fire-bombings in Pakistan. She denied that she was involved in an action in Pakistan that would possibly result in someone’s harm or death.
During her plea hearing in February 2025, she admitted that these were false statements made knowing that the statements were material to a terrorism investigation.</p><small>2025-11-18 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18203838fba10f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955850/cloudflare-says-fix-implemented-issue-resolved-after-global-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Cloudflare says fix implemented, issue resolved after global outage</strong></a><br><p>Cloudflare, a content delivery network (CDN) and domain name server (DNS) service, said on Tuesday that it had implemented a fix and that the issue was now resolved following a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide
“A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,” said an update from the CDN, whose network handles around a fifth of web traffic, posted at 7:42pm.
It later said that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. “We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues,” it added.
The incident marked the latest hit to major online services. An outage of Amazon’s cloud service last month caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.
Cloudflare — whose shares were down about five per cent in premarket trading — runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Earlier today, disruptions in internet access were widely reported as Cloudflare reported experiencing issues in its global network.
In an update on the situation posted at 6:09pm, it said: “We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London. We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.”
It later said it was continuing to work on restoring service for application services customers.
Earlier, the service provider said it was “aware of and investigating an issue” that was impacting multiple customers with widespread 500 errors, along with the Cloudflare dashboard and API application programming interface also failing.
NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, also said that a wide range of online services were experiencing disruptions due to a technical issue affecting Cloudflare’s global network. It added that the incident was not related to “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
 






Downdetector showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10 pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also down for thousands of users in the United States and worldwide, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
There were more than 11,500 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 6:41am ET, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
It was not immediately clear whether the outages were related.
X and Cloudflare did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said it was monitoring the global outage and was in contact with global platforms and local operators. It added that it would continue to observe the situation until services were fully restored.
Cloudflare had also reported a “widespread outage” in June 2022 and several popular websites were unreachable.

The senior PTI leader, incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail since 2023, was hospitalised at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications on October 31, his daughter Meher Bano said. She added that his condition deteriorated while imprisoned and that surgery was “unavoidable”.
Speaking to Dawn, Umer said Qureshi’s gallbladder was successfully removed during the procedure.
“Shah Mehmood Qureshi will remain under the constant supervision of doctors for a few days,” he stated. “Shah Mehmood Qureshi has appealed to the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.”
Meher Bano also spoke to Dawn about the procedure, saying that the procedure was successful and the PTI leader is currently under observation.
“The size of the stone inside the gallbladder was quite large, so the surgery took longer than usual,” she explained. “[The doctor] performed the surgery successfully in the best possible manner.”
Meher Bano added that Qureshi’s recovery will “take some time”, expressing gratitude to people for their prayers.
Meanwhile, PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser, in a post on X, prayed for Qureshi’s speedy recovery.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi sahib has been enduring innocent imprisonment for the past two years due to his loyalty and steadfastness to Imran Khan’s vision,” he wrote. “The courage, patience, resolve, and spirit with which he has borne this trial set an exemplary standard within him. I salute his steadfastness.”
 






After Qureshi was hospitalised, three former PTI leaders arrived in his hospital room at the start of November to convince him to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by the ex-FM.
According to Umer, former leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood managed to gain access to Qureshi when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-18 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181900090748f2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955860/what-are-the-pitfalls-for-uks-asylum-system-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>What are the pitfalls for UK’s asylum system overhaul</strong></a><br><p>The UK government has unveiled unprecedented changes to its asylum system in a bid to deter irregular migration and make deportations easier.
How long will it take to implement the measures? Will there be any obstacles, and could the proposals be effective in discouraging small boat crossings, which successive governments have failed to curb?
What is the timeline?
The policy paper titled “Restoring Order and Control” was announced on Monday by interior minister Shabana Mahmood, who told lawmakers the reforms would discourage migrants from crossing the Channel from France on small boats.
Many of the changes will need to be introduced as new legislation and be approved by parliament, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party holds a significant majority.
The interior ministry has said it will end its legal obligation to provide support to asylum seekers “in the coming months”.
Other changes —  including increasing the time refugees must wait before applying for permanent residency from five to 20 years — will be subject to a public consultation before the legislation applying them is drafted, meaning they could take longer to implement.
A consultation will also be launched on plans to deport families, including children, who are refused asylum.
“For a lot of these important details, the government has said they will consult in the future, or they will announce next year exactly what’s going to happen,” Mihnea Cuibus, researcher at the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory, told AFP.
“Some things are still very much in the air,” said Cuibus.
What hurdles could it face?
One of the most contentious proposals — modelled on Denmark’s strict asylum system — is making refugee status temporary.
Refugees will have their status reviewed every 30 months and be forced to leave if their home country is deemed “safe”.
Critics have said this could be costly and slow down the interior ministry, known as the Home Office, which is already struggling to process a backlog of asylum applications and appeals.
The government will also have to balance its stricter policies with constitutional safeguards.
It has said it will introduce other legal pathways for asylum seekers, including for vulnerable groups like unaccompanied children and families with children.
But it will face questions about plans to deport families and children who are deemed ineligible for asylum or, once their home countries are considered safe, as well as moves to end automatic family reunions.
There are also concerns that concerns that ending guaranteed benefits for asylum seekers could clash with core legal obligations to support children in need. Cuibus said it was still “early” to understand how vulnerable groups will be affected.
“Oftentimes, even in policies that are quite strict, we do tend to see potential exemptions for vulnerable groups.” Policies could face legal challenges, and they will be debated in parliament, where some left-wing Labour MPs and the leftist Greens have expressed discontent.
But the centre-right Conservative opposition indicated it could back the proposals, while the head of policy of the hard-right Reform UK party said “rhetorically, we would agree with a lot of what the home secretary said.”
Will it be effective?
Charities have warned that the policy revamp will not deter people, many fleeing conflict, from making the crossings, with rising numbers risking the perilous journey.
The government insists it will make the UK less desirable for migrants, and policies like allowing asylum claimants only one appeal will fast-track deportations of those whose claims are rejected.
It will also legislate to require courts to only consider “immediate family” when deportations are challenged under the right to family life.
However, commentators point out that this is already largely the case.
The interior ministry threatened to stop granting visas to nationals from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless they accepted the return of “their criminals and illegal immigrants”.
“The imposition of visa penalties on one country will send a message to all,” the policy paper states.
According to analysis by the PA news agency, only 14 nationals from the targeted countries entered the UK illegally in the year to June 2025 — around 0.02 per cent of the total number of irregular migrants who arrived.</p><small>2025-11-18 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18183230c841ff6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955859/explainer-why-did-a-cloudflare-outage-cause-websites-to-go-down' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: Why did a Cloudflare outage cause websites to go down?</strong></a><br><p>Disruptions in internet access were widely reported on Tuesday as Cloudflare, a content delivery network and domain name server (DNS) service, reported it was experiencing issues in its global network.
Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources, showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services, and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also experiencing outages, with more than 5,600 reports of issues with the social media platform, as of 06:51am Eastern Time (4:51pm PKT), according to Downdetector.
Cloudflare said it was “aware of and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers”, but how did their service going down cause outages on multiple platforms?
What is a DNS service provider?
A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast.
All websites rely on DNS service providers like Amazon Web Services, GoDaddy and Cloudflare to function so that users can find and connect to the site’s server. This applies to online businesses, news outlets and social media platforms, among others.
When the provider experiences an outage, like Cloudflare did today, websites using that service will become inaccessible, as users cannot connect to the site’s server.
What causes these outages?
Websites and other services going down can be attributed to a DNS outage, which the BBC reported was the root cause of a major outage of Amazon Web Services last month, which rendered over 1,000 websites and services inaccessible.
DNS hosting service ClouDNS says on its website that a DNS outage is “a period of time when the domain name can’t be resolved to its IP address”. It adds that these can be caused by poor configuration or issues in data centres, maintenance of the authoritative server or even cyberattacks.
What are the consequences?

The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.
Speaking after the oath, Rathore said, “First of all, I thank God from my heart for bestowing this heavy responsibility on my weak shoulders.”
The newly sworn-in premier said fulfilling those duties would not be an “easy task in this extremely difficult era”, but said he believed God gave strength to those entrusted with such tasks.
 


Rathore also thanked President Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur, saying that owing to them, not only was a “new government established, but the PPP has again become one of the biggest parties” in AJK.
The PPP leader termed AJK a “basecamp” of the freedom movement for Kashmir. “It aims to cultivate this movement and fully play its role in it while staying here,” he said.
The new premier highlighted that another key point was the region’s development and progress. He paid tribute to the martyrs of the freedom movement and the soldiers on the Line of Control.
 
 

Rathore also recalled that in 1975, ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had chosen his father late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore as a senior minister, and later in 1990, ex-PM Benazir Bhutto chose him as the AJK premier “despite him being a part of a small community in the PPP”.
“And now, in 2025, the party leadership trusted me and sent me into this field,” Rathore added. He went on to affirm that this “relationship of trust based on half a decade” would remain between him and his party.
‘Six months are a test’
PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also spoke on the occasion, urging the people to work together with his party. He also called for the restoration of open courts in the region.
Pointing out that elections were due in AJK in six months, he asked the PPP’s head in the region, Chaudhry Yasin, to start preparing for the polls.
He further assured that the PPP would not run the government from “closed rooms”.
“We will sit among the public, meet them, join their political struggle, and resolve their problems.”
He further stated: “These six months are a test. After this test, we will […] again get the people’s mandate and again lead this government. And we will show the world that when we work together […] when we don’t fight among ourselves, how my Kashmir progresses on the global stage.”
 


The PPP chairman then went on to call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “coward”, saying that he had been “hiding his face from the world” following the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May. Meanwhile, Bilawal said, Pakistan’s diplomatic standing had improved.
He also slammed Modi over a “conspiracy to undermine the relationship between Pakistan and the people of Azad Kashmir”.
“I want to tell Modi that you lost the war, and God willing, this conspiracy of yours will also be unsuccessful. No one can undermine the relationship between the PPP and the public of Azad Kashmir,” Bilawal added.
Prosperity of AJK’s people among Centre’s priorities: Shehbaz
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly elected Rathore that the prosperity and progress of the region were among the federal government’s top priorities.

In a phone call, PM Shehbaz conveyed his heartfelt congratulations to Rathore on being chosen as the new premier of AJK, state-run PTV News reported.
“The progress and prosperity of AJK’s people are among the federal government’s priorities,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.
He further assured Rathore that the Centre was determined to work with the AJK government for the “welfare, economic development, prosperity, and peace and security” of the region’s public.
PM Shehbaz pledged that the federal government will provide “every possible cooperation” to the AJK set-up. He also expressed his best wishes to the PM-elect for his tenure.
 






Rathore is AJK’s fourth premier in the last four years, and the 16th since 1975 when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The no-confidence vote against Chaudhry had sailed through on Monday with 36 votes from PPP and PML-N members, while two PTI opposition members voted against it.
Under the AJK Constitution, a note of no-confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
After his election yesterday, the 47-year-old PM-elect announced several administrative measures, including a downsizing process, a new transport policy for officials, and limiting the number of secretaries to 20. He also pledged to address public issues and cater to the needs of low-paid staff.</p><small>2025-11-18 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1817211523b48ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955852/sarajevo-siege-survivors-hope-for-justice-as-italy-probes-alleged-sniper-tourism' target='_blank'><strong>Sarajevo siege survivors hope for justice as Italy probes alleged ‘sniper tourism’</strong></a><br><p>The launch of an investigation in Italy into allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo three decades ago has raised survivors’ hopes that people will be brought to justice.
About 11,000 civilians were killed by shelling and sniper fire from Bosnian Serb army positions on hills around the besieged city during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia.
Milan prosecutors opened their investigation, a source said, after local journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni filed a legal complaint over allegations that Italians and other foreigners had paid members of the Bosnian Serb forces to visit and shoot at civilians under what some referred to as “sniper tourism”.
Gavazzeni said he had been inspired to look into the allegations after watching a 2022 documentary titled Sarajevo Safari, by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic.
Without providing any firm evidence, Gavazzeni said wealthy foreigners paid large sums of money to take part in the shooting trips. He said the Italians used to meet in the city of Trieste before travelling to Belgrade, where Bosnian Serb soldiers escorted them to the hills overlooking Sarajevo.
Old wounds reopened
Opening an investigation is a formality in Italy when such a legal complaint is filed, and no individual suspects have been named. But some Sarajevo residents welcomed the investigation even though it reopened old wounds.
“I am completely shocked,” said Muamer Kalic, a Sarajevo University professor who spent the war in Sarajevo. “These are planetary disasters, and those who admired or financed that should, at the very least, face hanging or life imprisonment.”
Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were jailed for life for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but many Sarajevo residents want others brought to justice.
 
 

Former Sarajevo Mayor Benjamina Karic said she hoped news of the Milan prosecutors’ investigation would pave the way for Bosnian state prosecutors to open an investigation into former Bosnian Serb army commanders and individuals over the siege.
“As a child who grew up and survived the siege of Sarajevo…I have special emotions about this case and truly want to believe the investigation will be initiated,” said Karic.
In a statement to Reuters, the Bosnian state prosecutor’s office said it had not been contacted by the Milan prosecutors.
The Milan prosecutors have not commented on the case.
Edin Subasic, a retired Bosnian army intelligence officer who featured in Zupanic’s documentary, said he learnt of the allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians in 1993 from the testimony of a captured Bosnian Serb army soldier.
“It attracted our attention because it was extraordinary to have civilians with hunting rifles and highly sophisticated equipment on the battlefield,” Subasic told Reuters.
Subasic said Bosnian army intelligence had forwarded the allegations at the time to an Italian military intelligence agency.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181414008ef7d85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955840/economic-coordination-committee-approves-grants-for-security-defence-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Economic Coordination Committee approves grants for security, defence projects</strong></a><br><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Tuesday approved grants pertaining to Pakistan’s security and defence.
In a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a meeting of the ECC that was attended by federal ministers, special assistants to the prime minister, secretaries, and senior officials from relevant divisions.
It said the ECC approved “several strategic grants and reforms aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s security framework, defence capabilities, food security, and petroleum sector operations”.
 






According to the ministry’s statement, a technical supplementary grant of Rs100.3 million was approved for the maintenance of defence equipment used by the federal civil armed forces.
A technical supplementary grant of Rs841.56m was also approved for enhanced border management, internal security and law and order. Further, a technical supplementary grant of Rs50 billion was also approved for defence services projects.
The ECC also decided to establish a new special purpose vehicle, with initial paid-up capital of Rs1,000,000, to take forward the winding up of Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation, along with “measures to incentivise foreign participation in offshore oil and gas exploration, including licence extensions and working interest assignments”.
ECC greenlights offshore exploration consortium
Pakistan also approved a new offshore exploration consortium, clearing Turkish Petroleum Overseas Company (TPOC) to take over operatorship of the Eastern Offshore Block-C as part of a push to revive drilling, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said.
The ECC approved Pakistan Petroleum Limited’s request to assign part of its interest in the block to TPOC, Mari Energies and state-run Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd, leaving PPL with a 35 per cent stake.
TPOC will hold 25pc and will operate the block once a formal agreement is signed.
“This will bring valuable international offshore operating experience to Pakistan’s exploration landscape and this transition is expected to enhance technical capabilities, operational efficiency, and overall project delivery,” Schehzad wrote on X.
He said the block contains a drill-ready prospect that the consortium will now pursue, a step he added could attract fresh foreign investment.
“With the ECC’s approval, the consortium is now set to advance preparations for drilling operations, marking a new chapter in the country’s pursuit of energy security and resource development,” he said.
 






In October, bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres, in the first offshore bidding round since 2007.
Pakistan’s 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since independence in 1947; too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential.
Finmin meets delegation representing group founded by tech entrepreneurs
Separately, Finance Minister Aurangzeb held a meeting with a high-level delegation representing Dialog, an invite-only network founded by tech entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman.
In a handout, the ministry said the delegation was led by Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui and also included UK House of Lords Member Simon Stevens, Austrian MP Veit Valentin Dengler, Norwegian MP Himanshu Gulati, Jigsaw Chief Executive Officer Yasmin Green, Xbox-Microsoft Vice President Fatima Kardar and others.
The ministry said that during the meeting, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s economic reforms.
 






He also stressed the government’s focus on tax reform, energy sector restructuring, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, governance reforms, and rationalisation of federal expenditures.
“He emphasised efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base by integrating technology and artificial intelligence-based monitoring, enhancing compliance, and bringing under-taxed sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale/retail into the tax net,” the press release said.
The minister also discussed ongoing pension reforms, including the shift to contributory schemes for new entrants and upcoming measures to tackle long-term fiscal liabilities.
Aurangzeb outlined governance improvements in electricity distribution companies, loss-reduction initiatives, private-sector representation on boards, and a renewed privatisation pipeline.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a competitive tariff regime, long-term sustainability, and greater private-sector participation,” the handout said.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1616410421225a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955261/militancy-the-new-face-of-al-qaeda' target='_blank'><strong>MILITANCY: THE NEW FACE OF AL QAEDA</strong></a><br><p>In a recent video report, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle News observed that “more than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished, it’s adapted.”
This assessment is reinforced by recent reports from the world’s leading news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Al Jazeera, which indicate that one of Al Qaeda’s regional affiliates, Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), is on the verge of capturing the Malian capital, Bamako.
Operating across the Sahel region of West Africa, primarily in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, JNIM is imposing an economic siege on the capital by blocking routes used by fuel tankers, effectively bringing the country to a standstill.
Despite the elimination or arrest of its top to mid-ranking leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan (Af-Pak) region over the last two decades — through extensive US-led counter-terrorism operations across Af-Pak, the Middle East and Africa — Al Qaeda has persisted by adopting a key strategy: evolving from a hierarchical, centralised organisational structure to a decentralised network of franchises.

More than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished — it’s adapted. As one of its regional affiliates brings Mali’s capital to a standstill and another, Al Shabaab, regains ground in Somalia, extremist networks are once again touting the establishment of Islamic emirates…

These franchises have been granted operational autonomy while adhering to Al Qaeda Central’s (AQC) general ideology. This strategic shift has enabled the group to maintain its influence and continue its operations, even in the face of significant leadership losses.
Apart from JNIM, Al Shabaab — another formidable Al-Qaeda affiliate — currently controls significant portions of southern and central Somalia, as of November 2025. The group has recently regained ground, reversing many of the territorial losses incurred during the Somali government’s 2022-2023 counter-offensive.
Recently, a number of encrypted extremist channels, known for sharing propaganda from the Az-Zallaqah Foundation — the official media and propaganda arm of JNIM — featured one common written commentary with a bold prediction. “It seems that before the end of this year, the jihadists will have an Islamic state or emirate, either in Mali, Somalia or both.”
THE EVOLUTION OF AFFILIATES
These developments are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a broader extremist context and trend. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has proven to be a key catalyst, ideologically inspiring and operationally emboldening extremist groups — including regional entities such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and global networks like Al Qaeda — to pursue territorial control.
Al Qaeda is now predominantly managed by its affiliates, while its central leadership remains largely restricted to issuing general directives. Following the assassination of its second top leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, the organisation has been unable to formally announce his successor.
The first affiliate, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), was established in 2004, followed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2006-2007 in North Africa and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009.
Al Shabaab, recognised as Al-Qaeda’s most affluent affiliate, with reported estimated annual revenue exceeding $100 million, emerged in 2012. Subsequently, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) was formed in September 2014, and JNIM, which includes AQIM and four Malian armed groups, was established in 2017. Additionally, Hurras al-Din (HAD) surfaced in Syria in early 2018.
Among the affiliates mentioned above, several have either gradually become completely defunct, merged with others, or dissolved. For instance, AQIM merged with JNIM, HAD was declared dissolved by Al-Qaeda, while AQI evolved into the Islamic State (IS).
 
 

The split between Al Qaeda and the IS became official in February 2014, when Al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relationship with the IS. It came after months of tension between the two groups, sparked by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s refusal to follow directives from Al Qaeda’s central command led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, on ideological, operational and organisational matters.
The most intriguing case in our region is the Al Qaeda branch, AQIS, which was once responsible for nearly all significant attacks against key security installations throughout Pakistan, alongside the TTP. AQIS also played a crucial role in supporting the TTP in ideological, operational and propaganda efforts, but it is now primarily limited to disseminating propaganda content and is operationally inactive.
IMPACT OF THE DOHA PEACE AGREEMENT
Analysts maintain that AQC and AQIS have become the primary casualties of the US-Taliban Doha peace agreement in 2020, as a key condition of the deal is to prevent Al Qaeda from using Afghan soil to “threaten the security of the United States and its allies.”
As a result of these bilateral arrangements, AQC is even unable to acknowledge the death of its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul in July 2022 or to announce his successor formally, while AQIS’s operations have completely disappeared.
The Doha Agreement created a paradox for Al Qaeda, explains Riccardo Valle, my colleague and head of research at The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform focusing on extremist groups and conflict. “It achieved their primary goal of empowering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but it also forced AQC and AQIS to adopt a low profile, to avoid provoking the Americans,” he continues. “This has led AQIS to redirect its focus to Pakistan, supporting the Pakistani Taliban’s campaign against the state, often under the guise of new alliances.”
A RESILIENT THREAT
Al Qaeda has modified its operational tactics and organisational structure, yet its core ideology remains intact. The group seems to be refraining from executing major attacks, especially in the West, to avoid repercussions and to allow its territorial expansion in East and West Africa to continue unhindered.
This strategic patience distinguishes Al Qaeda from the Islamic State’s approach in 2014-2017, when the latter simultaneously pursued territorial control while conducting high-profile international attacks — a strategy that ultimately drew overwhelming military response and territorial collapse.
Reports suggest that the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), the intelligence service of the Afghan Taliban, has a dedicated section for managing foreign terrorist entities in Afghanistan, including Al Qaeda. These entities are allegedly provided with security, accommodations, a monthly stipend and, in certain cases, even nationalities. Tajmir Jawad, the deputy director of GDI, is reportedly responsible for overseeing these foreign groups, primarily Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan.
If one conducts even a basic investigation, a fundamental factor would emerge as the principal reason for the rise and growth of all these Al Qaeda affiliates within their respective countries: weak states struggling with issues such as foreign intervention, inadequate governance, political exclusion, ongoing conflicts, and economic disparities, all of which provide a conducive environment for militant organisations to thrive.
 
 

With a robust ideological framework, these groups try to position themselves before the masses as an alternative to the current ruling class, which has not adequately addressed the people’s grievances over the years.
Although Al Qaeda’s central leadership may be weakened, its influence is expanding within the extremist landscape, as the territorial strength of its affiliates continues to grow across various regions, presenting a significant threat. These affiliates, which share strong ideological alignment with AQC but operate with a degree of autonomy, will furnish Al Qaeda’s core leadership with new avenues for funding, recruitment and operational bases, thereby allowing it to sustain a global presence.
A significant development in recent years has been the international acceptance and de facto diplomatic recognition of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, along with the formal diplomatic recognition and warm reception of the Ahmed Al-Sharaa-led government in Syria on the world stage (Al-Sharaa was once a member of AQI and headed the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra front). This may have established a precedent for Al Qaeda, suggesting that, if it were to seize control of a country, it could seek the same recognition and acceptance from the international community.
Such a scenario could prompt Al Qaeda to adopt a strategy that merges warfare with political manoeuvring to fulfil its objectives, rather than resorting to confrontation as it did after the 9/11 attacks.

The SCO is holding its Council of Heads of Government summit in Moscow from November 17 to 18. Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order.
“Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech in Moscow. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.”
 






He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal that “our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”.
The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space.
“Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region.
“Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said.
He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals.
This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”.
“An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.”
“Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said.
 






‘Youth empowerment of foremost importance’
Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy, and build human capital.
“While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said.
With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”.
“The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed.
 
 

“We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” the minister said.
He added that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect.
“Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.”
A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to Moscow.
 






Earlier this year, the SCO Council of Heads of State summit was held in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif raised the Indus Waters Treaty issue.
He also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date for it. Pakistan last hosted the SCO in 2024 for the Council of Heads of Government summit.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634229-dar-pushes-sco-to-activate-financial-tools-accelerate-economic-integration' target='_blank'><strong>Dar pushes SCO to activate financial tools, accelerate economic integration</strong></a><br><p>

A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan and a laboured chase later saw the hosts beat Sri Lanka by six wickets to complete a 3-0 series sweep over the visitors in the third and final ODI at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Babar was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for a Level 1 ICC Code of Conduct breach, which carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50pc of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.

“The 31-year-old has been found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to ‘abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match’,” ICC said in a press release.
One demerit point has been added to his disciplinary record, making it his first  in a 24-month period.
The incident occurred in the 21st over of Pakistan’s innings when Babar hit the stumps with his bat before leaving the crease following his dismissal (34 off 52) by Sri Lanka’s Jeffery Vandersay.
According to ICC,on-field umpires Alex Wharf and Rashid Riaz, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid and fourth umpire Faisal Afridi levelled the charge while Ali Naqvi of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees proposed the sanction.

The 27th Amendment was signed into law on November 13 after passage from the parliament amid strong criticism by the opposition parties. The legislation, which has brought major structural changes to the judiciary and the military, has been assailed by the legal fraternity, even former and sitting judges, as an “attack” on judicial independence.
In a meeting on Friday, the TTAP had vowed to vigorously protest to “restore the Constitution to its original form”.
Under a plan announced then, members of parties under the TTAP umbrella gathered outside Parliament House today to hold a protest. They then marched to the Supreme Court on Constitution Avenue.
TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI Senator Faisal Javed were at the forefront of the march, visuals shared by the TTAP on social media platform X showed.
“Battle will persist till the judiciary’s independence,” they chanted. TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai could be seen participating in the march as well.
 






At the protest outside Parliament House, visuals shared by the TTAP showed protesters holding banners that read “Death to dictatorship, long live democracy”, “27th Amendment rejected”, and “Subjugation of the judiciary is the public’s subjugation”.
Achakzai, Abbas, Raja, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser were among the key leaders present at the protest. Others included PTI MNAs Zain Qureshi and Junaid Akbar, Balochistan National Party-Mengal’s (BNP-M) Sajid Tareen, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry.
 






The gathered protesters chanted, “Aise dastoor ko nahi maantey, subh-i-be-nur ko nahi maantey” (we do not accept this constitution, we do not accept this morning bereft of light) — echoing Habib Jalib’s poetry, also used by opposition lawmakers in recent parliamentary sessions.
The TTAP leaders also raised slogans in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan, with some holding party flags.
 






National moot planned; ‘Black Day’ on Friday
Addressing the media, Achakzai announced that TTAP will organise a national conference on the 27th Amendment, where judges, lawyers, journalists, experts, and others will be invited.
The TTAP chief, as decided in the group’s Friday meeting, also announced that a “Black Day” will be observed on Friday (November 21) across the country in protest of the 27th Amendment.
He reiterated the TTAP’s objection to the lifetime immunities granted to the army chief and the president through the 27th Amendment, stressing that every person shall be held accountable for their actions under Islam.
Achakzai further said that even if a political party held a “100 per cent mandate” in the parliament, it could not change the “basic structure” of the Constitution of civilian supremacy. “The military, the judiciary, everyone will be independent in their functions, but they must be subservient to the elected parliament,” he asserted.
 






Speaking to reporters, Qaiser said the TTAP leadership, civil society, lawyers, mediapersons and other stakeholders will gather next week to formulate the future action plan.
In a post on X, Qaiser said protesters criticised the government for “disfiguring the unanimous Constitution of 1973 through force and horse-trading”. “We do not accept any 26th or 27th Amendment passed through the back as they fundamentally aim to bring the judiciary under the executive,” he added.
 






At the protest, Raja stressed that PTI lawmakers were the “representatives of the Pakistani public” and they rejected the new amendments, saying they were an “attack on the judiciary and the people”. “Your [and] my life, property, chaddor (honour), privacy — all has been taken away,” he claimed.
Yesterday, PTI MPAs held a walk from the Punjab Assembly to Charing Cross on The Mall to record their protest against the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Last week, the TTAP also said a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th Amendment.
The TTAP, formed in April last year, is a coalition of six opposition parties, including the PTI. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.</p><small>2025-11-18 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18070808c834b5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955653/pakistan-calls-for-ending-occupation-of-palestine-after-unsc-adopts-resolution-on-gaza-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for ending occupation of Palestine after UNSC adopts resolution on Gaza peace plan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad stressed on Monday the need for ending the occupation of Palestinian territories and paving the way for Palestinian statehood through a credible political process.
“We believe that in order to break the cycle of violence, it is absolutely necessary to end the occupation, and to have a political horizon, open the pathway to the Palestinian State through a credible, time-bound political process firmly anchored in the relevant UN resolutions,” he said while speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) after it adopt a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza.
The plan also authorises an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for the Palestinian enclave.
Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained — notable given earlier signals that Moscow might veto the text.
Israel and Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution approved by the Security Council is seen as vital to legitimising a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.
Pakistan said it voted in favour of the resolution in order to halt the fighting, protect civilians, and reinforce a ceasefire that could open the way to humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave.
Ambassador Ahmad explained that Islamabad backed the plan with one overriding purpose: “To stop the bloodshed, to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, to maintain the ceasefire, and to secure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.”
 






He said Pakistan’s vote was guided by the position of the Palestinians, the Arab Group, and the eight-nation Arab-Islamic grouping — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and Türkiye — which endorsed Trump’s initiative earlier this year.
“Our vote has been guided by the position of Palestine and the Arab Group,” he said, adding that the joint engagement was aimed at ending the conflict, ensuring humanitarian access, preventing displacement, and supporting “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
The ambassador noted that Pakistan worked actively during negotiations, supporting Arab amendments and proposing its own changes to ensure the text aligned with “international legitimacy” on the Palestinian question.
He welcomed the inclusion of some proposals, such as the explicit call for maintaining the ceasefire and the requirement for regular reporting to the UNSC, but said several critical issues remained unaddressed.
“A clear political path to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, the central role of the Palestinian Authority in governance and reconstruction, and enhanced involvement of the UN … are crucial aspects,” he said.
“We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity,” he added.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent policy that any peace initiative must lead to a sovereign, independent and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He underscored that existing UNSC resolutions “remain fully valid,” cautioning that the new resolution should not “alter or diminish” the body of established international law on the conflict.
He stressed that the right to self-determination is “inherent and unconditional … and cannot be subjected to any conditions”.
The ambassador said the proposed Board of Peace must remain a temporary oversight mechanism whose mandate expires in 2027 unless renewed.
“Executive and administrative authority in Gaza must remain with the Palestinians through a Palestinian Committee,” he added.
He insisted that the Palestinian Authority must play a central role in governance and reconstruction.
“Peace cannot be achieved by bypassing the Palestinians. There must be an end to policies that undermine and weaken the Palestinian Authority,“ he said.
Talking about the ISF, Ahmad said it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority.
He warned that unilateral violations of the ceasefire could “threaten and thwart the entire process”, and emphasised that the ISF’s mandate would only be effective “once there is complete Israeli withdrawal”.
Referring to the scale of devastation in Gaza, the ambassador said more than 69,000 Palestinians had been killed over the past two years.
A “ray of hope,” he said, had emerged with the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh in October — where Egypt, Qatar, Türkiye and the United States signed the peace agreement that underpins the current plan.
The UN envoy urged the international community to uphold its responsibilities and support a credible, time-bound process towards Palestinian statehood. He stressed that there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement” and that the territorial contiguity of the West Bank and Gaza was essential for a viable state.
 
 

Looking ahead, he said the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people must play central roles in governance, reconstruction and institution-building.
At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people.
“Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation.
In a post on X afterwards, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “Looking ahead, the central roles of the United Nations, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people are vital in ensuring legitimate governance, reconstruction, and institution building in Gaza.
“The international community must stand with them steadfastly and firmly.”
 






Adoption of the resolution
The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.
It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.
Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution.
Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass.
After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision a “historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region.
“Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely.
He emphasised that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.”
Hamas rejects resolution
Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.
 
 

“Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught, sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023.
The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced.
That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel.
“Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.</p><small>2025-11-18 10:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634206-ttap-stages-rally-against-27th-amendment-says-all-roads-to-justice-closed-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP stages rally against 27th Amendment, says all roads to justice closed in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Following these changes, Supreme Court’s  Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has been included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while Federal Constitutional Court’s (FCC)  Justice Aamer Farooq has been made a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
Changes in their composition were required to synchronise them with the latest constitutional amendment.
A Supreme Court (SC) press release issued on Tuesday said: “Pursuant to the 27th Constitutional Amendment, [these] key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies […] have been reconstituted in accordance with the revised constitutional framework.”
Elaborating on the changes in the bodies’ composition, the press release said that Justice Mandokahail, being the second-most senior judge of the SC, had been jointly nominated by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan as a member of the SJC.
Now, apart from Justice Mandokhail, the SJC will comprise the CJP, FCC CJ Aminuddin, Justice Munib Akhtar of the SC, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi of the FCC, Lahore High Court (LHC) CJ Aalia Neelum and Islamabad High Court (IHC) CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
According to the 27th Amendment, the SJC will be headed by the senior most judge between the CJP and FCC chief justice. The inter-se seniority in this case will be determined by the dates of their appointment as the chief justices of the SC and FCC. This means that CJP Yahya will continue to head the body.
The SC press release also added that the two judges had nominated Justice Mandokhail as a member of Practice and Procedure Committee.
Under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Act 2023, the three-judge committee will now comprise the CJP, Justice Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail, who has become the second-most senior judge following the resignation of Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
According to the SC press release, Justice Farooq, the second most senior judge of the FCC, was jointly nominated by the chief justices of the SC and FCC as a member of the JCP.
Following this, the JCP will now comprise the CJP, FCC chief justice, Justice Akhtar, FCC’s Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members from the National Assembly, two members from the Senate and a woman or non-Muslim nominated by the National Assembly speaker.
“The reconstituted bodies will continue to play a central role in matters of accountability, judicial appointments, and procedural governance under the amended constitutional scheme,” the press release read.
The changes in the bodies’ composition come amid a restructuring of the judiciary following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the FCC, was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry. It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethroning the SS as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Hours after the Amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC had resigned, citing their reservations against it. These two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
ICJ’s reservations
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has also expressed concern over several main points of the Amendment, namely the formation of the FCC, the appointment of judges and chief justices to the SC and the FCC, the composition of the JCP, the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the (ICJ) statement issued on Nov 13 read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-18 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1813292666f5af1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955835/girl-18-found-dead-in-dha-karachi-relatives-detained-for-suspected-involvement' target='_blank'><strong>Girl, 18, found dead in DHA Karachi; relatives detained for suspected involvement</strong></a><br><p>A newlywed 18-year-old girl was found dead in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area while the police detained her relatives for their suspected involvement for interrogation, officials said on Tuesday.
“The girl was married to a government employee deputed at Malir Cantonment; she was found dead at the rooftop of a building in Badar Commercial in Phase 5,” South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
The senior officer added that a dupatta was knotted around her neck twice.
She was immediately taken to a private clinic in DHA and later to a hospital in Clifton, where doctors pronounced her dead. Subsequently, DIG Raza detailed, her body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal proceedings.
The couple had arrived in Karachi from Sialkot two weeks ago and was residing at an aunt’s house in the Badar Commercial area.
According to details shared by the DIG, the girl reportedly went to the rooftop on Monday evening and did not return.
When her aunt went upstairs, she found the girl unconscious near a water tank with her neck knotted with a dupatta. She called her son and went to the hospital.
The father of the deceased girl (who is also a government employee) arrived at JPMC on Monday night and alleged that it was a murder by strangulation.
“The aunt’s sons are found suspects in this case and detained for interrogation,” said the senior officer.
The South police head said they are waiting for the doctors’ final report.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “We have strong suspicions about sexual violence,” adding that all samples have been collected. She said the cause of death was constriction of the neck.</p><small>2025-11-18 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634196-ajks-youngest-pm-who-is-raja-faisal-rathore' target='_blank'><strong>AJK's youngest PM: Who is Raja Faisal Rathore?</strong></a><br><p>

The woman, formerly Sikh, had come to Pakistan for religious purposes but had converted to Islam to marry the second petitioner, her now-husband. She complained that the police had conducted an “illegal raid on their house in Farooqabad, Sheikhupura district, and pressured her to end the marriage.”
The petition was heard by Justice Farooq Haider, who ordered the police to stop harassing the petitioners.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was filed on November 12 under Article 199 (jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution. It named both the woman and her husband as the petitioners and Punjab’s inspector general of police (IGP), the regional police officer of Sheikhupura, the district police officers (DPOs) of Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib, the station house officers (SHOs) of the same, and another resident of Farooq Abad as respondents.
The petition alleged that, based on the woman’s former religion, this other resident had requested the SHOs to conduct an illegal raid on the petitioners’ home twice, on November 8 and 11. It said the SHOs caused “undue harassment towards them” and forced them to dissolve the marriage.
The petition added, “The police functionaries are duty-bound to provide legal protection as guaranteed by Article 35 of the Constitution … the state is duty-bound to protect the life and liberty of spouses.” In addition to Article 35 (protection of family, etc), it also cited Article 9 (security of person) to argue that no person should be deprived of life or liberty except in accordance with the law.
It also said that the husband was a citizen of Pakistan, while his wife had also approached the embassy to extend her visa and obtain Pakistani nationality.
The petition submitted that the respondents’ actions were “against the law and fundamental rights” and severely infringed on the petitioners’ rights. It added that the petitioners would suffer “irreparable loss and injury” if the court did not issue a proper direction restraining the respondents from causing undue harassment.
It requested the LHC to “graciously” direct the respondents not to cause undue harassment to the petitioners and “not to interfere [with] the matrimonial life of the petitioners”, as well as any other relief the court deemed fit.
A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in August found an alarming rise in violence against religious minorities during the last year, including the targeted killing of Ahmadis and extra-judicial killings by the police of those accused of blasphemy. The HRCP underscored the urgent need for reform within law enforcement and accountability mechanisms.</p><small>2025-11-18 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634189-newlywed-girl-found-hanging-at-residence-in-karachis-dha' target='_blank'><strong>Newlywed girl found hanging at residence in Karachi's DHA</strong></a><br><p>

The report, published on Tuesday by AidData, a research lab at US university William & Mary, said China’s lending and grant giving totalled $2.2 trillion across 200 countries in every region of the world from 2000 to 2023.
During this period, Pakistan received $74 billion, the report shows, ranking it as the fifth largest recipient.
China has long been seen as a creditor to developing countries through its Belt and Road initiative, but is shifting toward lending to advanced economies — backing strategic infrastructure and high‑tech supply chains in areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and clean energy.
Beijing’s portfolio size is two-to-four times larger than previous estimates suggest, AidData said, adding that China remains the world’s largest official creditor.
More than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now support projects and activities in upper-middle-income countries and high-income countries.
“Much of the lending to wealthy countries is focused on critical infrastructure, critical minerals and the acquisition of high-tech assets like semiconductor companies,” said lead author Brad Parks, AidData’s executive director.
The United States received the most official sector credit from China, more than $200bn for nearly 2,500 projects and activities, the report said.
Chinese state-owned entities are “active in every corner and sector of the US”, bankrolling the construction of liquefied natural gas projects in Texas and Louisiana, data centres in Northern Virginia, terminals at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the Matterhorn Express Natural Gas pipeline and the Dakota Access Oil pipeline, AidData said.
Beijing has financed the acquisition of high-tech companies while Chinese state-owned creditors have provided credit facilities for many Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, AT&T, Verizon, Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Boeing and Disney, the report said.
The share of lending to low and lower-middle income countries fell to 12 per cent in 2023 from 88pc in 2000.
Beijing has also cut lending for infrastructure projects in the “Global South”, under its Belt and Road Initiative.
At the same time, it has ramped up its share that supports middle-income and high-income countries to 76pc in 2023 from 24pc in 2000. The United Kingdom, for instance, received $60bn, while the European Union got $161bn.</p><small>2025-11-18 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18114728d926e01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955828/terrorist-killed-in-failed-attempt-to-blow-up-bridge-in-bannu-after-ied-detonates-prematurely' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist killed in failed attempt to blow up bridge in Bannu after IED detonates prematurely</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists’ bid to blow up a bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district failed on Tuesday when an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated prematurely while it was being installed, police said.
Amir Khan, the spokesperson for the District Police Office in Bannu, told Dawn that two terrorists intended to blow up Doghoda Bridge. He said that one of them died on the spot when the IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.
The other terrorist was injured and escaped the scene, he added.
The spokesperson said police had reached the spot and were collecting evidence. Meanwhile, the process for the identification of the dead terrorist had also been initiated, he said.
A search operation was also under way to track down the other terrorist, he added.
Today’s incident comes around a month after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Bannu.
According to police, terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance in the October 19 incident.
But, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement, preventing the terrorists from coming near the police station. Eventually, the terrorists fled, a police statement said.
In a similar incident on October 17, three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Bannu late at night.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1811041743e27aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955824/vitol-cnergyico-make-pakistans-biggest-single-delivery-of-marine-fuel' target='_blank'><strong>Vitol, Cnergyico make Pakistan’s biggest single delivery of marine fuel</strong></a><br><p>Vitol and Cnergyico, Pakistan’s largest oil refiner, have delivered the country’s biggest single shipment of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for ship refuelling, the global trading firm said in a statement late Monday.
The move will enable large vessels refuelling in Pakistan to now sail longer routes from east to west without needing to stop elsewhere, while also giving the country a stronger local supply of environmentally compliant marine fuel.
This shipment came from Cnergyico’s first large-scale batch of fuel that meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) low-sulphur rules. The company began producing it after importing its first US crude oil cargoes earlier this year.
Vitol delivered the VLSFO to a vessel owned and operated by shipping major MSC at Port Qasim, using a Singapore-flagged bunker barge Marine Ista that has the capacity to supply 6,800 metric tons of marine fuel in a single delivery.
It was also the first barge to load fuel directly from the Karachi Port Trust’s Oil Pier rather than through truck deliveries.
Cnergyico will continue providing Vitol with this cleaner marine fuel, according to Vitol.
“This latest initiative enhances Pakistan’s capacity to serve the global shipping industry with sustainable fuel solutions,” said Aumar Abbassciy, director at Cnergyico Pk Limited.

The party has challenged the notification issued on Oct 24 by interior ministry that placed the party in the First Schedule of proscribed organisations under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal in this regard was ratified by the federal cabinet.
Since the party under the regulations has the right to appeal to a review committee comprising interior and law ministry officers within 30 days, the TLP moved the appeal before the expiry of the deadline.
 
 

The petition argues the SRO No 2011(I)/2025 was issued without due consideration of earlier administrative and legal actions. It contains supporting documents annexed with the application including the 2021 notification of proscription, its restoration as a political entity by the ECP, the subsequent notification removing TLP from the proscribed list, and an ‘agreement’ between the federal government and the party.
Advocates Burhan Moazzam Malik and Sajjad Akbar Abbasi, who filed the application, maintain the ministry’s latest move contradicts earlier commitments of the government and established legal processes. The interior ministry is expected to examine the petition and accompanying record before deciding to uphold, amend, or withdraw the October notification. If the petition is rejected, the TLP has the right to move the apex court.

• Seven courtrooms arranged on IHC floors
• Three benches hear several cases on first working day
ISLAMABAD: After the swearing-in of two more judges, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) finally commenced operations on Monday, hearing a number of cases within the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises.
The day began with the oath-taking ceremony of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah inside the conference room on the ground floor of the IHC building on Constitution Avenue. The oath was administered by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, bringing the court’s existing strength to seven judges.

Earlier, the FCC chief justice had told the media that the total sanctioned strength of the court would be 13 judges. Seven courtrooms have been arranged for FCC judges on different floors of the IHC building.
After the ceremony, the formal proceedings commenced with the recitation of the Holy Quran at the main FCC courtroom situated on the first floor. Since the FCC’s arrangements are not yet complete, IHC Courtroom No. 2 has been converted into the main courtroom of the FCC chief justice, with a printed A-4 page affixed at the entrance to designate it as such.
Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar will continue holding court in his original Courtroom No. 1, located above the FCC’s main courtroom.
Formal proceedings began at 10:12am, with Bench-I hearing around five cases in half an hour. During the hearing, those present in the courtroom could hear discomforting sounds such as the dragging of furniture.
“With the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) refusing to hand over its building, and the FCC already reeling from myriad teething problems due to sharing its establishment with the IHC, this is the only court in the country without a formal building of its own,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity. He added that even the rooms allocated for law officers have yet to be refurbished.
He further confided that there was a strong possibility that the IHC may revert to its old G-10 premises early next year, possibly in January, since litigants face difficulties entering the Red Zone to pursue their cases. The move would also ease logistical issues for lawyers who must shuttle between the district courts and the high court to file bail applications, appeals, etc.
There is also a possibility that a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) may be called soon to consider the confirmation of Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, who was elevated as an acting judge of the Supreme Court on Feb 14 this year.
The counsel also disclosed that during hearings in one FCC courtroom, a lawyer was told that the FCC should be their first priority and that they should appear before it before attending cases at the Supreme Court.
Cases’ hearing
On Monday, three different FCC benches heard cases. Bench-I comprised FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah. Bench-II included Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, while Bench-III consisted of Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech.
Meanwhile, Bench-I, while taking up a case relating to the change of status of an amenity plot, stayed the Aug 26, 2025 Sindh High Court judgement and issued notices to various respondents, adjourning further proceedings until Nov 27.
Declaring the matter a public-interest case, the FCC also directed the SHC not to proceed with a contempt of court case against the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which some respondents had moved before the high court.
The KMC, through its mayor, had challenged the SHC decision that declared void and illegal the corporation’s May 19 resolution allowing public-private partnership agreements under rental arrangements to initiate commercial activities on nine different amenity plots.
In the first round of litigation, the petitioners had questioned the conversion of nine Karachi amenity plots into sports grounds for commercial use, for which exorbitant usage fees were being charged.
The plots include Jheel Park, Hill Park, Umer Sharif Park, Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim, KMC Sports Complex, Hosh Muhammad Sheedi Park, St-4 Clifton Block 2, St-15 Clifton Block 1, and St-19 Clifton Block 1.
The petitioners argued that the SHC judgement was unwarranted in law and had created an administrative and executive vacuum. They contended that the verdict was based on presumptions and relied on precedents not applicable to the present issue. Most importantly, they argued, it failed to consider the contours of public purpose as presently relevant to ground realities.

The latest data issued by the State Bank on Monday showed that the country posted a CAD of $733 million in July-October compared with $206m in the same period last year. Another vital change was that October posted a $112m deficit, compared with a $83m surplus in September.
The pressure on the current account is directly related to higher imports, while the exports remained stagnant during the current fiscal year. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the government had relaxed import curbs.
The government is under severe criticism for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years, and financial circles believe it was a deliberate attempt to cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn in FY25, but economic growth remained at 2.6pc, which was later revised to 3pc.

Rising imports and falling exports contributed to poor performance

Experts have been advising the government to ease import restrictions to boost economic growth, as the country has an import-led growth model.
The data shows that imports of goods and services during the first four months of the current fiscal year rose to $24.919bn, up from $22.647bn in the same period last year. However, the export did not show any significant change as the total stood at $13.664bn during July-October compared to $13.041bn in the same period of FY25.
The trade deficit during the 4 months of the current fiscal year was $11.255bn compared to $9.606bn in the same period of FY25.
Despite the higher current account deficit, other external account indicators are supportive of the government. Remittances in October totalled $3.4bn, up from $3.2bn in the preceding month. Overall remittances, compared to last year, increased during the 4 months, which was against policymakers’ expectations. The government expects to receive $40bn remittances in FY26.
At the same time, the expected inflow of $1.2bn from the IMF under the EFF and RSF programmes, and support from the United States for investment, have changed sentiment towards Pakistan. Some analysts believe remittances will rise as a result of the defence pact with Saudi Arabia.
“The current account deficit is the key to the stability of the external account of the country and a basic need for higher foreign exchange reserves that stabilises the exchange rate,” said an analyst. He said that if the current account deficit persists in the first half of the fiscal FY26, it would be damaging to both the economy and the country.
