The latest military exchange between the arch-rivals began when Israel struck Iran’s nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top commanders and scientists. Tel Aviv has said it wants to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

Latest developments:

8 new deaths in Israel take toll to 23; Tehran says 224 killed in Iran so far, with over 1,000 injured
Fire seen at power plant near Israel’s Haifa port; residential buildings destroyed near US Embassy branch in Tel Aviv
Iran president reiterates Tehran does not seek nuclear weapons
Trump reportedly vetoed plan to target Khamenei; Netanyahu claims Iran tried to assassinate US president twice
3 more Iranian commanders killed; Tehran hangs man on charges of spying for Mossad


Dangers of further escalation loomed over a meeting of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.
“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,” Katz wrote on X.
 


The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel’s national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.
Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by Anadolu Agency.
More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour said on X.
At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel’s strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.
Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.
Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.
 


Israel’s military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.
It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.
Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred meters from the US Embassy branch in the city.
The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.
British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port, Reuters reported.

Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.
An AFP journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an AFP journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.
 
 

Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.
The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.
A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.
Iran does not seek nuclear weapons: president
Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s religious edict against weapons of mass destruction.
Iran had claimed the existence of the fatwa for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.
While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity “more than ever” against the Israeli aggression, Press TV reported.

Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation’s interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.
“We have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations — for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,” he further said.
The president said the US violated international norms by “allowing” Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.
“The enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,” Pezeshkian said.
“For every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,” he added.
On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel’s attacks, Pezeshkian asked: “What crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?”
More commanders killed in Iran
General Mohammad Kazemi, the intelligence chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), his deputy Gen Hassan Mohaqqeq, and Gen Mohsen Baqeri were among those killed in Israel’s attacks on Sunday, the IRGC said.
 


The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.
Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran’s holy city of Mashhad in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.
Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.
Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.
“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.
According to AFP, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.
“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.
His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.
Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported AFP.
The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official Fars news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.
The execution is the third in recent weeks related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.
Iranian media, including Tasnim, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.
‘I will not leave’
In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.
“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.
“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”
Some, however, were determined to stay.
“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told AFP.
AFP images from Israel’s Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.
 






The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.
Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.
“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.
“It was a miracle we survived.”
Trump vetoes plan to target Khamenei: report
In Washington, two US officials told Reuters that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told AFP.
When asked about the Reuters report, Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”
“We do what we need to do,” he told Fox’s ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’.
Asked whether regime change in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.
In the same interview, The Independent reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice “through proxies”.
“Through their intel, yes; they want to kill him,” he added. “He’s enemy number one,” the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.
Trump has lauded Israel’s offensive but said Washington had nothing to do with it, while threatening to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.
However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully coordinated”.
Trump has urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to fight it out” first.
He told ABC News on Sunday that he would be “open” to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator. “It’s possible we could get involved” in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.
Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported the same.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.
He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”. “If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.
Iran scrapped planned nuclear talks with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.</p><small>2025-06-16 09:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16142239a4c89bb.jpg?r=142255' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917482/body-formed-to-monitor-oil-volatility-amid-iran-israel-war-says-pakistan-has-adequate-petroleum-stocks' target='_blank'><strong>Body formed to monitor oil volatility amid Iran-Israel war says Pakistan has adequate petroleum stocks</strong></a><br><p>A committee formed In response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel’s recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets held its first meeting on Monday, wherein it expressed satisfaction that Pakistan currently holds adequate stocks of petroleum products.
According to a Finance Division statement, the committee chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb conducted a detailed assessment of the global and domestic petroleum market situation and noted that there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.
Nonetheless, the committee’s members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.
To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.
The petroleum division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee’s mandate, the statement added.
The prime minister had formed the committee to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Besides the finance minister, it also includes senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts.
The Finance Division said the formation of this committee reflects the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.
The committee has been entrusted to closely monitor the price of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region.
It will determine forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term, suggest a plan, if required, to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied, and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact in the event of a protracted conflict.
The statement said the government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time.
Global oil prices were volatile on Monday, after surging seven per cent on Friday, as renewed strikes by Israel and Iran over the weekend increased concerns that the battle could widen across the region and significantly disrupt oil exports from the Middle East, Reuters reported.
Brent crude futures were up 6 cents, or 0.08pc, to $74.29 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 21 cents or 0.29pc, to $73.19. They had surged more than $4 a barrel earlier in the session and also fell into negative territory briefly.</p><small>2025-06-16 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16140746fe72a88.jpg?r=141010' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917326/merchants-of-war-why-did-israel-attack-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Merchants of war: Why did Israel attack Iran?</strong></a><br><p>In April, President Trump told journalists in the Oval Office that he was pretty confident there would be a deal with Iran “without having to start dropping bombs all over the place”. A little more than a month later, Israel is doing exactly that — dropping bombs all over the place.
It is now clear that the bait for surprising the Persians was dialogue with the US; talks that were cancelled and rescheduled to allow the Israelis to attack, and that Trump was playing his role in this deception.
Meanwhile, the West offers pathetic platitudes to de-escalation but sends jets to Israel, the glorified petrol stations of the Gulf look on with feigned concern as Israel does their bidding, and non-Arab states like Pakistan avert their gaze haplessly as Tehran is ravaged by bombs battle-tested on Palestinians. It is only Iran that stands against Israel, and it stands completely alone.
Cast in the same mould
Iran and Israel are surprisingly alike. Both countries are nestled among neighbours they believe are hostile to them, both are religiously distinct, and both believe themselves to be culturally and intellectually superior to the Arabs. In his brilliant book, Treacherous Alliance, political analyst Trita Parsi notes that theirs is a nemesis born of affinity. The Iranians and Israelis, he says, often think as they go about their daily lives that “the Arabs are out to get us.” The hate it seems is returned; the title of a book by Khairallah Tulfah, Saddam Hussein’s maternal uncle is, ‘Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews and Flies’.
The Israeli disdain for the Arabs is evident, “we know what the Arabs can do, and it isn’t much,” an Israeli analyst told Parsi, but while Israeli officials saw themselves as culturally superior to their Arab neighbours, they saw Iran as an equal. And this view, it seems, was shared by the Persians, leading them into an unlikely alliance with Israel during the Iran-Iraq war, where Israel helped the Iranians, ironically bombing the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981 in collaboration with Iran. It was only after Iran defeated Iraq (in a war in which almost the whole international community, including the US, sided with Iraq), that both states, in their aspiration for regional hegemony in the Middle East, turned from allies to enemies.
The most important similarity between both nations is their fundamental belief that they can’t rely on anybody but themselves. While this is true for the Iranians, it is less true for Israel which is the golden calf of the only superpower in the world.
In spite of this, its persecution complex after the Holocaust means Israelis inherently still believe they must stand on their own. It is this mindset that has led each to pursue its own military and economic development, a pursuit most difficult for Iran which has been strangled by sanctions that have left it out in the cold.
It is this formidable rivalry which leads to the two states being at war today. The animosity between them is not born out of enmity, but competition. Israel sees in Iran a state it aims to destroy, not because it is worried that its ‘black-turbaned fundamental clerics’ will get the bomb, but because it sees in Iran a worthy adversary.
 
 

A nuclear Iran
Under international law, of course, Israel’s actions are completely unlawful. While some attempt has been made to pay lip service to the notion of self-defence, this is against a far-fetched threat which may materialise if Iran were to get nuclear weapons.
It was in fact Israel’s strike on the Osirak reactor that solidified opposition to this form of self-defence in the international community. Preventive self-defence, against threats which are not imminent, are illegal acts of aggression, though Israel remains protected by America’s veto from a Security Council resolution calling for an end to its strikes.
Moreover, the targeted assassinations of Iran’s nuclear scientists are indeed war crimes, as they are civilians who cannot be made the object of attack. If the laws of war were enlarged to include scientists working on nuclear programmes, every scientist or engineer working on the Manhattan Project would have been targetable.
While it is an open secret that Israel has nuclear weapons even though it cries wolf over Iran’s attempt to enrich uranium, the old joke in diplomatic circles is that Iran has supposedly been weeks away from getting the bomb for the last 30 years.
This time was no different; the acquisition of nuclear weapons was imminent, said Netanyahu, waving around a resolution from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  which holds Iran in breach of its obligations. This is despite the fact that Iran strategically has always desired a Middle East free of nuclear weapons, as it would enjoy conventional supremacy as one of the largest states in the region. However, the failure of the Iranians has been their ever willingness to talk.
In 2003, after the Americans occupied Baghdad and fearing they were next, the Iranians sent the most compromising proposal possible to the United States in which they put everything on the table. They offered to end their support for the Palestinian resistance and pursue the Pakistan/ Malaysian model, under which they would not recognise Israel but would stop arming the non-state groups fighting against the occupation. They also offered to disarm Hezbollah and make it a political party, and most importantly, they offered to give up entirely their nuclear programme and open it up to intrusive international scrutiny.
In return, there would be an end to sanctions that had crippled the country’s economy and stymied its development. It should have been a no-brainer but it wasn’t. US Vice President, Dick Cheney, and Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, shut it down saying “we don’t speak to evil”. Compared to America’s neo-conservative war hawks, the Ayatollahs are more flexible.
As a result, Iran had to ideologically commit to confronting the US-led order and it did so by championing the Palestinian cause, arming armed groups directly, with few strings attached. It also continued to enrich uranium, as it is allowed to do, to meet its energy needs.
Two years after Iran’s proposal to the US, when asked how far Israel would go to stop Iran’s nuclear programme, Dan Halutz, Israel’s Chief of General Staff, said “two thousand kilometres”, the distance between Israel and Iran.
If it wasn’t clear then, it should be now. Iran absolutely must have nuclear weapons if it is to ward off any future Israeli threats. While it can quote international law by the yard, the UN Charter cannot do what nuclear warheads can. Iran must have the bomb.
 
 

How does this end?
Regime change in Iran has been on the cards for decades. General Wesley Clark, former commander of Nato and US presidential hopeful in 2003, claimed that he had met with a senior military officer in 2001 who told him that the Bush administration was planning to attack seven Muslim majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia and Sudan. Almost all of those countries have either had their leaders toppled in direct or indirect military intervention by the West, all except Iran.
Almost two decades ago, Netanyahu believed the US didn’t even need a military incursion to achieve this goal. In 2002, he told a US congressional committee meeting that regime change in Iran could be affected through transmitting US TV shows into Iran’s satellite TV network, “because that is subversive stuff … the young kids watch it.. they wanna have nice clothes and the same houses and swimming pools …”
Today, as bombs rain on Tehran, there are two ways this conflict can go. Iran can continue to send its missiles to Israel for long enough that the war becomes unpopular with the Israeli public and Russian and Chinese diplomats intervene to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Or, the Iranian regime cannot hold and it will fall.
If it does, Israel will install itself in Iran, allowing a puppet regime that offers no resistance to itself or the Saudis. The Gulf states and Israel may then allow there to be an emasculated, demilitarised, and supervised Palestinian state which will be a state only in name, with Israel controlling its borders and foreign policy, and continuing its military presence in the country. They will say this is a victory for peace, a victory for the Middle East, a victory for Muslims.
 
 

In the meantime, Iran, as of now unbowed and undefeated, fights on.
“Indeed, Pharaoh elevated himself in the land, and made its people into factions, persecuting a sect, slaughtering its sons and sparing its women. Indeed, he was one of the corrupters. But We willed that We would favor those who were downtrodden in the land, making them leaders and heirs.” — Qur’an 28:4-5

The incident comes days after an Air India flight to London, using the same type of Boeing aircraft, crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad moments after take-off, killing 241 of the 242 people on board.
The Dreamliner aircraft flying Air India flight AI315 out of Hong Kong on Monday is now undergoing checks, said the source.
AI315 made a return to Hong Kong International Airport and requested local standby at around 1pm, then “landed safely at around 1:15pm”, the spokesperson of Airport Authority Hong Kong said.
The airport operations were not affected, the spokesperson added.
Flight AI315 took off from Hong Kong at around 12:20pm and landed just around an hour later.
It reached an altitude of 22,000 feet and then started descending, according to flight tracking website AirNav Radar. The plane was seven years old.
Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Hong Kong-New Delhi flight.

Tehran has hit back with strikes against Israel since it unleashed waves of attacks against Iran on Friday, sparking global alarm that the conflict could erupt into a regional war.
New Delhi, which has relations with both countries, has sought to relocate its citizens within Iran after Tehran closed its airspace.
“The Indian Embassy in Tehran is continuously monitoring the security situation and engaging Indian students in Iran to ensure their safety,” a foreign ministry statement said.
“In some cases, students are being relocated with [the] Embassy’s facilitation to safer places within Iran,” the ministry added.
 






There are around 10,000 Indian citizens in Iran, according to government data last year, while figures from 2022 listed more than 2,000 students in Iran.
New Delhi on Friday said it stood ready “to extend all possible support” to both countries, as it urged them to “avoid any escalatory steps”.
 
 

“Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised,” said foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal.
Iran’s health ministry has reported at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israeli authorities have tallied more than a dozen deaths since Tehran began its retaliatory attacks Friday.</p><small>2025-06-16 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16122002d5b0021.jpg?r=123253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Trump, Netanyahu viral comments about Pakistan on Iran-Israel clash are fake</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users on multiple social media platforms since Sunday shared a clip of US President Donald Trump allegedly urging Pakistan to stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. However, the viral clip is AI-generated and Trump said no such thing.
Nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13. Iran subsequently launched its own retaliation with ballistic missiles fired at Israel and the two countries continued to exchange a volley over the weekend.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed “complete solidarity” with Iran while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that Pakistan would “safeguard Iran’s interests” amid the conflict.
On Sunday, an X user posted a clip of Trump apparently commenting on the rising Middle East tensions, urging Pakistan to stay out of a potential Israel-Iran conflict.
In the clip he said: “Pakistan has also warned Israel and the US, because Israel mistakenly said Pakistan is number two after Iran. Pakistan is fully alert with its air, land and marine forces. Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said if Israel attacks Iran again, Pakistan will totally destroy Israel.
“But Harry’s, would I say Pakistan should not do that? Pakistan has no problem with us, their army is already very high alert. In my opinion, Pakistan should not get involved. This is Israel and Iran’s war. We need peace in the region. We need to stop the fighting, not get in the middle. That’s the truth. That’s a smart move.”
The post was viewed by over 620,000 people.
The video with the same claim was shared here gaining 246,000 views.
It was also shared on TikTok here, here, and here, racking up 2.6 million, 1.6m and 14,000 views, respectively.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality, keen public interest in the situation and widespread rumours about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict.
Observing the clip showed several discrepancies, indicative of videos generated through AI, such as unnatural blinking, distorted facial expressions, robotic-sounding speech lacking a natural cadence and ebb and flow. Furthermore, the word “region” was unnaturally uttered in an extended manner at the 34-second mark of the clip.
Examining the video using AI detection tools showed that Hive Moderation flagged it with a 98.2 per cent likelihood of AI generation, while Attestive.ai reported only a 7pc probability. Deepware did not detect the video as a deepfake.
 


A keyword search  for “Donald Trump”, “Iran” and “Pakistan” yielded no recent results or reports from credible US media outlets on the alleged comments.
A reverse image search traced the clip to Trump’s May 30 address from the White House Oval Office — well before the current Israel-Iran escalation, which began on June 13.
 


 


Furthermore, the US president has made no other public speech in his office since June 13.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim about a viral video of Trump urging Pakistan to stay out of Israel-Iran conflict is false. The clip is a deepfake and Trump has made no such comment.
Netanyahu’s ‘threat’ to Pakistan
Posts from users on social media platforms since Saturday shared a video of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming that he threatened Pakistan, saying his goal is to prevent Iran and Pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons amid the current Israel-Iran conflict. However, the statement is not recent or related to the ongoing conflict but was made in March 2011 where he conditioned his comment about Pakistan to a Taliban takeover and was not a direct threat.
On Saturday, a post on X by a user, describing himself as a journalist associated with a major news outlet, shared a video of Netanyahu with the following caption: “After Iran, Pakistan … Netanyahu’s threat.”
In the video, Netanyahu can be heard saying: “The greatest mission that we have is to prevent the militant Islamic regime from meeting up with nuclear weapons — or from nuclear weapons meeting up with the Islamic regime. The first is called Iran, and the second is called Pakistan. Because if these radical regimes have nuclear weapons, they will not obey the rules that have been obeyed in the last almost seven decades.”
The post was seen by more than 204,000 people and reshared 1,000 times.
The same video was also shared by multiple other X users, gaining over 77,000, 24,000, and 11,000 views, respectively.
The claim also circulated widely across platforms, appearing in additional posts on X here, here and here and on Facebook as well.
A similar claim was also shared in a text post on Instagram, which received more than 13,000 likes.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.
A keyword search for “Netanyahu,” “Pakistan” and “statement” yielded to a YouTube video of an interview aired on March 31, 2011, by Israeli news outlet Channel 2 and thus unrelated to the current tensions.
 


Reviewing the full 27-minute interview showed that Netanyahu made the remarks at the 25:43-minute mark.
However, the viral clip had slightly altered Netanyahu’s remarks since in the original, he said the following about Pakistan at the 26:04-minute mark: “The second is called Pakistan, or more specifically a Taliban takeover of Pakistan.”
His comment was specifying Pakistan to a scenario in which it was taken over by the Taliban, however this part of his comment was edited out from the viral clip. Thus, there was no direct threat from Netanyahu to the Pakistani state amid the recent conflict or even in his original comments.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows Israeli PM Netanyahu threatening Pakistan and saying his goal is to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons is false.
The viral clip is from 2011, unrelated to the current conflict and does not have a direct threat to Pakistan with Netanyahu conditioning his comment about preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons to a possible Taliban takeover of Pakistan, with this part edited out of the viral clip.

Ladha assistant commissioner Shadman Safi said the incident occurred when the soldier, Lance Naik Iqbal Khan, was on duty. “Armed men opened fire on him without warning, resulting in his death on the spot. Despite retaliatory fire by the security forces, the attackers managed to escape from the scene,” he added.
Meanwhile, a police official was martyred when terrorists attacked a checkpost in Ghiljo area of Orakzai district on Saturday night.
Sub-divisional police officer Mehboob Khan told Dawn that an unknown number of terrorists surrounded the police post at around 9.40pm and started indiscriminate fire at it, which was duly retaliated by the personnel, and the exchange of fire continued for about an hour.
During the fierce skirmish, a sub-inspector Inayatullah hailing from Kohat district was martyred. The terrorists later fled into the mountains. However, a search operation was launched for the fleeing outlaws.
Mehboob Khan said it could not be ascertained as to from where and how many militants attacked the post.
“The policemen were taken by surprise because it was prayer time.”
It may be recalled that it was the second attack at the same post in a month. The body of the martyred police inspector was taken to a hospital for autopsy.
On Sunday, his funeral prayers were offered at the police lines in Kalaya.

The country’s descent to the bottom 148th rank, with a gender parity mark slipping from last year’s 57pc to 56.7pc, is an unsettling comment on how male-centric narratives and cultural mores push women into a social void.
The report claims that this year’s results record a second consecutive dip from the best economic score of 57.7pc in 2023, while Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity sank by 1.3pc.
A closer look at the four key indices reveals that Pakistan’s was a downward slope on the performance graph: it came in at 147 in economic participation and opportunity — women constitute a dismal 25pc of the formal labour force — and 137 in educational attainment — the sole indication of progress as educational parity rose by 1.5pc though that is partially attributed to a decline in male enrolment in tertiary education.
 
 

In health and survival, we rank 131, and 118 in political empowerment. Our imbalanced scorecard in the main gauges that power development and prosperity reflect the shallowness of political claims.
The blame for this state of affairs falls on successive governments who failed to create protective systems, reframe patriarchal discourse, or respect the mandate for more women lawmakers.
This, along with a corrupt and biased criminal justice system, have shaped an unsafe environment where violence is a daily truth: a rape happens every two minutes due to a 3pc conviction rate.
The timid pro-women stances of female leaders strengthen the grip of misogynistic power structures that prevent parity and divergence. The Punjab chief minister’s pledge to safeguard women from abuse and harassment is questionable: only 924 suspects in a total of 60,217 cases registered across the province in 2024 were convicted; 2,388 were acquitted because of police negligence.
To claim gender parity, justice in these markers is crucial. But the assessment does raise some questions. While India, given its track record of violence against women and hate crimes, is justifiably among the lowest-ranked countries in South Asia at 131, Afghanistan’s absence is puzzling.
 
 

So is the fact that Pakistan is positioned below conflict-ridden Sudan and Yemen, where swathes of women are deprived of employment and healthcare amid internal displacement and sexual abuse.
It raises questions about the methodology adopted to arrive at these conclusions. And strangely, while the Middle East is also criticised for curbs on women, it posted a much higher jump than Pakistan. We should remember that were women’s contributions in the informal sector were documented as data, Pakistan would appear higher than nations where women are particularly dispossessed.

Arranged by the Climate Action Centre, ‘The Indus Resistance Conference’, held for the first time, is a forum aiming to amplify the voices of “frontline defenders” against the exploitation of natural resources.
The first of its kind, the conference brought together women, the working class, lawyers, students and journalists committed to the cause of climate justice. Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022.
“The Indus River is on its deathbed,” said Yasir Darya, founder of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), as he initiated the one-day conference, addressing resource theft and climate injustice in Sindh.
He called for granting the river “personhood status” to ensure its preservation against what he termed “colonial policies, water theft, and capitalist interests”.
Advocate Abira Ashfaq of CAC’s Green Chamber, speaking to Dawn.com, explained what the status of personhood for the Indus River would mean: “If we can have people look at the rights of the river, perhaps that could be a roundabout way to get them to look at other ecological damage that is happening.”
She added, “If a corporation can have legal standing, then why can’t a body of nature?
“It would also be a way to bring in other ecological conversations into the fold — about poverty, about canals on the Indus, about villages, rural rights, the rights of women farmers,” Ashfaq said.
“We talk about how indigenous people have knowledge, which we often take as wisdom — but it is knowledge that is never taken into account.”
 
 

Calling out the state’s “hypocrisy” on water resources in Sindh, former Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) vice president Zubair Abro criticised the contrast between Pakistan’s domestic policies and its international stance.
“Pakistan justifies water allocation on the basis that it is a lower riparian country, but in the same breath, it denies that right to lower riparian areas within the country,” he said while speaking at a panel discussion at the event.
He also noted that the existing water distribution treaties — the Indus Water Treaty and the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord — do not include any provisions for climate or environmental preservation. Abro called for a revision of the agreements.
Challenging what she described as “imperialist extractive policies” enacted by the state on the river, Advocate Romisa Jami said that the Indus River has been made into a commodity.
“It was never meant to be a commodity,” she added.
She urged the audience to view the issue through the lens of “decolonisation”.
While the Indus River is an entire ecosystem for the people of Sindh, “to colonial masters, it offers an opportunity for extraction”, said Jami.
She attributed the loss of sustainable agricultural practices to the “building of irrigation projects by the British Empire”. Jami emphasised that people have come to “inherit our colonial past, which has always been profit-driven and never human-centric”. She recommended an overhaul of the existing system as the only way forward.
 
 

Speakers also raised alarm over recent canal construction and agricultural initiatives introduced under the Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI), which sparked protests across Sindh, particularly in Baberloi, where demonstrations continued for days until the canal project was shelved.
Advocate Kazim Mahesar, activist Amar Haseeb Panhwar and Advocate Riaz Sabzoi — who were involved in the protests — spoke during a panel discussion on resource theft, warning that such initiatives are “just a guise for land theft”.
“We are told to go to court against these decisions, but with the 26th Amendment in place, the doors of justice have been closed for us,” said Panhwar.
Mahesar alleged that “Sindh’s land has been stolen”. He added, “It’s not that we are against development — we only stand against destruction.”
He further argued that such development projects “are only for the elite”, adding that “there is nothing in it for the common man.”
Historian Hafeez Baloch, also speaking on the panel, recalled that Malir — where he was born and raised — was among the first victims of land grabbing in Sindh.
“Malir was an agricultural land, but it was stolen and handed over to capitalists,” he said.
He also referred to the late scholar Gul Hassan Kalmati, who had warned that “what is happening in Malir will eventually happen to the rest of Sindh as well”.</p><small>2025-06-16 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16103409b4738ff.jpg?r=104309' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917412/khawaja-asif-hails-fatf-snub-to-indian-designs' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif hails FATF ‘snub’ to Indian designs</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) decision not to place Pakistan back on its “grey list”, despite a concerted effort by India and Israel, was a major win.
In a post on X on Sunday, Mr Asif said that the FATF had decided against re-listing Pakistan following a meeting of its International Cooperation Review Group a day earlier.
“It is a big victory for Pakistan that despite all the conspiracies of India and Israel, Pakistan has not been included in the grey list,” Mr Asif wrote. He credited the decision to strong support from key allies.
 






“China took a clear stance and supported relief for Pakistan, while Turkey endorsed China’s stance,” Asif said. “Japan also fully supported Pakistan as it is the co-chair of the Asia Pacific Group (APG).”
The FATF, a Paris-based global watchdog that monitors money laundering and terrorism financing, met this week. Its so called ‘grey list’ places countries under increased monitoring until they address identified flaws in their financial systems. Being on the list subjects a country to more intense oversight, which can affect its banking and economic standing with international lenders.
Pakistan was removed from the list in October 2022 after four years of scrutiny.

“In my family, it wasn’t an accepted profession at all, but I’d managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,” she said.
Then last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in the capital Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
News of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post — her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake.

Compared to 58pc of men, only 30pc of women in Pakistan own smartphone — the largest gap in the world, as per 2025’s Mobile Gender Gap Report

In between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: “You reap what you sow” or “it’s deserved, she was tarnishing Islam”.
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits.
 
 

TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
Pakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls “immoral behaviour”, amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.
 
 

After Yousaf’s murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.
“I’m the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,” she said.
‘Fear of being judged’
Only 30 per cent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58pc), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025.
“Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,” said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
In Balochistan, where tribal law governs many rural areas, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour.
In October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over “indecent” TikTok videos.
Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country’s Human Rights Commi­ssion, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.
“This isn’t one crazy man, this is a culture,” said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice.
“Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she’s on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,” she wrote in a post.
In the fifth-most populous country in the world, where 60pc of the population is under the age of 30, the director of digital rights organisation Bolo Bhi, Usama Khilji, says “many women don’t post their profile picture, but a flower, an object, very rarely their face”.
“The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,” he added.
A 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf’s murder and is due to appear in court next week.

One, New Delhi found no takers, except perhaps Israel, for launching military action against Pakistan as a response to the Pahalgam terrorist incident. Two, it elicited international disapproval rather than support for its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Three, re-hyphenation of the two countries that India long opposed, was evidenced most significantly in President Donald Trump’s statements, as also by others. Four, Trump made repeated claims, to India’s ire, that he secured a ceasefire to end the crisis and also offered to mediate on Kashmir. And five, international focus shifted quickly from terrorism to the danger of the crisis morphing into a nuclear flashpoint.
The diplomatic setback faced by India was widely commented upon in the country’s media. A columnist wrote in The Wire about “India’s disastrous isolation in the world”. According to The Wire’s own analysis, “Modi’s domestic rhetoric masked a reality of India’s diminished diplomatic influence and strategic setbacks”. “All indicators,” it wrote, “suggest that the Modi government’s foreign policy failed to convert India’s military gains into sustained diplomatic advantage over Pakistan.”
Brahma Chellaney told India Today that New Delhi lost the narrative, adding, “India’s sluggish response time [in setting the global narrative] had cost it diplomatic capital”. Several papers saw India’s diplomacy failing to convince the world about its case against Pakistan. Others spoke about “diplomatic distancing by neighbours” with India “isolated in the region”. Pakistan’s appointment to key UN counterterrorism committees was also seen as leaving “many red faces in New Delhi”, according to The Hindu and other newspapers.
India’s hubristic assumption that its influence in the world would automatically translate into diplomatic advantage irrespective of how recklessly it behaved by initiating a military conflict turned out to be a strategic miscalculation. A stunning own goal was the false information and fake news it spread and its unfounded claims that seriously dented its international credibility — as indeed its credibility at home.
 
 

The Modi government’s efforts to control the narrative by relying on untruths and flights from reality only made matters worse. Constant denials that the US had helped end the conflict further damaged its credibility. What must have been particularly annoying for New Delhi was to hear Trump’s repeated praise for Pakistan’s leadership and declaring he had good relations with both countries.
That the Modi government had to dispatch seven multiparty delegations to scores of countries to make India’s case was acknowledgment that things had not gone India’s way at the international level. Even Western media coverage, usually sympathetic to India, was sceptical about India’s assertions and critical of its actions. The Washington Post reported on how officially orchestrated “falsehoods filled the airwaves” and “misinformation overtook Indian newsrooms” during the conflict. For their part, several Indian media outlets complained of Western media bias against their country.

Pakistan’s restraint and a series of Indian missteps gave Islamabad a decided diplomatic advantage.

In fact, New Delhi seemed to have set itself unrealistic foreign policy goals and made miscalculations that entailed significant diplomatic costs. Its expectation of unconditional loyalty from its friends and allies, especially the US, was unrealistic if not naïve, and that too from an administration committed to a transactional policy that prioritised America’s interests over all else.
In what was seen as a reprimand to the European Union, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said India “wanted partners not preachers” in response to the EU’s call for restraint during the crisis. Instead of eliciting Europe’s support, he arrogantly advised it to adjust to new geostrategic realities.
He also rebuked the British foreign secretary for equating India and Pakistan. New Delhi’s disingenuous response to Trump taking credit for the ceasefire further undermined its position. India’s effort to block the IMF executive board’s approval of funding for Pakistan was a failure foretold and only made New Delhi look foolish.
By its own acts of commission and omission, the Modi government found itself on the diplomatic backfoot. It misassessed the reality that there is no international appetite for a military confrontation between two nuclear neighbours that could lead to uncontrolled escalation.

Borrowing from the Israeli playbook and applying it to South Asia would not work in a nuclearised environment

And also, borrowing from the Israeli playbook and applying it to South Asia would not work in a nuclearised environment. The diplomatic outreach undertaken by its delegations fared no better. They failed to shift the needle and their clumsy approach, riddled with contradictions, did little to change international perceptions. For that reason, their conduct attracted criticism and even ridicule at home.
 
 

A combination of Pakistan’s responsible exercise of restraint and a series of Indian missteps — and the contrast between the two — handed Islamabad a decided diplomatic advantage.
This represented quite a role reversal, as often in the past India had dominated the narrative on the international stage, reinforced, of course, by its strategic and economic importance, with Pakistan placed on the defensive. Not so this time. India’s military overreach and strategic miscalculations left it struggling to achieve its foreign policy aims. Pakistan’s measured but effective military riposte to Indian aggression and its nimble diplomatic moves enabled the country to secure an advantage over India.
That, however, is no reason to be complacent or assume Islamabad can maintain the diplomatic upper hand. Translating a transient advantage into a longer-term gain will require careful planning and an imaginative strategy. Its starting point — and I have argued this before — must be a wide-ranging review of foreign policy.
If new diplomatic opportunities have arisen from the crisis with India, these can only be seized by a well-thought-out strategy crafted after a comprehensive evaluation of the international landscape. Such a review is in any case long overdue given changing global power dynamics and geopolitical shifts.
Pakistan needs to capitalise on this moment of opportunity by resetting its foreign policy goals and evolving a strategy to match a changed international scenario — where India will pose imposing challenges on multiple fronts, but also one in which Pakistan-China strategic relations have been further fortified. It should strive to do that before the diplomatic gains reaped from its adversary’s mistakes begin to fade.

His funeral was held at a local mosque, which was attended by his colleagues and relatives, after which he was laid to rest at the Mohammad Shah graveyard. The Soyem will be held at his residence in Saima Arabian Villas today (Monday).
Mr Jalal is survived by his widow and five children.
A key member of Dawn’s newsroom since 1992, Mr Jalal began his journalistic career from the daily Sindh Guardian in his native Hyderabad, his long-time colleague Mohammad Hussain Khan recalled. He moved to Karachi in the mid-1990s, where he joined Dawn as a sub-editor.
He then rose among the ranks to become a shift incharge, and was eventually designated as the deputy news editor in 2022.
Mr Jalal was extremely well-respected among media circles for his wealth of experience. His affable nature and professional conduct endeared him to his colleagues.
As one of the most senior members of the Dawn newsroom, Mr Jalal also mentored many budding journalists. He served as a bridge, helping new generation of editors navigate the ever-changing media landscape while relaying lessons learned from past editors.

Under the National Fina­nce Commis­sion (NFC) Awa­rd, Balochistan is set to receive Rs743 billion from federal revenues, distributed mainly through the divisible pool taxes and dir­ect transfers from natural resources, including gas.
Officials expect the pro­v­ince to receive an additional Rs70bn in federal funds.
Meanwhile, Balochistan’s own revenue, generated through provincial taxes and non-tax sou­rces, is estimated to surpass Rs150bn.
Non-development expe­n­d­iture for the upcoming year is projected to exceed Rs700bn, while more than Rs240bn may be earmarked from the province’s own resources for development spending. Substantial funds are likely to be allocated to key sectors, including education, law and order, health, infrastructure, and agriculture.
More than Rs160bn is expected to go to the education sector, over Rs100bn to law and order, and around Rs80bn to health services.
Salaries of government employees in Balochistan are also likely to be increased in line with federal government’s announcement. Provincial employees have been protesting in recent weeks to demand pay raise and other benefits.

While the government may tout improved economic stewardship, for ordinary Pakistanis, life remains extremely difficult. Besides the challenge of making ends meet, basic public services — such as dependable water supply, affordable gas and electricity, and decent job opportunities — are either inadequate or out of reach.
The situation has been harsh, and the budget presented last week offers little hope for meaningful relief. If anything, it has further diminished the modest expectations people may have had, particularly for families caught between the two social extremes; the ones neither poor enough to qualify for support nor affluent enough to absorb the rising living cost.
Pakistan’s struggling salaried middle-income group — estimated to have lost half its strength over the last five years as rising living costs and falling household real incomes pushed many into poverty — received no assurance from Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb of a more supportive environment in the year ahead. The 2025-26 budget proposals, if passed, suggest that this segment will continue to bear the burden of the government’s policy failures and the inefficiencies of both public and private utility providers.
 
 

Even those who reject the idea of a ‘manufactured government’ find themselves questioning the democratic credentials of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, based solely on its taxation policies. It is hard to imagine a truly elected government being so indifferent or unwise as to impose direct taxes on families subsisting below the poverty line.
The proposed budget contains multiple instances where the government has chosen measures that disproportionately penalise the voiceless and vulnerable, those already living in subhuman conditions, to accommodate the more fortunate.
 


While spatial constraints do not permit listing every such decision, the following examples illustrate the mindset and priorities of the government in relation to the general public: it was reported that the income tax rate for individuals earning between Rs50,001 and Rs100,000 per month was revised upward from one per cent, as initially announced by Mr Aurangzeb in his budget speech, to 2.5pc. This regressive adjustment was reportedly made to offset the impact of last-minute increases in the salaries and pensions of civil servants. In the last budget the applied rate was 5pc.
Further highlighting this skewed approach, the finance minister, during the post-budget press conference, cited the decision to keep the minimum wage unchanged at Rs37,000 as part of the government’s strategy to support businesses to remain competitive, effectively sidelining the working poor in favour of corporate cost control. I challenge any economic wizard, within or outside the government, to draft a realistic family budget with this amount, keeping in mind that the minimum wage must sustain a typical family of seven members.
 


In the absence of an official definition of ‘the middle class’ in Pakistan, an attempt was made to identify it based on expected living standards associated with this segment. By reasonable estimates, individuals supporting families on a monthly income of approximately Rs150,000 to Rs350,000 fall within the middle-income-group category. This group lies in the top three of five income brackets, where the proposed income tax relief is minimal, barely 4pc to none, depending on each individual’s nominal annual income.
The majority within the projected middle-income bracket — approximately 70pc — earn closer to Rs150,000 per month. For families near this lower threshold, the tax burden has seen modest relief, with the proposed rate reduced to 11pc from the previously 15pc. However, for those earning above Rs222,000 per month, the applicable tax rate ranges from 15pc to 30pc, offering little or no relief for a significant portion of the middle-income group.
Overall, in a year when official inflation is projected to exceed 7pc, a tax relief of 4pc or less will leave households in this income category worse off starting July, even before factoring in other rising costs and growing needs based on tax liability alone.
It would not be an exaggeration to conclude that families in this category will not only be unfairly burdened for non-compliant taxpayers and those who managed to remain outside the tax net, such as traders, realtors and landed aristocracy, but also pay for the follies of policymakers and corruption leading to slippages in revenue collection in the Federal Board of Revenue and its departments.
 


Given the cost of living, the tax exemption limit should have been doubled. A basic home-cooked meal for a family of seven costs at least Rs500 per day, amounting to Rs42,000 monthly, including essentials like tea, milk, and sugar. Taxation should begin at no lower than a monthly income of Rs150,000.
It is worth noting that using the $2.1 per person per day international poverty threshold, a seven-member Pakistani household would require a monthly income of around Rs150,000 to barely rise above the poverty line based on current exchange rates and basic arithmetic.
To understand the impact of the proposed budgetary measures on middle-class households, the spending pattern of a typical family was analysed. Key expenditure heads and their relative weight in a standard family budget were identified, and overall impact was assessed. The findings are summarised in the table.

According to an official statement, the clarification by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial was given during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, which discussed the federal budget presented last week.
The committee approved the proposal to impose sales tax on e-commerce items.
The FBR chairman said online businesses already collect tax from consumers but don’t deposit it with the FBR.
 
 

He further elaborated that courier services will now be designated as collection agents, since they possess the seller’s invoice.
However, sales tax will not apply to services provided locally.
The government, in an attempt to tax digital businesses, has proposed mandatory registration of all digital vendors, including foreign e-commerce companies, if they sell goods to Pakistani customers.
The committee reviewed penalties for unregistered entities, with members expressing concerns about the impact on small and one-time online sellers.
The FBR chairman assured the members that housewives and those involved in one-time transactions will be protected and will not be required to register.
The meeting also discussed the powers granted to tax officials to arrest suspected tax evaders and the harsh penalties proposed for tax fraud.
In the Finance Bill, the government proposed 10 years imprisonment and fines for fraud exceeding Rs10 million.
The members also debated the scope of tax officers’ power under Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
The meeting was told that earlier, assistant commissioners were empowered to arrest suspected tax evaders.
Now, it has been revised to require prior inquiry and the commissioner’s approval for arrest.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani said the amendment was “a step towards protecting procedural integrity and reducing arbitrary arrests”.
However, committee members remained sceptical over the potential misuse of these powers.
In response to the objections, the FBR chairman assured the committee that a revised draft of the relevant provisions would be submitted today. The committee will continue the deliberation on the Finance Bill 2025-26 today (Monday), the press release said.

The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14, despite its timing.
Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade, but some sources speculated that he spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The Pakistani embassy in Washington, however, refused to confirm or deny this claim.
The sources said the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.

PTI supporters protest outside embassy ahead of army chief’s arrival

Meanwhile, several PTI supporters staged a protest outside the Pakistan embassy on Saturday afternoon, calling for the restoration of what they described as “unfettered democracy” in Pakistan.
The demonstration came ahead of the COAS’s arrival. “We believe the army chief is in Washi­ngton, and that’s why we’re here,” said one of the protest organisers, linking the demonstration to the COAS’ presence in the US.
 






The Pakistani embassy declined to confirm or deny the visit at the time of the protest.
The army chief’s trip comes at a particularly delicate time, following Israeli airstrikes in Iran.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, said the visit is complicated by the regional tensions.
“Pakistan wants to cultivate US support but has condemned the Israeli strikes and is working to strengthen ties with Tehran,” Mr Kugelman noted. “For Gen Munir to be in the capital of Israel’s closest ally and Iran’s primary adversary at such a tense moment could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.”
 
 

He added that the unfolding Middle East crisis may also limit how fully US officials can engage with the visiting Pakistani delegation.
Mr Kugelman said counterterrorism cooperation will likely dominate the agenda, and Field Marshal Munir may try to build on recent improvements in bilateral ties following the India-Pakistan ceasefire. However, broader efforts to reframe the security partnership would remain a “hard sell”, he warned.
Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, underscored the strategic imbalance in US regional priorities.
“Washington sees Pakistan in the China camp but as a useful counterterrorism base,” Mr Nawaz said.
“It sees greater trade and markets for its technology and defence materials in India. This makes an unequal situation.”

• Israeli soldier killed in south Gaza
• Massive protest in The Hague calls for ‘end to genocide’
CAIRO: Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 41 Palestinians across Gaza on Sunday, local health authorities said, at least five of them near two aid sites operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
An Israeli soldier was also killed in Gaza, the army confirmed on Sunday.
Medics at Al-Awda Hospital in the central Gaza Strip said at least three people were killed and dozens wounded by Israeli fire as they tried to approach a GHF site near the Netzarim corridor.
Two others were killed en route to another aid site in Rafah in the south.
An airstrike killed seven other people in Beit Lahiya town north of the enclave, medics said.
In Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, medics said an Israeli airstrike killed at least 11 people in a house. The rest were killed in separate airstrikes in the southern Gaza Strip, they added.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near-daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.
The UN rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.
The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 300 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,600 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.
“These are not humanitarian aid, these are traps for the poor and the hungry under the watch of occupation planes,” said Munir Al-Bursh, Director-General of the health ministry.
Israeli soldier killed
The Israeli soldier killed in Gaza a day earlier was identified as Noam Shemesh, 21, from Jerusalem.
In a statement, the military said he “… fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip”.
About 430 soldiers have been killed since Israel’s ground operation in Gaza began on October 27, 2023.
Protests in Europe
Tens of thousands of people dressed in red marched through the streets of The Hague on Sunday to demand more action from the Dutch government against what they termed a “genocide” in Gaza.
The protest followed similar pro-Palestine demonstrations across major European cities, including Brussels, Paris, Zurich and Madrid, throughout the week.
Rights groups such as Amnesty International and Oxfam organised the demonstration through the city to the International Court of Justice, creating a so-called “red line”.
With many waving Palestinian flags and some chanting “Stop the Genocide”, the demonstrators turned a central park in the city into a sea of red on a sunny afternoon.
One of the organising groups, Oxfam Novib, estimated 150,000 people participated in the march. Organisers urged the Dutch government — which collapsed on June 3 after a far-right party pulled out of a fragile coalition — to do more to rein in Israel for its military offensive on the Palestinian territory.
Demonstrators on Sunday called for the caretaker government to speak out against what they said were ongoing violations of international law by Israel.
“More than 150,000 people here dressed in red —and a clear majority of the Dutch population — just want concrete sanctions to stop the genocide in Gaza,” said Michiel Servaes, director of Oxfam Novib.
“We demand action now from our government.”
Dodo Van Der Sluis, a 67-year-old pensioner, told AFP: “It has to stop.
Enough is enough. I can’t take it anymore.“ “I’m here because I think it’s maybe the only thing you can do now as a Dutch citizen, but it’s something you have to do,” she added.
In response to the protests, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the goal is to end the war in Gaza as soon as possible.
“To all those people in The Hague I say: we see you and we hear you.” “In the end, our goal is the same: to end the suffering in Gaza as soon as possible,” he wrote in a post on X.

• Crisis deepens in Balochistan as supply from Iran disrupted
• ME conflict worries global markets
QUETTA/KARACHI: The federal government has jacked up the prices of both petrol and diesel, with their rates climbing by Rs4.80 and Rs7.95 per litre, respectively.
According to a Finance Division notification issued on late Sunday night, the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.
High-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.
Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.
Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by about Re1 and Rs5 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.
Fuel crisis deepens in Balochistan
Meanwhile, the fuel crisis in Balochistan has taken a serious turn amid the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, as the supply of Iranian oil through the border has been badly affected, leading to the closure of a large number of petrol pumps.
The border districts of Balochistan with Iran, including Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk, and Mashkail are worst-affected, as they were not only facing suspension of Iranian oil supply, but also a food shortage, as most eatable supplies also come from Iran.
Around 60 to 70 per cent petrol pumps have been closed due to suspension of supply of Iranian smuggled oil through Makran, Rakhshan and Chagai areas. The petrol pumps selling smuggled Iranian petrol and diesel were already closed by the district administration last week, which also added to citizens’ woes in Quetta and other districts.
 
 

Those involved in the Iranian petrol business had increased prices, selling petrol for Rs280 to 300 per litre in the black market, while the government had fixed the local petrol price at Rs254 per litre.
The petrol supply from Karachi was also affected due to the road blockade between Quetta and the port city at different points.
‘No fuel shortage’
However, the Balochistan government claimed that there was no fuel shortage in the province, as most petrol pumps were open in the provincial capital.
In a statement, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind refuted the impression that the province was facing a fuel shortage.
He said that petrol stations selling Iranian oil are safety hazards, citing 28 fuel-related accidents across Quetta in the past month, including incidents on Airport Road and in Hazar Ganji area.
“These so-called shortages are being exaggerated by those who want to lift the ban on smuggled Iranian fuel,” Rind said, adding that strict action is being taken to ensure the supply of legal petrol through registered pumps. Petrol stations found involved in hoarding or refusing service will face immediate legal consequences, he warned.
Global oil price volatility
The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has raised significant concerns in global markets, particularly in the energy sector, due to both countries’ strategic positions in the Middle East, a region critical to the global oil supply chain.
Investors were on edge ahead of markets reopening late on Sunday, gripped by anxiety over the escalating threat of a sweeping conflict in the Middle East and nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
Oil prices rose by 7pc on Friday, as Israel and Iran traded strikes, and investors will be watching closely to see how prices react when markets open today (Monday).
Israel’s strikes on Iran’s oil and gas industry lifted oil prices and prompted a rush into gold and the dollar, which resumed its role as a safe-haven asset for the first time in months.
Oil prices at close to six-month highs could pose a risk to the inflation outlook, as central banks around the world grapple with the impact on prices from Trump’s trade tariffs and the effect on economic growth.
Energy experts said if hostilities remain limited to tit-for-tat strikes without affecting shipping lanes or oil fields then oil prices may see short-term volatility, but stabilise quickly later.
In other case, if the conflict escalates, impacting the Strait of Hormuz or drags in other countries, the oil prices could surge above $100 per barrel, they feared.

Earlier, on Feb 11, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had formally written to the government and the opposition, seeking nominations for the parliamentary panel.
“The parliamentary committee will be formed once the nominations are received,” he had said during a sitting of the National Assembly.
A spokesperson for the National Assembly said on Sunday that the speaker has so far not received any formal letter from the prime minister about the formation of the parliamentary committee for the appointment of the CEC and two members of the ECP.
“The process will commence only once the letter is officially received”, the spokesman added.
He further said that the premier had already initiated the required consultation with the Leader of the Opposition on May 16, 2025, in accordance with Clause 2A of Article 213 of the Constitution.
“This consultation is aimed at finalising three names each for the posts of Chief Election Commissi­oner and members of the Election Commission from Sindh and Balochistan.”
The spokesperson said that as soon as the consultation process is completed, the speaker will invite nominations from the respective parliamentary leaders in Parliament for the constitution of the said parliamentary committee, as per Clause 2B of Article 213 of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the National Assembly Secretariat respo­nded to a letter written by Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, seeking the formation of a parliamentary panel on the appointment of a new CEC and two ECP members.
The letter, seen by Dawn, draws the attention of the opposition leader to clauses 2A and 2B of Article 213 read with Clause 2B of Article 218 of the Constitution.
Clause 2A of Article 213 reads, “The Prime Minister shall in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, forward three names for appointment of the Commissioner to a Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person”.
Clause 2B reads, “The Parliame­ntary Committee to be constituted by the Speaker shall comprise fifty percent members from the Treasury Benches and fifty percent from the Opposition Parties, based on their strength in Majlis-e-Shoora (Parlia­ment), to be nominated by the respective Parliamentary Leaders.”
However, none of the two clauses appears to restrict formation of a parliamentary committee before the completion of the consultation process.
On June 4, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had written a letter to Mr Khan inviting him for consultation on appointment of CEC and two members of the Commission without specifying any date.
The five-year term of the chief election commissioner and two ECP members had expired on January 26 but under a controversial amendment they will continue to hold their offices till the appointment of their successors.

The ministry provided written details to the National Assembly in response to a question from lawmaker Shazia Marri, who had asked for the year-wise number of repatriated Pakistanis, particularly those held for minor or non-criminal offences. 
According to the ministry, the repatriated citizens had been imprisoned in 22 countries for offences including drug-related crimes, immigration violations, illegal entry and other mixed cases. 
“Our diplomatic missions provide extensive support services that encompass legal assistance, medical care, and financial aid to ensure that no Pakistani citizen faces these challenges alone,” the ministry said.  

Most prisoners brought back from from Malaysia, Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia

“Our missions’ consular services have successfully facilitated the repatriation of these people.”  
The report covered repatriations from 2022 to 2025. 
Of the 18,533 repatriated individuals, 5,908 were returned from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia); 5,435 from Muscat (Oman); 3,570 from Baghdad (Iraq); 1,563 from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia); and 935 from Tripoli (Libya). 
Other repatriations included 530 from Athens (Greece); 245 from Astana (Kazakhstan); 110 from New York (United States); 56 from Colombo (Sri Lanka); 37 from Algiers (Algeria); 35 from Male (Maldives); 20 each from Rome (Italy) and Manila (Philippines); 16 from Bangkok (Thailand); 15 from Abuja (Nigeria); 10 from Chengdu (China); seven from Mashhad (Iran); and six each from Manchester (United Kingdom) and Beijing (China).  
Smaller numbers were also repatriated from cities including two from Kathmandu (Nepal), five from Beirut (Lebanon) and two Singapore. 
Additionally, the ministry reported that 8,559 prisoners were released from Saudi Arabia over five years, describing it as the single largest success. 
48 Pakistani prisoners were repatriated from Maldives during 2018-2024, while 69 prisoners were released from Qatar through Emiri Pardons — 23 in December 2023 and 46 during Ramadan 2024.  
In Iran, 46 cases were resolved, with 14 repatriated in 2020 and 32 granted amnesty and negotiations are ongoing for 60 additional cases. The ministry also noted that the Qatar distributed 50 riyals per prisoner to 200 individuals. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its commitment to protecting and assisting Pakistani nationals abroad, particularly those in vulnerable situations within foreign judicial systems.

The development comes as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran earlier today, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq.
Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
According to statements issued by deputy commissioners (DC) across the province today, the Balochistan government has closed all Iranian borders adjacent to the Gwadar district and imposed a ban on travel corridors due to the deteriorating situation in the region.
A statement issued by the Gwadar DC’s office said, “In light of instructions from the Balochistan government, the Gwadar district administration has closed the corridor at the Gabd-Kalato 250 border until further notice.
“The public is requested to cooperate and contact the district administration for any information or guidance,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the Panjgur district administration also closed all crossing points connected to Iran for an indefinite period, stating that this decision was taken as a precautionary measure due to the current regional security situation.
The announcement said that not only movement by foot through these routes been halted, but the delivery of fuel has also been completely banned.
The Panjgur DC maintained that these measures were taken due to “the possible uncertain situation in Iran and the security threats arising from international tensions”.
“The district administration has appealed to the public to fully cooperate with … in the current situation and avoid unnecessary movement in order to avoid any unexpected situation,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, in a post on X this afternoon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government was taking necessary measures for the welfare and safety of Pakistani nationals.
 






He noted that 450 Pakistani zaireen (pilgrims) had been evacuated from Iran yesterday. Arrangements have been made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.
“Our Embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani zaireen who are stranded due to the closure of airspace,” Dar said on X. “Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation.”
He noted that the Crisis Management Unit at the Foreign Office is operational 247 and can be contacted at:
+92 51-9207887  and cmu1@mofa.gov.pk
“Our embassies in the region are closely coordinating all necessary efforts to support Pakistani nationals and zaireen,” Dar added.
Following Israel’s initial strikes, PM Shehbaz on Friday directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani pilgrims currently in Iran.
The Foreign Office also advised all pilgrims from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran Mudasir Tipu is currently in his home country for official meetings, the FO said.
“The embassy under the instructions of the foreign minister along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working to extend all possible facilitation to Pakistanis in Iran,” it added.
Dar, Turkish FM express concern
Dar received a telephone call on Sunday from Foreign Minister of Turkiye Hakan Fidan as both leaders expressed “deep concern and anguish over the deteriorating regional situation due to Israel’s unjustified attacks on Iran”.
He also confirmed his participation in the forthcoming meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM), and the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum’s (ICYF) ceremony both scheduled to be held next week in Istanbul.
PM Shehbaz had earlier during a telephonic call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Pakistan’s presence in the events.

Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, said Saqib, who is also the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer.
The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to the press release, Saylor had a meeting with Saqib and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, where the discussion revolved around how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for sovereign reserves, monetary
resilience and driving long-term digital economic transformation.
Calling Saylor “one of the most influential voices in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption”, the statement outlined that his enterprise software company Strategy holds the largest corporate reserve of Bitcoin.
“His (Saylor’s) advocacy echoes the [US President Donald] Trump-era vision of economic sovereignty, decentralisation of financial power and investment in long-term national strength through hard digital assets,” the statement read.
“Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
Saqib was quoted as saying that Saylor’s work in the crypto field transformed Bitcoin into a “sovereign-grade asset”.
“In five years, Mr Saylor transformed a mid-sized software firm into a $100 billion company, purely through strategic vision, bold conviction and disciplined execution,” Saqib said. “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same? We have the talent, the story, and the energy.”
According to the statement, Saylor praised Pakistan’s efforts to take a “forward-looking, innovation-friendly stance in the global digital economy” and welcomed the opportunity to support ongoing developments and advise.
“Pakistan has many brilliant people. It also has commitment and clarity needed by businesses globally,” Saylor was quoted as saying.
“Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he added. “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.”
The statement hailed the dialogue as “another milestone in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest and position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market”.
Earlier this month, the PCC agreed to form a technical committee to draft a framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance announced in a statement.
According to the ministry’s press release, the council’s launch marks a “significant step in the country’s efforts to regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into its financial landscape”.
“The council is set to play a pivotal role in formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.</p><small>2025-06-15 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609330-war-only-option-if-india-blocks-pakistans-water-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>War only option if India blocks Pakistan's water, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>
