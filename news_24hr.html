<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261357141cec107.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937350/indian-lenders-told-to-step-up-checks-on-funds-flowing-indirectly-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indian lenders told to step up checks on funds flowing indirectly from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the country’s lenders to increase scrutiny over funds flowing indirectly from Pakistan, according to a letter seen by Reuters that cited a “high risk” of such money being used to buy arms.
Direct flows of funds from Pakistan to India are largely prohibited, with every transaction requiring the central bank’s approval.
The directive, dated August 6, follows investigations by Indian agencies after the two neighbouring countries engaged in a fierce military conflict in May, triggered by India blaming Pakistan, without evidence, for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
The RBI named Pakistan a “high risk” jurisdiction from an arms financing perspective and cited Indian investigations into arms financing, but did not go into detail about their findings.
According to a government source with direct knowledge of the matter, Indian investigative authorities found that some Pakistani nationals had sent funds to India via other countries.
India’s banking channels are at a “high risk of being used for arms funding by Pakistan”, alleged the source, who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.
The central bank has general guidelines in place for banks to prevent money laundering and the financing of arms and terrorism, but a directive drawing attention to Pakistan is rare.
The Reserve Bank of India did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
Zafar Masud, president of the Pakistan Banks Association, said in a statement that Pakistan’s “anti-money laundering laws and combating the financing of terrorism is very strict and robust.”
The RBI letter to banks and non-bank lenders also separately cited instances where Pakistan has been accused of violating global sanctions and rules.
It noted that a June 2025 report by the global anti-money laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force had accused a Pakistan state-owned entity, the National Development Complex, of “evading sanctions by importing items for missile development without declaring them.”
Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The letter also listed North Korea as a “high risk” jurisdiction, citing sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on the country in the past.</p><small>2025-08-26 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2613413557cd01e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937340/nearly-150000-relocated-across-punjab-ahead-of-flood-warnings-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Nearly 150,000 relocated across Punjab ahead of flood warnings: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>Nearly 150,000 people have been evacuated so far from flood-prone areas across Punjab as the province braces for heavy rains and floods, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Tuesday.
A devastating monsoon season marked by record rainfall, glacier melt, and widespread flooding has exposed Pakistan’s extreme vulnerability to climate change. The “high flood” warnings this week have put Punjab on high alert and prompted mass evacuations in various places.
“Nearly 150,000 people have so far been relocated to safer areas from flood-prone regions,” state-run APP reported, adding that it followed early warnings and alerts issued by NDMA regarding rising water levels and potential flooding.
The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) initiated “large-scale evacuation operations” in vulnerable places following the swelling of the Sutlej River, the report said.
“Emergency response teams were deployed, and all concerned departments were placed on high alert to safeguard public life and property,” it added.
The data provided by the NDMA showed evacuations included 89,868 residents from Bahawalnagar, 14,140 from Kasur, 2,063 from Okara, 873 from Pakpattan, 361 from Bahawalpur, and 165 from Vehari, according to the APP.
It further said that around 40,000 people had moved to safer locations soon after the initial alerts.
The NDMA directed all institutions and emergency services to remain vigilant, urging citizens to avoid flood-prone areas, unnecessary travel, and follow safety instructions disseminated through alerts, it added.
Separately, a warning of “extremely high flood levels” was issued for the Sutlej River, state media PTV reported, adding that the water level in the river reached 195,000 cusecs.
A day earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz issued orders to evacuate the people living in areas around rivers and low-lying regions, while the Ministry of Climate Change predicted heavy rains in Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Lahore divisions “with a high risk of both riverine and urban flooding”.
 
 

An alert by Punjab PDMA on Monday reported “high flood level” in the Sutlej River at 10am, urging district administrations across Punjab to maintain a “high level of preparedness and mitigation of the disaster”.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) also issued a flood warning for the Chenab River and Ravi River yesterday, stating that the intensity of rainfall over the eastern rivers was “likely to increase significantly”.
In light of a flood alert by India, more than 24,000 people had been relocated from the low-lying areas of the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers since Saturday, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.</p><small>2025-08-26 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26135224193ba04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937349/pakistan-buys-initial-30000-tonnes-sugar-in-tender-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan buys initial 30,000 tonnes sugar in tender, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has purchased an initial 30,000 tonnes of white sugar in an international tender seeking around 200,000 tonnes, European traders said on Tuesday.
On July 8, the government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
The validity of other price offers submitted in the tender, which closed last week, has been extended until tomorrow, so more purchases are seen as possible, traders said.
The initial 30,000-tonne purchase was believed to have been made from Al Khaleej Sugar for medium-grade sugar at an estimated $582.50 a ton, cost and freight (c&f) included, they said.
 
 

Reports reflect assessments from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later. The tender sought sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.
The TCP is believed to have purchased about 55,000 tonnes of white sugar in a previous international tender seeking up to 100,000 tonnes. The recent purchase will bring the total amount of sugar bought to 85,000 tonnes.
The government has vowed strict monitoring of sugar stocks and also placed some unidentified mill owners on the Exit Control List in a bid to stabilise rates.
A cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p><small>2025-08-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26131946a897ad7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937347/powerful-optics-chinas-xi-to-welcome-putin-modi-in-grand-show-of-solidarity' target='_blank'><strong>‘Powerful optics’: China’s Xi to welcome Putin, Modi in grand show of solidarity</strong></a><br><p>President Xi Jinping will gather more than 20 world leaders at a regional security forum in China next week in a powerful show of Global South solidarity in the age of Donald Trump while also helping sanctions-hit Russia pull off another diplomatic coup.
Aside from Russian President Vladimir Putin, leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, to be held in the northern port city of Tianjin from August 31 to September 1.
The summit will feature Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020.
Modi last shared the same stage with Xi and Putin at last year’s BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, even as Western leaders turned their backs on the Russian leader amid the war in Ukraine.
Russian embassy officials in New Delhi last week said Moscow hopes trilateral talks with China and India will take place soon.
“Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
“Just look at how much BRICS has rattled (US President) Donald Trump, which is precisely what these groups are designed to do.”
This year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO was founded in 2001, a Chinese foreign ministry official said last week, calling the bloc an “important force in building a new type of international relations”.
The security-focused bloc, which began as a group of six Eurasian nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer countries in recent years. Its remit has also enlarged from security and counter-terrorism to economic and military cooperation.
‘Fuzzy’ implementation
Analysts say expansion is high on the agenda for many countries attending, but agree the bloc has not delivered substantial cooperation outcomes over the years and that China values the optics of Global South solidarity against the United States at a time of erratic policymaking and geopolitical flux.
“What is the precise vision that the SCO represents, and its practical implementation are rather fuzzy. It is a platform that has increasing convening power, which helps in narrative projection,” said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Research Programme at the Takshashila Institution thinktank in Bangalore.
“But the SCO’s effectiveness in addressing substantial security issues remains very limited.”
Frictions remain between core members India and Pakistan. The June SCO defence ministers’ meeting was unable to adopt a joint statement after India raised objections, saying it omitted reference to the deadly April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in Indian-occupied Kashmir, which led to the worst fighting in decades between India and Pakistan.
New Delhi also refused to join the SCO’s condemnation of Israeli attacks on Iran, a member state, earlier in June.
But the recent détente between India and China after five years of heightened border frictions, as well as renewed tariff pressure on New Delhi from the Trump administration, are driving expectations for a positive meeting between Xi and Modi on the sidelines of the summit.
“It’s likely (New Delhi) will swallow their pride and put this year’s SCO problems behind them in a bid to maintain momentum in the détente with China, which is a key Modi priority right now,” said Olander.
Analysts expect both sides to announce further incremental border measures such as troop withdrawals, the easing of trade and visa restrictions, cooperation in new fields including climate, and broader government and people-to-people engagement.
Despite the lack of substantive policy announcements expected at the summit, experts warn that the bloc’s appeal to Global South countries should not be underestimated.
“This summit is about optics, really powerful optics,” added Olander.
Modi is expected to depart from China after the summit, while Putin will stay on for a World War Two military parade in Beijing later in the week for an unusually long spell outside of Russia.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620453-cleric-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-arrested-under-3-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza arrested under 3-MPO</strong></a><br><p>

Human smuggling from Pakistan to Iran has been a persistent issue, with many migrants attempting to cross through perilous land and sea routes in search of better economic opportunities or to reach onward destinations in the Middle East and Europe, according to a report by the National Initiative against Organised Crime.  Gwadar and other parts of Balochistan are frequently used as key transit points, where traffickers exploit vulnerable citizens by charging hefty sums for the dangerous journeys.
Per the FIA’s statement, “major operations” were carried out by the agency’s Composite Circle Gwadar, through which the suspects were arrested from different areas of the district.
“The arrested suspects are involved in sending citizens from Pakistan to Iran through illegal sea routes,” it said. “The suspect extorted Rs10,000 each from the victims.”
The suspects were arrested after being identified by the victims, the statement further said, adding that an investigation into the matter had been initiated.
Last week, FIA Balochistan arrested five traffickers in Taftan and Loralai for allegedly facilitating illegal travel abroad using fake documents and charging millions of rupees from the victims.
The group was sending people to Iran and Turkiye through illegal routes and fake documents, according to the FIA spokesperson.
“Three of the suspects were listed as most wanted by Pakistani embassies in Iran and Turkiye,” the spokesperson said, adding that they had already sent large numbers of people abroad illegally.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261111463e8fbfe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937325/two-more-polio-cases-confirmed-in-southern-kp-taking-2025-nationwide-tally-to-23' target='_blank'><strong>Two more polio cases confirmed in southern KP, taking 2025 nationwide tally to 23</strong></a><br><p>Two more poliovirus cases were confirmed in the southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bringing Pakistan’s total count this year to 23, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Tuesday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest cases include a 16-month-old girl from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district and a 24-month-old girl from Union Council Miran Shah-3 in North Waziristan district.
“With these detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 23, including 15 cases from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement noted.
“Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, alongside timely completion of all routine immunisations. Despite significant progress, the continued detection of polio cases, particularly in Southern KP, remains a serious concern,” as per the statement.
The statement noted that children in hard-to-access areas and those with low vaccine acceptance continue to be at risk, adding that the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) are taking all possible measures to ensure the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns.
It added that the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication has developed a vaccination campaign scheduled for the upcoming low transmission season. The first campaign of the season will be conducted from September 1 to 7, while in southern KP, the campaign will commence on September 15, targeting more than 28 million children under the age of five.
“The aim is to ensure that every child in these districts is vaccinated against polio as part of ongoing efforts to rapidly strengthen immunity and address existing protection gaps,” the statement said, urging parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive the polio vaccine during the campaign as well as the upcoming ones.
“Polio eradication is a shared responsibility. While frontline health workers continue to deliver critical vaccines to children, parents and caregivers play an important role by ensuring their children receive all recommended doses of the polio vaccine and complete their routine immunisations,” according to the statement.
“Communities can protect their children by actively supporting vaccination efforts, countering misinformation, and encouraging others to vaccinate.”
Last week, two new poliovirus cases were reported involving a six-year-old girl from KP’s Kohistan district and a 21-month-old girl from Sindh’s Badin.
Earlier this month, poliovirus was found in 36 per cent of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261159341c8649c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937333/jhelum-police-detain-cleric-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-under-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Jhelum police detain cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza under MPO</strong></a><br><p>Jhelum police said early on Tuesday that they have detained cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza for 30 days under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance for alleged controversial remarks.
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meesam Abbas and District Police Officer (DPO) Ahmed Mohiyuddin confirmed Mirza’s arrest under MPO to Dawn.com.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
A religious group had yesterday filed an application, seen by Dawn.com, requesting legal action against Mirza for alleged controversial remarks made during an interview that “went viral on social media”.
Mirza was also among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram last year to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-08-26 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261210129f79128.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937337/ngumoha-in-dream-premier-league-debut-with-late-winner-for-liverpool-at-newcastle' target='_blank'><strong>Ngumoha in dream Premier League debut with late winner for Liverpool at Newcastle</strong></a><br><p>The absent Alexander Isak dominated the build-up to Newcastle United’s clash at home to Liverpool but the Swede was temporarily forgotten in a rip-roaring contest that ended 3-2 to the reigning champions thanks to a stoppage-time winner by teenaged Premier League debutant Rio Ngumoha.
Isak’s desire to leave Newcastle, with Liverpool his destination of choice, guaranteed a boisterous St James’ Park atmosphere and it seemed Arne Slot’s visitors had buckled as they threw away a flattering 2-0 lead against a side reduced to 10 men by Anthony Gordon’s red card in first-half stoppage time.
But 16-year-old Ngumoha broke Newcastle’s hearts shortly after coming off the bench, thrashing in the winner with a first-time right-foot shot in the 10th minute of stoppage time to become Liverpool’s youngest ever scorer and the fourth youngest in Premier League history.

It was a sickening blow for Newcastle who were again without outcast striker Isak, but who began the game in superb fashion.
Even when the red mist and fate had dealt them multiple blows they still showed great resilience to fight back but it all counted for nothing in the end.
“We know there was a lot of oil on the fire this week to get Newcastle fired up,” Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk said.
“I enjoy these type of atmospheres, so I was really looking forward to it but we could’ve made it easier. We gave them the boost and the feeling and the drive with the fans behind them but we managed to get the three points and move on.”
Liverpool had been forced to soak up Newcastle pressure for half an hour and had made little headway but took the lead completely against the run of play when Ryan Gravenberch cut in from the left and dispatched a low shot just inside Nick Pope’s post in the 35th minute.
Rash tackle
Newcastle’s frustration got the better of Gordon who was sent off in first-half stoppage time for a rash tackle that left stud marks on the back of van Dijk’s calf — his initial yellow card being upgraded to a red by referee Simon Hooper.
And when Hugo Ekitike, who Newcastle had wanted to sign possibly as a replacement for Isak, struck 20 seconds after the break with the sort of clinical side-foot finish that makes you wonder whether Liverpool even require more strikers, it looked all over for the hosts.
It was a curiously lethargic display by Liverpool though with Mohamed Salah unusually quiet and when Bruno Guimaraes headed past Alisson in the 57th minute the noise levels rose and Newcastle were re-energised.
Liverpool completely lost control of the game and were punished in the 88th minute as William Osula seized on defensive hesitation to nip onto a long punt forward by Pope and slot a close-range finish past Alisson.
Despite being a man down and suffering injuries to Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Fabian Schar it looked like Newcastle might grab an unlikely win but Ngumoha struck in fairytale fashion to make it two wins from two games for Liverpool.
They join Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur on six points while Newcastle, who will be desperate to settle the Isak saga before the closure of the transfer window next week, have one point from their opening two games.
“Second half we had a mountain to climb at 2-0 down with 10 men but I thought we controlled the game,” Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said.
“I thought we were really good and fought our way back unbelievably well but couldn’t get over the line.”
Howe opted not to comment on reports that Newcastle’s Saudi hierarchy had flown in for talks with Isak in a bid to resolve a saga that has been running since Liverpool had a bid of more than 100 million pounds ($135.09 million) rejected for the player who has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League games for Newcastle.
“We hope that we can bring players in,” Howe said.
“We have been trying throughout the window, especially in the forward positions.”</p><small>2025-08-26 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261035411672222.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937304/punjab-govt-opposition-spar-over-cm-maryams-japan-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt, opposition spar over CM Maryam’s Japan tour</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government and opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have been wrangling over “exorbitant spendings, chartered jet and private persons in the delegation” of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s Japan’s five-day tour.
Ms Nawaz concluded her Japan visit on Monday and reached Thailand. Questions are also being raised on social media regarding CM Maryam’s ‘official visit’ to Japan, in which ‘private individuals’, including her family members, as also a part.
It is being argued that even if such participants claim to bear their own expenses, the practice undermines the sanctity of official delegations and blurs the line between state affairs and personal interests.
Questions are also being raised on social media platforms over the inclusion of private persons as part of her visit, causing a huge sum of money to the exchequer.

Entourage comes under scrutiny; PTI’s Waqas claims bank borrowing spent on excursion; Azma says PTI will consume in its own frustration

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, who is also part of the CM delegation to Japan, rejected a list of the ‘participants’ of the CM’s visit circulating on social media, calling it “a pack of lies“.
 






She said Pakistan and Japan were entering a new era of diplomatic cooperation, but certain anti-national elements were trying to malign this relationship with disinformation and propaganda.
“For the first time, a woman CM made a ‘historic’ visit to Japan and the malicious campaign against this milestone is nothing short of a shameful act of hostility against the country’s progress. The individuals (the Sharif family members and its friends) mentioned in the
social media list were not part of the ‘official government delegation’. Only officially nominated delegates had their expenses covered by the government, while all others covered their own costs privately,” she said.
Ms Bokhari said those pained by Pakistan’s cooperation with Japan in urban development, technology, and youth skills enhancement must accept that the nation is moving forward. “The opposition PTI has nothing to offer except falsehood and propaganda. Just like in the past, it will continue to consume in its own frustration,” she added.
 






On the other hand, the PTI strongly criticised Maryam Nawaz for her foreign trip to Japan, demanding full disclosure of public funds ‘squandered’ on the tour.
“What did Punjab really gain from Maryam Nawaz’s Japan visit? Questions persist over public spending, use of a chartered jet, and the actual outcomes beyond photo optics and promises,” it asked.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram termed Maryam’s trip a “wasteful” excursion at the expense of the poor nation’s hard-earned money, undertaken when the country was navigating its ‘worst-ever’ economic crisis.
 






He pointed out that as per the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Punjab government borrowed a staggering Rs405 billion in just first 38 days of the current fiscal year 2025-26 (July 1 to August 8), which were not utilised for any public welfare rather wasted on foreign trips, lavish advertisements, and political image-building.
“The people of Pakistan demand a full and transparent disclosure of how much has been spent on these useless advertisements and foreign excursions. The ‘fake’ CM Punjab must clarify whether her Japan trip, along with dozens of cronies, family members and sycophants, was paid from her personal pocket or from the funds of the Punjab and federal governments,” he said.
Analyst Imtiaz Gul said on X: “Massive advertisement campaign on @MaryamNSharif Japan visit: Isn’t it an affront to the poor of Punjab? Has she conquered Japan? Do donors ask about the rationale of the precious funds being spent on personal projection?”
 






Earlier, a local TV channel, citing official documents, had claimed that the Punjab government allocated Rs160 million for the CM ’s Japan trip which included expenses for luxury hotel stays in Japan and Bangkok, luxury cars for transport and diplomatic gifts.
Political observers are of the view that foreign visits by elected leaders should strictly focus on advancing provincial and national interests through professional representation, rather than projecting political families. They warn that such practices not only set a poor precedent but also raise concerns of nepotism, misuse of protocol, and dilution of credibility in the eyes of international counterparts.

The NCCIA, in a notice to her, asked her to appear before an inquiry team on a complaint that she defamed the transgender community on social media. It said that in case of non-appearance, it would be assumed that she had nothing to present or state in her defence.
Lahore police last week booked around 60 transgender persons and others and arrested some of them for allegedly organising an “objectionable” private party after Maria B uploaded photos and videos of it on her social media accounts.
Later, a magistrate dismissed the case against transgender persons after no incriminating material was available on record which connected the accused persons with the commission of alleged offences.
 
 

Fashion designer Maria B initially posted videos on her social media accounts, demanding action against “transgender activists” that she claimed featured in the clips, terming such gatherings “against the moral values of the country.”
Islamabad-based transgender rights activist Nayyab Ali said in a post on X that individuals seen in the video were “not trans activists” and had “nothing to do with our movement.”
Ali also alleged that the video was shot at a private party and only went viral after Maria B posted it, saying, “If it’s fahashi (vulgarity), then who spread it to millions? Maria B did. That’s a crime itself.”
 






Human rights activists raised concerns over the potential misuse of morality laws on social media. “While obscenity laws exist, their vague wording often leads to arbitrary enforcement, disproportionately targeting marginalised communities,” said a legal expert, requesting anonymity.

This boost came from $675m in foreign loans and $19m in grants, reflecting a significant rise from last year’s $426m in loans and $10.5m in grants.
The uptick in inflows comes after the finalisation of Pakistan’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had been delayed following the approval of the federal budget. Despite this, the government was able to achieve robust growth in both loan and grant categories in July.
The target for foreign inflows in the current fiscal year has been set at $19.9 billion, slightly higher than the $19.4bn target for the previous year. This includes $6.4bn from multilateral and bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn in foreign commercial loans, as well as substantial time deposits from Saudi Arabia and China.

Pakistan receives $695m in foreign loans and grants

In July 2023, Pakistan had secured over $2.89bn in foreign loans, largely due to the signing of a 9-month Stand-By Agreement (SBA) with the IMF. This resulted in substantial inflows, including $2bn from Saudi Arabia and $1.2bn from the IMF. Overall, total inflows for July 2023 amounted to $5.1bn.
 
 

However, this year’s foreign inflows were significantly higher, with July seeing $694.53m compared to $436.39m in the same month last year. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (EAD) confirmed that out of this amount, $246.47m were for project financing, a 20pc decline from the $307m received in July 2024. On the other hand, non-project financing surged to $448m in July 2025, up almost 250pc from $129m a year earlier.
A notable development this year was the sharp increase in budget support loans, which reached $196m in July, compared to just $1.23m in the same month of 2024. This marks a record increase in budget financing, despite the annual target for budget support being set at $13.5bn for the current year, lower than last year’s target of $15bn.
Pakistan was also able to secure $100m from the Saudi Oil Facility in July, against an annual target of $1bn. The government’s overall foreign financing targets include $5bn from multilateral lenders, excluding the IMF. In July, $380m was received from multilateral lenders, up from $201m in the same month last year, reflecting an increase in multilateral support despite the reduced full-year target of $4.5bn.
Bilateral lenders, excluding the three strategic allies, contributed $118m in July, slightly surpassing the $108m from the previous year. The annual target for bilateral inflows stands at $1.36bn. Total inflows from both bilateral and multilateral sources amounted to $498.3m in July, against the annual target of $6.4bn. Last year, Pakistan had received $309m from these lenders, with an annual target of $5.05bn.
Remittances from overseas Pakistanis also saw an uptick in July, with $196.2m received through Naya Pakistan Certificates, a sharp rise from $128m in July 2024. The government has projected a total of $609m in remittances from these certificates for the current fiscal year.
The government’s ambitious $19.9bn target for foreign inflows in the current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from multilateral and bilateral sources, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn in foreign commercial loans, and substantial contributions from strategic allies, including $5bn from Saudi Arabia in time deposits and $4bn in SAFE deposits from China.

The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex were down about 0.7pc each at 24,787 and 81,028.63 points, respectively, as of 10:39am IST (10:09am PKT).
The benchmarks traded little changed for the month, on top of a nearly 3pc drop in July.
Fifteen of the 16 major sectors traded lower on the day. The broader mid-caps and small-caps declined about 1pc each.
Indian exports will face US duties of up to 50pc — among the highest imposed by Washington — after President Donald Trump announced extra tariffs as a punishment for New Delhi’s increased purchases of Russian oil earlier in August.
“While this is sentimentally negative for the market, we do not expect deeper correction from hereon as it is not shocking news,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of retail research at ICICI Securities.
Reliance Industries, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Nifty 50, fell about 1pc. Heavyweight financials fell 1.1pc and pharma stocks were down 1.4pc.
Shares of textile, chemicals and shrimp companies also inched lower as these sectors are expected to be hit the most from US tariffs.
“We are likely to see a sector/stock specific market going ahead as export-oriented stocks may remain under pressure due to tariff overhang, while domestic themes could gain traction on consumption boost,” Pandey said.

Both interior and railways’ ministries also agreed to launch Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) — a modern shuttle train — between Islamabad and Rawalpindi to provide better facilities to the passengers.
“We are ready to provide you our FC for launching joint operations to retrieve the precious commercial [railway] land from grabbers, in major cities,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told railways minister Hanif Abbasi during a meeting held here at the PR headquarters on Monday.
During the meeting, Mr Naqvi was briefed about the railway system, projects and revenue generation, etc by senior officers. He was also apprised of the challenges being faced by the department and strategies to overcome these problems.

The federal force will also be used to retrieve railway land from grabbers

Mr Abbasi, on the occasion, told the interior minister about the upgrade of various railway stations, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Khanewal, Okara and Faisalabad.
 
 

While discussing the issue of absence of any shuttle train service between the twin cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad Margala stations), Mr Naqvi assured Mr Abbasi that senior officials of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) would soon contact the railway’s officers concerned to discuss a plan in this regard.
In response, Mr Abbasi agreed to launch a DMU shuttle train between the twin cities.
According to a senior PR officer, DMU train consists of two specially designed small locomotives attached to a rake of 4-5 modern coaches on the front and rear ends, having a capacity to carry around 400 passengers.
During the meeting, the security measures for the PR assets were reviewed in detail. The interior minister was briefed on special measures taken for the security of railway lines and trains across the country, particularly in Balochistan.
“Every possible measure will be taken to ensure a foolproof security of railway tracks and trains, and full assistance will be provided to the Railway Police,” said Mr Naqvi, adding that the passengers’ safety was his top priority.
He also appreciated the measures taken by Mr Abbasi to improve the PR’s performance.
The PR Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aamir Ali Baloch, Inspector General of Railway Police Rai Tahir and other senior officials also attended the meeting.
“The meeting remained very productive, as the interior minister has agreed to provide us FC troops for launching a coordinated operation to retrieve our precious commercial land and eliminate encroachments,” Mr Abbasi told Dawn after the meeting.
Meanwhile, Mr Abbasi reprimanded the PR’s mechanical department for slackness in resolving various issues. “The rolling stock is the lifeline of the railway, and all efforts to keep it running in good condition must be made,” he said while presiding over a meeting.
“Nothing should be pushed under the carpet, as everything must be crystal clear,” he said, adding that the officers concerned should avoid buying any parts for the trains without the third-party evaluation.

• City can’t handle even 10mm of rains with choked drains, says urban planner
KARACHI: Expressing serious concerns over the way the metropolis has been governed for the past several decades, civil society representatives said on Monday that the death, devastation and public chaos Karachi experiences with every monsoon have more to do with bad governance — corruption, inefficiency and absence of political will — rather than climate change.
The civil society held a press conference under the platform of the Karachi Citizens’ Forum (KCF) at the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) House, where one of the speakers emphasised the need for what he called a supra provincial body to run Karachi.
Describing the situation as “depressing”, the speakers said that cost-efficient solutions to urban flooding were available and that there was no dearth of skilled and talented manpower in the city to implement them to help minimise rain damages.
 
 

“We need a strong political will to fix the city’s most basic problems. The continued official neglect towards the sewerage and drainage system has led to a situation where monsoons have become a source of fear and devastation,” said KCF convener Nargis Rehman.
She urged the civic authorities to learn from other countries and improve city’s fragile civic infrastructure.
The city, she pointed out, was run by 21 different agencies that took action only after damage, adding that the Met department’s warnings of heavier than usual rains were ignored this year, too, and timely steps, including cleaning of choked drains, were not taken.
Highlighting flaws, urban planner and researcher Muhammad Toheed stated that there was no question of flooding in Karachi, if its geology, natural slope and terrain had been considered in its growth and development.
“The city has 38 big drains and over 500 small drains. The operational maintenance of most of these drains is the responsibility of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). The problem started in 1996 when the [then] Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) turned the big storm water drains, meant for discharge of rainwater, into sewer channels, instead of upgrading its network.
“Furthermore, storm water drains were heavily encroached upon and narrowed down, reducing their capacity. The path of these channels was completely ignored in the construction of development projects, including flyovers, underpasses and Bus Rapid Transit ventures, resulting in flooding in many areas.”
‘Drains being used for dumping solid waste’
Another problem, he said, was using storm water drains for dumping solid waste. “Hence, the KMC, KWSB and Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, all need to collaborate to tackle the issue.”
Citing a World Bank report that states Karachi has the capacity to handle 30mm to 40mm rain, Mr Toheed said the city would have this capacity with cleaned and not choked drains. “In the present situation, the city can’t handle even 10mm of rains,” he remarked.
Giving examples of other global cities, Mr Toheed said they adopted different strategies, including establishment of deep tunnels and underground flood water diversion systems and making use of latest drainage technology.
 
 

“First of all, we need to have a proactive approach. Second, we should think of harvesting rainwater and replenishing our underground water reservoirs, given the fact that the city faces serious water scarcity. We can take a cue on this from Lahore where three million gallons of rainwater is now collected in tanks,” he said.
He warned that there might not be water tankers after five years in the city, while citing example of Gulshan-i-Rafi in Malir where water table had gone down to 600 feet.
‘Supra provincial body’
Senior journalist Mazhar Abbas said he saw no hope for the city, given the fact that Karachi was not in the government priority list and corruption marred all state departments.
According to him, the rampant illegal construction of high-rises without first devising a system for sewerage and drainage and encroachments of drains, has destroyed the city.
Retired Justice Shaiq Usmani spoke of the need for setting up a “supra provincial body”, representing all sectors, overseeing Karachi’s administration.
In their remarks, Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro of the PMA and Dr Qaiser Sajjad of KCF said that the present situation was a man-made disaster.
“It’s time for action. We need to invest in a robust, modern drainage system. We need to enforce strict anti-encroachment laws and set up a sustainable waste management system,” Dr Shoro said.

• Joint venture awarded contract despite past disqualification for non-performance
• Senate committee gives NHA two days to provide documents or face contract cancellation
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended eight senior officials of the National Highway Authority (NHA) and formed a high level inquiry committee to probe into glaring irregularities, mala fide intension, ghost tendering, collusive practices and alleged corrupt practices in award of Rs170 billion international road project under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III.
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Com­mi­ttee on Economic Affairs Division  (EAD),  in its meeting on Monday, gave a two-day deadline to the NHA  to clarify its position through documentary evidence demonstrating transparency in the award of the contract. Failing that, the committee  recommended cancellation of the contract and disqualification of the  successful joint venture (JV).
The committee questioned how the PM’s inquiry committee would reach a decision, given that the NHA had failed to provide relevant documents to the Senate committee for the past four months.
 






The case is already under investigation by five parliamentary committees — from both the Senate and the National Assembly — as well as the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). All have identified serious violations of rules and corrupt practices in awarding the four lots of the CAREC Tranche-III project, which is being funded by the Asian Development Bank.
A notification from the PM Office available with Dawn, which was also presented before the standing committee on Monday, revealed that nine NHA officials were suspended. Those suspended include member engineering Asim Amin, member Imtiaz Ahmed Khokhar, Muham­mad Talha, director engineering, and four officials of the procurement department. A recently retired member Samiur Rehman is also facing the inquiry.
The document said: “In pursuance of Prime Minister’s Office U.O No. 2(90)/DS(EA-I)/2025 dated 21-08-2025, the prime minister has been pleased to constitute the following committee on the above subject (to review award of contract of CAREC-Tranche-III Project).”
 
 

The inquiry committee includes retired federal secretary Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmed (convener); Commerce Division secretary; retired NHA member Mukhtar Ahmed Durrani; retired chief engineer Akbar Ali and the member Planning Commission.
The terms of reference of the inquiry committee are: (a) review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; (b) examine whether NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of CAREC Tranche-III project; (c) assess whether NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process in a transparent and judicious manner; (d) evaluate all stages in award of project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; (e) suggest way forward on the current process; (f) review any other matter ancillary to the above.
The document further said the committee shall submit a comprehensive report with actionable recommendations to PM Office within one week. The Ministry of Communications shall act as secretariat to the committee.
Interestingly, the contract for the four lots of CAREC Tranche-III was awarded to a JV of NXCC, Dynamics Constructors, and Rustam Associates, despite this JV being disqualified two years ago by the NHA for failing to complete a previous CAREC project on time.
The parliamentary committees have given ample time to the NHA to provide relevant documents to substantiate the eligibility, financial and technical soundness of the JV firms and no violation to PPRA, and even NHA’s rules, in the award of the contract, but the authority remained failed to provide such documents and bent upon confusing the lawmakers and senior officials of different ministries and PPRA.
CAREC Tranche-I, II, and III projects are in various stages of completion. Tranche-III consists of four road segments: Lot-1 (is 58km road from Rajanpur to Jampur), Lot-2 (64km from Jampur to D.G. Khan), Lot-3 (112km from D.G. Khan to Tibbi Qaisrani), and Lot-4 (96km from Tibbi Qaisrani to D.I. Khan).
 
 

In the previous meeting of the Senate committee on EAD, held on Aug 2, the NHA was given a final 15-day deadline to come up with all documents required by the committee. However, even after the deadline the NHA could not present the relevant documents in the committee’s meeting on Monday.
NHA Chairman Sheharyar Sultan apprised the committee that responses to certain questions were still awaited from the relevant firms and departments, while some information had already been submitted to the Ministry of Communications.
‘Very serious matter’
Senator Kamil Ali Agha termed the suspension of officers on a large scale a “very serious matter” and demanded clarity. The committee was of the view that the charge sheet against the officers must have been attached with the notifications issued by the Cabinet Division and the PM Office.
Turning to the Shandoor-Gilgit road project (under CAREC Tran­che-I), Senator Saifullah Abro said: “You people cannot even defend this project.”
He said the contract had been awarded in Dec 2021 and Feb 2022. He expressed shock that the same firm — Ningxia Commu­nic­a­tions Construction Company — which had been disqualified from ADB’s CAREC Tranche-II (Shik­ar­pur-Rajanpur) project and Yarik-Zhob project for submitting fake documents and forged seal stamps, was awarded the Shandoor-Gilgit project.

Chaired by Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, the committee was told that the closure of USC had been finalised, but safeguarding the rights of the app­roximately 11,000 workers was the government’s top priority. The committee sought a detailed breakdown of the outstanding dues to be paid to employees and vendors, which the Privatisation Commission was asked to submit at the next meeting.
The committee was also briefed that while USC had operated profitably when subsidies were being provided, the withdrawal of these subsidies had led to operational losses. Committee members expressed serious concerns over the privatisation of USC, emphasising that continuing with the closure process despite the committee’s recommendations was highly alarming.
In response, the Privatisation Commission’s secretary inf­ormed the committee that the due diligence process for the privatisation of Pakistan Inter­national Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) had already begun, with several business houses expressing interest. The privatisation process for PIA is expected to be completed by the last quarter of 2025.

Govt commits Rs27bn in dues clearance to employees, vendors

The committee directed that the process be conducted transparently and asked the Privatisation Commission to present a list of members of the privatisation board at the next meeting.
On the ongoing issue of electricity loadshedding, the committee expressed concern over the situation across the country. The committee was informed that there is no electricity shortfall, but load management is being carried out. Feeders experiencing electricity theft or excessive line losses are subjected to load management.
 
 

The committee advised that instead of imposing load-shedding on entire feeders, electricity should be disconnected only for those areas or consumers found involved in theft or causing excessive losses.
Additionally, the committee recommended that the Minister for Power hold regional meetings with members of the National Assembly to address public issues in their constituencies and take concrete actions to resolve them.Following a briefing on Pakistan Engineering Company (PECO), the committee instructed the government to resolve the company’s issues.
The committee advised that efforts should first focus on restoring PECO, but if that proves unfeasible, privatisation should be considered. The committee also directed an inquiry into the irregularities during the tenure of former Managing Director Mairaj Anees Ariff and requested a detailed report on the matter.

A notification issued by the Establishment Divi­sion stated: “Major  Gen­eral Noor Wali Khan, HI (M), is transferred and posted as Additional  Secretary (BS-21), Interior and Narcotics Control Division, on  secondment basis for a period of three years, with immediate effect and  until further orders.”
The notification has been circulated to the Prime Minister’s Office, President Secretariat, Cabinet Division, Establishment Division, interior ministry, defence ministry, and other relevant departments.
In July, Minister Naqvi had signaled his intention to induct a  serving army officer into the interior ministry, citing the need for  effective coordination between civil armed forces — which report to the  ministry — and the military in counterterrorism operations.

Appointment comes a month after Naqvi signalled intention to hire serving officer for effective coordination between civil armed forces and military

The  paramilitary and civil armed forces under the ministry’s administrative  control include the Frontier Corps, Rangers, Pakistan Coast Guards,  Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, and the newly-established Federal Constabulary.  All of them are actively engaged in counterterrorism and  counter-insurgency operations across the country.
Sources said that Maj Gen Khan has previously held key military and intelligence assignments.
His predecessor, Sohail Habib Tajik — a BS-21 officer of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) — has been relieved of his responsibilities and directed to report to the Establishment Division, without being assigned any new portfolio.
A parallel notification read: “Sohail Habib Tajik, presently serving as Additional Secretary Interior and Narcotics Control Division, on deputation basis, is transferred and directed to report to Establishment Division, with immediate effect and until further orders.”
 
 

Tajik had been serving as Ad­­ditional Secretary Administra­tion, while Nazar Mohammad Buzdar holds the post of Additional Secre­tary Internal and Foreigners Secu­rity, and Salman Chaudhry is serving as Additional Secretary Border Management.
Mr Tajik, a senior PSP officer, has not been given any portfolio following his posting from the prime post of the Ministry of Interior.
Following the induction of Maj Gen Khan, sources said, further reshuffling within the ministry is expected.

Issues related to the Pakistan Hockey Federation came under discussion during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter Provincial Coordination here at the Parliament House with MNA Mohammad Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel in the chair.
During the course of the meeting, IPC secretary Mohyuddin Wani informed that the Ministry of Finance had confirmed that it will provide Rs250m to ensure Pakistan’s first-ever participation in the Pro League.
Wani added that while the PHF had demanded Rs350m, the government had said that the country’s hockey governing body should arrange the remaining amount through sponsorship.
He later told Dawn that funding would not be handed directly to the PHF but instead the Pakistan Sports Board will oversee it to ensure transparency.
 






Pakistan had been invited by the International Hockey Federation to participate in the Pro League after Nations Cup winners New Zealand, who beat the national side in the final, withdrew due to financial constraints.
It offered Pakistan the opportunity to play against the world’s top sides but with relations between the PSB and the PHF having been soured over the latter’s lack of accountability there were question marks over whether the government will ensure funding.
The committee also raised question marks over the legitimacy of incumbent PHF management as President Tariq Hussain Bugti was appointed by the interim prime minister.
The committee decided that inputs from the law secretary and Attorney General of Pakistan should be taken to ascertain if the interim prime minister was mandated to remove or appoint anyone as PHF chief.
 
 

Allegations against the PHF chief and secretary Rana Mujahid have been levelled by several Olympians, while MNA Shehla Raza, attending as a special invitee, stated that 100 audit paras related to corruption against the PHF are pending and the Federal Investigation Agency should complete this probe.
Tariq was recently asked by the PHF to justify the continued failure to hold PHF’s elections and explain his inaction on the inquiry report concerning the authorised bank accounts.
Details over the PHF’s income, including that through rented property and its utilisation, were also sought from the president, who was asked to justify the “unauthorised perks, and administrative expenditure drawn by PHF office bearers”.
Bugti told reporters following the committee meeting that he will provide complete details.
After hearing all stakeholders, a sub-committee under the convenorship of MNA Sheikh Aftab Ahmed was formed to examine the legal status of the PHF as well as the issues related to financial irregularities.
The sub-committee will be assisted by the Secretaries of the Ministry of Law and IPC, the Director General, Pakistan Sports Board, a representative from the Office of the Attorney General, as well as the president and secretary of the PHF.

During a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Society, chaired by re­­tired Lt General Abdul Qayyum Malik, it was pointed out that many old pensioners receive no more than Rs12,000 per month, while widows get as little as Rs9,000 — amounts grossly inadequate even for basic subsistence.
The PESS urged the government to end this long-standing injustice by revising pensions at least to the level of the minimum wage (Rs37,000), ensuring financial dignity and security for those who sacrificed for the nation.
The meeting was attended by Vice Admiral Abdul Aleem, Air Marshal Pervaiz Nawaz, Lt Gen M. Afzal, Brig Tariq SJ, Brig Zafar along with other officers, JCOs, and PESS supporting staff.
The meeting condem­n­­ed the malicious and venomous propaganda being spr­ead on social media aga­­inst armed forces of the country and their leadership.
The Society also condemned India’s continued involvement in fuelling insurgency and sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan’s western provinces.
It commended the government for its successful foreign policy initiatives, particularly in maintaining a balanced and constructive approach in relations with major world powers.

The meeting will be the second since Iran’s 12-day war with Israel in mid-June, during which the United States carried out strikes against Tehran’s nuclear facilities. The previous round of talks was held in Istanbul on July 25.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, the Kremlin said on Monday, in which the pair “touched on the situation around Iran’s nuclear programme”.
 
 

It did not elaborate on what the pair discussed.
The Iranian presidency said Pezeshkian had thanked Putin for supporting Tehran’s “right to enrichment” and said Iran was “not seeking, and will never seek to build nuclear weapons”.
The two countries have bolstered political, military and economic ties during Russia’s military offensive on Ukraine.
Iran has regularly sought to coordinate its position with both Russia and China before key nuclear talks with the United States and Europe during the current stand-off.
Russia’s Kommersant business paper reported on Monday that Moscow opposed the idea of “snapback” sanctions.

outgoing EU envoy Riina Kionka

ISLAMABAD: Noting a deteriorating human rights climate, outgoing European Union Ambassador Riina Kionka has called on Pakistan to show ‘credible’ and ‘visible progress’ on human rights and labour reforms ahead of a crucial trade assessment in November, signalling that the EU’s next trade preference scheme will demand stronger compliance.
Speaking to Dawn days before leaving Islamabad, Kionka said the upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission, which had been delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict, will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
“Pakistan needs to show more visible progress especially ahead of the upcoming GSP Plus monitoring mission in November,” she said.
 
 

“Governance is looking pretty good, (progress on) environment also positive. But labour rights need more work, and human rights remain the most challenging area.”

EU envoy says crucial trade assessment due in November

On human rights, she was blunt: “If you talk to many human rights defenders, civil society activists —and even just live here, like I have for three years — you often see … a clear degradation. Our monitors read the newspapers. They have networks, they know what’s going on. So, they’re in a position to judge whether things are moving in the right direction or not.”
European lawmakers and civil society, she added, are increasingly vocal about conditioning trade support on rights performance: “Why should we continue to offer this level of support if there’s no reciprocal progress on the values side?”
Despite what she described as “quiet diplomacy” between EU and Pakistan on sensitive issues like human rights, Kionka has sometimes been vocal on these issues.
 
 

“If we can’t support them (human rights activists) effectively because they’re being silenced or intimidated, then we lose a key channel of communication, a way to engage in dialogue and debate,” she said while explaining the reason for taking strong positions adding “civil society is essential to the EU’s human rights policy. It’s how we project values. It’s how we engage.”
The GSP+ programme is a lifeline for Pakistan’s export sector, with the scheme delivering 83pc growth in exports to EU since its inception. But Kionka stressed that the arran­gement is “a two-sided equation — one side is trade, which has been very successful. The other is susta­i­n­­able development and we need to see credible progress on both fronts.”
The EU measures progress towa­rds sustainability through active implementation of the 27 conventi­ons Pakistan has pledged to uphold, covering human rights, labour rights, governance and environmental standards, the diplomat noted.
She welcomed the Senate’s recent vote to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death, calling it “encouraging”, but urged further movement on freedom of religion and belief, freedom of expression, and the right to assembly.
The EU is finalising a new GSP+ regulation for 2024–2034 that will require all current beneficiaries to reapply before the next cycle begins by 2027. The revised framework, Kionka said, will introduce “a more efficient way of addressing ongoing concerns”.
The proposed regulation will give Brussels more flexibility to withdraw benefits in cases of serious, systematic violations including climate and environmental breaches.
“Once the new regulation comes into force, Pakistan will have to reapply and submit an action plan — a roadmap explaining how it intends to meet the required milestones,” she said. “It doesn’t roll over automatically.”
 
 

The proposed regulation will also have an expanded list of conventions to include children’s rights, disability rights, and stricter labour inspection regimes. The widened scope and expedited withdrawal me­­chanism could, meanwhile, make it more challenging for countries with weak compliance to stay in the scheme.
As she departs after three years, a tenure that started after the 2022 floods for which the EU mobilised nearly €1 billion in aid and ends with yet another episode of devastating floods, the envoy pointed to structural weaknesses in the trade relationship.
“About 75pc of Pakistan’s exports to the EU are textiles. There are ma­­ny other industries that could also benefit from GSP+,” she said, urg­ing diversification and value addition.
She also emphasised the need for political stability and plurality “to get things done and maintain long-term partnerships”, and highlighted the EU-Pakistan Business Network — a platform for European investors — as an unfinished project she hopes her successor will formally launch.

The question was answered in the negative by the Delhi High Court on Monday, which quashed the Central Information Commission’s 2016 order permitting a RTI activist to look at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s B.A. records, assuming the records exist.
The court quashed the order that would have enabled the RTI activist to inspect Delhi University’s 1978 B.A. records, the year Narendra Modi graduated, The Hindu said.
“Something which is of interest to the public” is quite different from “something which is in the public interest”, Justice Sac­­hin Dutta remarked as he set aside the CIC’s Dec 21, 2016 order.
In the 175-page combined judgement, Justice Datta also ruled against the CIC’s order asking the CBSE to share Class X and XII records of BJP leader Smriti Irani to a RTI applicant, saying, “there is no implicit public interest in respect of the information sought.”

Observes something which is of ‘interest to public’ is different from something in ‘public interest’

Mr Modi has been quoted as giving different accounts of his educational qualifications, but it is baffling why his claim of being a graduate should not be verified on behalf of a curious public.
On the RTI plea of activist Neeraj, the CIC had ordered Delhi University (DU) to allow inspection of its register containing details of all students who passed the B.A. examination in 1978 — including their roll numbers, names, fathers’ names and marks — and to provide certified extracts of the relevant pages.
 
 

After the DU challenged the CIC’s order, the court stayed it on the very first hearing, Jan 24, 2017.
In its plea, the DU had contended that it cannot reveal details of personal information of all students, who had appeared in Bachelor of Arts in the year 1978, the year Mr Modi cleared the degree.
The DU had argued that the information of students is held in “fiduciary capacity, the same is exempt from disclosure” under the RTI Act. The university said the CIC order had “far-reaching adverse consequences” for all universities that held degrees of crores of students.
Justice Dutta agreed with the DU’s contention, noting the “court cannot be oblivious to the reality that what may superficially appear to be an innocuous or isolated disclosure could open the floodgates of indiscriminate demands, motivated by idle curiosity or sensationalism, rather than any objective “public interest” consideration.”
“The fact that the information sought pertains to a public figure does not extinguish privacy/confidentiality rights over personal data, unconnected with public duties,” the court added.
Justice Dutta said: “Such data, which pertains to various facets of a student’s academic life, is held by the university in trust and confidence, and there is a legitimate expectation on the part of the students that confidentiality shall be maintained with regard thereto”.
Previously, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the DU, argued that the purpose of RTI was not to satiate a third party’s curiosity.
“Section 6 provides a mandate that information will have to be given, that is the purpose. But the RTI Act is not for the purpose of satisfying someone’s curiosity,” Mr Mehta had argued.
The CIC, in its order, told the DU to allow inspection and rejected the argument of its public information officer that it was third party personal information, observing there was “neither merit, nor legality” in it.

GAZA: Five journalists were among at least 20 people killed on Monday when Israeli strikes hit a hospital in the south, prompting a global outcry.
Reuters, the Associated Press and Al Jazeera all issued statements mourning their slain contributors, while the Israeli military said it would investigate the incident.
The war on Gaza has been one of the deadliest for journalists, with aro­u­nd 200 media workers kil­led over the course of the nearly two-year Israeli assault, according to media watchdogs.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said  “the toll so far is 20 martyrs, including five journalists and one member of the civil defence”, after strikes hit Khan Yunis’s Nasser Hospital — a large medical complex that has been targeted several times by Israel.
Bassal said an Israeli exp­losive drone hit a buil­d­ing at the hospital, followed by an air strike as the wounded were being evacuated.
Reuters reported that vi­­d­­eo journalist Hussam al-Masri — a contractor who was working for the agency — was operating a live feed at the hospital,  “which suddenly shut down at the mo­­ment of the initial strike”.
A Reuters spokesperson said the agency was  “devastated” to learn of Masri’s death “and injuries to another of our contractors, Hatem Khaled” in the strikes.
“We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” the statement added.
A spokesperson for Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera said one of its photojournalists and cameramen, Mohammad Sala­­ma, was also killed in the attack.
“Al Jazeera Media Network condemns, in the strongest possible terms, this horrific crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces, who have dir­ectly targeted and assassinated journalists as part of a systematic campaign to silence the truth,” the broa­dcaster said in a statement.
 
 

The Associated Press said in a statement that it was “shocked and sadde­ned” to learn of the death of Mariam Dagga, 33, a visual journalist who had freelanced for the agency since the start of the war.
The Palestinian Journa­lists Syndicate named two other victims as Moaz Abu Taha and Ahmad Abu Aziz.
 
 

Later Monday, a sixth journalist, Hassan Douhan, was killed by Isra­eli fire in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syn­dicate and Nasser Hospital.
AFP footage from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed smoke filling the air and debris from the blast on the floor outside the hospital.
Palestinians rushed to help the victims, carrying bloodied corpses and severed body parts into the medical complex. One body could be seen dangling from the top floor of the targeted building as a man screamed below.
A woman wearing medical scrubs and a white coat was among the injured, carried into the hospital on a stretcher with a heavily bandaged leg and blood all over her clothes.
Later in the day, a crowd carried the bodies of some of the slain journalists at a funeral in Khan Yunis, with the dead wrapped in white burial shrouds and their press flak jackets resting on top.

At least seven terrorists were also killed, officials and sources said.
In Upper Dir and Lower Dir districts, officials and sources said five suspected militants were killed and seven policemen injured late on Sunday night during fierce clashes between the security forces and the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP). They said the exchange of fire in the Dobando area of Upper Dir continued for several hours. Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.
A senior official of the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) of police told Dawn that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he said.
In Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.
Police officials, however, claimed the situation was under control. “We will never bow down to the mischief of the Kharijites (militants),” a police officer said.

Three civilians among the slain; seven terrorists killed in Upper Dir, Hangu engagements

Cop martyred in Bajaur
In Bajaur district, a policeman from Lower Dir was martyred in militant firing. Head Constable Shah Wazir Khan was laid to rest in his ancestral village Chansaruno Talash wit­h official honours. Besides Lower Dir District Police Offi­cer Abdul Salam Khalid, SP Elite Force Fahd Khan, Col Abrar of 184 Wing Dir Scouts, other security officials and lo­cal elders, a large number of area people attended the funeral.
Speaking on the occasion, DPO Khalid said the sacrifice of the fallen policeman would never be forgotten. He assured that the police would continue to stand by the families of martyrs in all circumstances.
Hangu, Khyber attacks
In Hangu district, militants mounted a late-night attack on the Tora Warai FC fort. As a result, two personnel of Hangu scouts were martyred, while several others were injured. In the ensuing gun battle, two militants were also killed.
In Tirah valley of Khyber district, two soldiers were martyred in a terrorist attack on a security post.
Sources said that an unspecified number of armed militants attacked the post of an army unit, resulting in the martyrdom of Lance Naik Ali Hasan Jan and Sepoy Nabi Jan. The attackers, however, fled when the security forces retaliated. Later, a search operation was conducted in the region as residents were asked to stay indoors.
 
 

Later, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi along with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, FC Commandant Riaz Nazir Gara and other officials attended the funeral of the personnel who embraced martyrdom in Hangu. The interior minister said the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain as he met families of the martyrs.
 
 

Mr Naqvi also visited the FC Hospital to inquire about the health of Naib Subedar Kashif who sustained injuries. “You have set an unforgettable example of bravery and repelled the enemy’s attack. The way you fought against Indian-sponsored terrorists is highly commendable. We all stand with you and will always remain by your side,” he said.
Cop targeted in Jamrud
In Jamrud, a policeman was martyred in a firing incident, police said.
Officials said that armed men targeted Khurshid Khan in Ghundi area of Jamrud and fled. While police were ascertaining the motive for the shooting, they have not ruled out the possibility of a family feud.
Quadcopter strike in N. Waziristan
In North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area, a two-year-old boy was martyred and his grandmother injured in a quadcopter strike on a house on Monday.
According to sources, the quadcopter targeted a house in the Barokhel village of Mir Ali. As a result, a minor child, Sahir Tufail, son of Kashif Jan, was martyred and his grandmother was injured. The injured woman was shifted to Mir Ali hospital.

• Insiders say fear of losing majority in KP Assembly, ceding political space in Punjab behind ‘change of heart’
• Drama unfolds after Monday’s meeting as Salman Akram Raja announces decision to quit as secy general
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A tug of war within the opposition PTI over whether to participate in the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assembly seats — vacated after the recent disqualifications of a number of key lawmakers — will weigh heavily on party leaders as they meet Imran Khan today for a final decision in the matter.
Insiders told Dawn the party’s political committee — in its meeting on Monday — had a change of heart after a majority of members voted against the decision to boycott by-polls.
This goes against the opinion reportedly expressed by incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, whose sister Aleema has conveyed on a couple of occasions his intention to steer clear of by-elections, so that the party isn’t seen as legitimising the process.
The party has already obtained stay orders against the de-seating of key opposition leaders, such as Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz. It has also, albeit reluctantly, nominated replacements while the party pursues legal options.
But faced with threats on multiple fronts — including the possible loss of maj­o­rity in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly due to future disqualifications, a push to reclaim political space in Punjab, and a showdown between two opposing camps within the party — it seems as if the PTI may throw its hat in the ring, despite all misgivings about the by-elections. According to sources privy to proceedings, Monday’s meeting of the political committee voted 12-9 in favour of fielding candidates for the upcoming by-elections.
Additionally, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram announced that all candidates would be issued tickets under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which appears to be an insurance policy of sorts, to offset chances of them being declared ‘independent candidates’, since the dispute around PTI’s intra-party elections and the matter of its electoral symbol are still in limbo.
Three meetings with Imran
Aleema Khan had clearly stated after meeting with the former prime minister that Mr Khan did not want to field any candidates for the by-elections. If they did, it would appear to be an insult, disrespecting and dishonouring leaders who had been disqualified. This message was also shared Mr Khan’s official X account — even though the former PM does not personally have access to social media.
However, a majority of the party leaders were in favour of contesting by-elections. So, Mr Khan was approached once again through his sisters, and he repeated the same message, sources said.
But, in the last meeting between Imran and his legal team, Naeem Haider Panjotha called up Advocate Ali Bukhari — another member of the legal team —saying that Mr Khan wanted to meet him.
According to one account, it was Mr Bukhari who prevailed on the party founder to reconsider his stance, saying that in case any legislators from KP are disqualified in the coming days and the PTI does not field any candidates, it may stand to lose its majority in KP. Observers feel that while the PTI is under a lot of pressure in Punjab, there is no looming threat to the party in KP, partly because only a handful of the sitting or former MPAs have been nominated in cases where they may face disqualification.
In addition, the provincial government-appointed prosecutors are less inclined to push these cases in courts, which are widely seen are being comparatively lenient towards the party.
This is also a reason why many parliamentarians, who are facing prosecution in Punjab, have either taken up sanctuary in KP or approached the Peshawar High Court for legal relief.
Mr Bukhari reportedly also asked Mr Khan about fielding candidates for the vacant posts of opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, and the Punjab Assembly. This issue, the founder had instructed, should be discussed the by political committee, and suggested that if candidates are to be fielded, Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Azam Swati should be considered.
Drama in political committee
During Monday’s meeting, it emerged that a majority of leaders were in favour of not ceding political space to the ruling parties.
A fear was expressed that PTI legislators from KP could be disqualified in Nov 26 cases, after which the party may not be able to hold on to the provincial government. Once the KP government goes, things will become more difficult for the party, sources said.
In addition, PTI leaders were confident that they could easily win elections in KP. However, when Sheikh Waqqas Akram shared the party’s decision on social media, it triggered a wave of criticism from across the globe. When approached, Mr Akram confirmed that he, Salman Akram Raja and a few others were against the decision, but they had to go with the majority.
In a dramatic turn of events, however, Salman Akram Raja tweeted his intention to step down from the post of secretary general, saying he would request Imran Khan to accept his resignation when the two met on Tuesday (today).
Although he did not specify what prompted him to take this decision, the timing of his tweet indicated that the “incident” he referred to was — in all probability — the political committee’s decision to contest by-polls. “Tomorrow I will resign from my position by requesting Khan sahib. My legal services will remain available without compensation,” he wrote on X.
 






Talking to Dawn, former Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar said that the fog around whether to contest by-elections or not would be cleared up when lawyers meet Imran Khan in Adiala Jail today (Tuesday). He also voiced support for elements who feel that the party should not leave the field open in Punjab by boycotting polls. “While going into elections on around 14 provincial and national assembly constituencies, the PTI will be doing a lot of political activity, which would definitely expose the government if it tried to rig these elections,” he said.
Candidates withdraw
Meanwhile, three PPP candidates have withdrawn their nomination papers for by-elections in Punjab, in favour of PML-N nominees, as per a recent agreement between the two parties. A PPP spokesperson said that candidates had withdrawn their candidatures for National Assembly constituencies NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-66 (Wazirabad), as well as the Punjab Assembly constituency PP-87 (Mianwali).

• At least 10 districts on high alert as more than 24,000 relocated amid flooding of low-lying areas; heavy rain likely in next two days
• GB villagers await govt help to ease their suffering; three locals rewarded for timely Glof warning; PM likely to visit region tomorrow
LAHORE/GILGIT: As Punjab braces for a “high flood” in almost all eastern rivers prompting mass evacuations, thousands of people affected by glacial and flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan earlier this month await government’s help amid a shortage of essentials.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that more than 24,000 people had been relocated from the low-lying areas of the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers since Saturday. These rivers were experiencing low to high flooding due to torrential monsoon rains in the catchment areas and more rain was expected over the next 48 hours.
The evacuation operation was conducted in Kasur, Okara, Pakp­a­ttan, Bahawalnagar, Ve­hari, and Narowal, Mr Ahmad said, as a high alert had been issued in Kasur, Okara, Pakpa­ttan, Bahaw­a­lnagar, Vehari, and Narowal in light of a flood alert by India.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued a flood alert in Punjab due to heavy rains. There is a risk of flooding in the upper reaches of these rivers due to heavy rain likely in the next 48 hours. There is a risk of “high to very high” flooding in the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, whereas urban flooding was also expected in the Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Gujranwala divisions.
‘High-level flooding’
A high-level flooding warning had been issued at the Harike location of the Sutlej River: the upstream and downstream areas of Harike were facing a high-level flood situation. The water flow in the Sutlej and adjacent rivers would further increase.
There was a low flood situation at Kalabagh and Chashma in the Indus River, while the water flow was at a normal level at Tarbela and Taunsa. There was a high flood situation at Ganda Singh Wala in the Sutlej River and a medium flood at Sul­emanki. Similarly, there was a medium flood situation at Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River. About reservoirs, Tarbela Dam was completely full, while Mangla Dam was 76pc. Among the Indian dams, Bhakra was 80pc, Pong 87pc, and Thein Dam was 85pc full.
Separately, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) issued a flood alert for the River Ravi over the next 48 hours, indicating a medium-level threat. According to hydrological data, sustained moderate to heavy rainfall in the catchments of River Ravi and associated nullahs had resulted in increased inflows at Thein Dam, which had reached 1,717 feet. As of Monday, River Ravi at Kot Naina was discharging 64,000 cusecs and may cause “low to medium” floods at Jassar within 24 hours, with the potential to escalate to high flood levels if additional spillway releases occurred along with continued rainfall activity till August 27.
In light of possible flooding, the PDMA is­­sued instructions to the district administrations concerned to remain alert, while an alert had also been issued to the commissioners of Lah­ore, Sahiwal, Multan, Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan. The deputy commissioners of Kasur, Oka­­ra, Pakpattan, Vehari, Baha­wal­nagar, Lod­hran, Bahawalpur, Multan and Mu­­zaffargarh were also put on alert in light of floods.
Meanwhile, the PDMA issued a fact sheet on the monsoon flood situation, including statistics on rains, rivers, dams, and the flood situation.In the last 24 hours, Narowal 27mm, Sialkot 5mm, Kasur 4mm, Lahore and Gujranwala 3mm, while Gujrat and Khanewal recorded up to 1mm of rain.
GB awaits help
Residents in several tehsils of Ghizer remained isolated for the fourth day due to the blockaded Gilgit-Shandur Road — a five-kilometre section of the artery had been submerged in last week’s glacial flood that created an artificial lake in Raushan village in Ghizer.
Mohammad Karim, a resident, said 300 houses damaged by the flash flood had been submerged by the lake, and villagers in Hakis, Thangi, and Raushan remained without basic necessities. The locals complained that they had been uprooted from their homes, but still did not get any relief from the government. The people were living without electricity, potable water, housing, medical facilities and other basic needs, Mr Karim said.
Furthermore, the flood-affe­cted people in Ghizer’s Khalti, Daen, Chaturkhand, and other areas also did not have access to roads and basic facilities.
For almost a month, the residents of remote Hisper Val­ley in Nagar had been maro­oned after the road was washed away by floods and landslides. Similarly, the Karako­ram Hig­hway near Hassanabad in Hun­za remained blocked for the third week and traffic was div­erted via an alternative route. The Haramosh and Bagrot valleys in Gilgit were also without road access, causing hardships.
A resident Shahzad Hussain told Dawn that the densely packed areas of Danyor, Sultanabad, and Mohammadabad in Gilgit did not have any water supply for more than a month, leading to a severe shortage of water. Locals said the residents had to purchase tankers daily, which the poor could not afford.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain, in a statement, said the National Highway Authority’s machinery had been mobilised to clear the Shandur road. He further said that a formal approval had also been obtained for the construction of an alternative route, and work was progressing rapidly. “Under the project, a bypass will be constructed and the road will be connected to the main highway through a bridge…” he added.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was expected to arrive in GB on Wednesday. According to a statement, a high-level meeting was chaired by GB Chief Secretary Abrara Ahmed Mirza to review the arrangements for the expected visit.
In a separate event at the PM’s House in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the three local shepherds of Gilgit-Baltistan, who saved hundreds of lives in a nearby village by issuing a timely alert about a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof). The PM met Wasyiat Khan, Insaar and Muhammad Khan, and presented them each a cheque worth Rs2.5 million as a reward for their humanitarian act.
