In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.
The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.</p><small>2025-10-30 04:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/6902a971cfd3e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952129/diagnosing-organised-crime' target='_blank'><strong>Diagnosing organised crime</strong></a><br><p>WHAT may appear as disparate events carried out by separate criminal syndicates are in fact manifestations of the overarching phenomenon of organised crime. For instance, the recent devastating floods in Swat, often attributed to climatic changes alone, were also driven by deforestation at the hands of the timber mafia. Similarly, the Lahore floods this year were caused not only by poor urban planning but also the illegal blocking of the city’s natural water courses by influential land grabbers.
In 2023, 350 Pakistanis drowned in a boat incident near Greece while being illegally smuggled into Europe. In another instance, the US INCS report of 2025 says that “mass quantities of drugs transit Pakistan’s maritime domain freely”, thanks to powerful transnational drug mafias. Widespread financial crimes in Pakistan, like money laundering and illicit financial flows, remain largely undiagnosed and undetected, eroding our economy, governance and national security. The US State Department estimates that around $10 billion is illegally funnelled out of Pakistan each year. This money is either obtained through corruption by public officials or are the proceeds of crime by powerful criminals, and sent abroad without detection.
As stated by Moisés Naím in Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy, “Organised crime should not be understood as isolated cartels but as pipelines through which illicit goods — drugs, arms, humans, illicit money — flow across borders and jurisdictions, often using the same routes and facilitators”.
 
 

In Pakistan, sadly, the state has consistently misdiagnosed them as isolated crimes rather than as interconnected criminal enterprises, facilitated by powerful state-embedded actors. Consequently, the pipelines of organised criminal networks stay largely intact, while law-enforcement agencies focus mostly on the arrest of their foot soldiers in sporadic raids. Targeting this wide spectrum of organised crime requires prioritisation according to the extent of harm caused, which requires an accurate diagnosis of the risk, based on data and evidence.
As the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime states, “Data is power in the fight against organised crime”. It follows that unless we plug the existing gaps in data collection and analyses, our diagnosis of organised crime in Pakistan shall continue to be inaccurate. The gaps in the diagnosis of organised crime in the country can be broadly divided into two categories — national and institutional.

Strong political will is needed to combat crime syndicates.

Since globally organised crime syndicates infiltrate government and political systems, strong political will is needed to combat them. In Pakistan, many cases have been reported in the media about how different types of mafias allegedly exert influence on official policymaking, like the sugar mafia, money laundering cartels etc. A case in point is Khanani & Kalia International, a Karachi-based, money-laundering syndicate, which was involved in worldwide transactions worth billions of dollars annually.
The arrest of its directors by FIA in 2008 and their subsequent acquittal by the court in 2011 indicates how the prosecution of powerful cartels works in Pakistan. There were reports of billions changing hands. Meanwhile, another director at KKI was arrested in the US in 2015 and convicted in 2017 for running a global money-laundering syndicate from Karachi worth billions of dollars annually. KKI was declared a transnational criminal organisation. Thus, the political will to address the challenge is uneven and depends on how politically powerful criminal networks are and what kind of organised crime they are involved in. Political will across the board to address all forms of organised crime is missing.
Meanwhile, the institutional response is fragmented. Institutions dealing with various forms of organised crime work in silos. Not only does this hinder the identification of cross-crime networks, it also results in two major gaps in diagnosing organised crime.
The first is the lack of a standardised national format for data maintenance by institutions dealing with different forms of organised crime, which impedes a uniform, holistic threat analysis across all institutions. Access to available data is limited, obstructing an objective and independent analysis of the issue.
Second, an essential aspect of diagnosing organised crime networks is accurate identification of corrupt public officials, or in the words of FATF, ‘politically exposed persons’ who may be facilitators of organised crime. The IMF is reported to have shared a draft with the Pakistan government in August 2025, pointing out that our system to identify politically exposed persons is “uneven”, implying that the more powerful you are, the less likely you are to be identified.
A multidimensional effort is needed to improve the diagnosis of organised crime in the country.
One, there is an urgent need to emphasise the gravity of the cross-sectoral impact of organised crime, which is missing in our national discourse. As per the UNODC, “harm caused by organised crime lies in its ability to simultaneously damage economies, weaken governance, fuel corruption, erode security and inflict severe social harm”. If left unchecked, it is likely to continue encroaching upon all segments of society, and as stated by Cornelis Roelofse, it can lead the country into “criminotocracy”, ie, “a system of governance where organised crime, governance and business, use the system for self-enrichment and manipulate the elections to remain in power”.
Two, the recently set-up Anti Money Laundering Authority should have adequate powers to meaningfully coordinate between different powerful stakeholders. For starters, it should draw up, in consultation with all relevant institutions, standardised formats of data maintenance to facilitate a holistic and comprehensive analysis of all forms of organised crimes in Pakistan, the harm these cause and their pipelines.
Similarly, the FATF’s 12th recommendation makes it mandatory for all relevant institutions in every country to improve systems to identify politically exposed persons. There is, thus, a need to get our act together before the FATF takes it up as a cause of concern.
The Global Organised Crime Index, 2023, rated Pakistan as a high-risk country with low resilience to deal with organised crime. That should ring alarm bells for course correction. It is for us to decide, whether we opt to identify and rein in these monstrous criminal syndicates, or allow ourselves to turn into a criminotocracy.

During the visit, PM She­­­hbaz also addressed the 9th edition of the Fut­ure Investment Initiative Conference besides holding meetings with heads of states and global business leaders.
 






In his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the two sides agreed to launch economic framework, seeking to strengthen the role of both public and private sectors in promoting joint ventures.
Under the framework, several strategic and high-impact initiatives are being explored in sectors including energy, industry, mining and information technology
At the confere­nce, PM Shehbaz called for cooper­ation to support countries like Pakistan that have been battered by climate catastrophes, emp­hasising that loans should not be the only option for recovery.

My advice to him is to keep them running. It is good that he has formed working groups among them, who will develop more detailed proposals. Once the proposals are developed, they should form a committee to review them. After that should come a consultative process to circulate the proposals for wider input from civil society, civil servants and the State Bank. Then he should do something truly unprecedented: submit them for parliamentary review.
Standing committees in the House and Senate should then call members of these working groups to come and brief them about the proposals. After that, the same committees should call for wider public input from analysts and commentators. Wise guys like yours truly here would be happy to oblige with detailed comment on the pros and cons of each proposal. And after that comes the implementation stage, for which there should be an interdepartmental task force drawn from retired civil servants, members of parliament, independent experts and business leaders. But before that, it will be important to draw up the terms of reference for this task force, for which there should be a separate committee.
 
 

Here is a bold statement, and in the spirit of Gen Z era engagements, please prove me wrong. Nothing good has ever come out of these proposals the business community has been bringing to the government over the past half century. Of all the lasting policy measures in place today, or any catalysing policy steps taken over the decades, show me one example of a measure that was proposed by the business community which became the basis of lasting economic dynamism.
You would be hard-pressed to think of a single example because there are none. Pakistan’s business community has literally grown up thinking that it is the government’s job to help them make a profit. They press this point by subtle attempts at blackmail. ‘We will be forced to shut our plants down’ they say sometimes. Or ‘we will take our investments to another country’.

Nothing good has ever come out of the proposals the business community has been bringing to the government.

Simple fact here is that not one of these gents is fit to run any business in any country beyond maybe glorified rent-a-car services or, yes, a pizza franchise. It’s only in Pakistan that they make outlandish profits for minimal effort, where they privatise the gains but socialise the costs of the incentives the government provides them with, and where they can credibly lobby a government to do more to help make their business profitable. If they threaten to close their plants, call their bluff. They don’t create jobs on the scale they like to think, in any case. Certainly not by any comparison to the informal sector or agriculture. If they threaten to take their investments to foreign shores, welcome them. Those who can already have. Those who have not, cannot. And they know it.
 
 

But there are some things the business community should understand, to the marrow of their bones. One, the era of cheap energy is over. With Pakistan’s gas fields in advanced stages of decline and the grid weighed down by large-scale defections and high-capacity payments, the only way to bring energy costs down is via subsidies, and there should be zero appetite for that today. Two, the era of cheap money is also over. Over the years, these same business leaders have grown accustomed to cheap, subsidised credit provided by the State Bank through various schemes. But those schemes have been abused heavily, especially in the time of the PTI government when they were used to pump money into real estate rackets and inflate prices of speculative assets like plot files under the specious argument of using housing and construction as an engine of growth.
It was in response to this that the IMF basically required the State Bank to surrender the power to run such schemes altogether. This was a good step and has been taken now. These schemes pump printed money into the economy, which is captured first and foremost by the billionaire elites, converted into dollars and remitted into their accounts abroad. Then comes the inflationary pressure they inevitably create, as the supply of rupees in the economy rapidly outpaces the availability of dollars, and the ensuing mismatch between foreign currency and domestic liquidity in the system forces an abrupt exchange rate devaluation. The resulting inflation hits the poor, who have seen little to none of the benefits from the period of growth trickle down to them.
The story is the same with the interest rate. The State Bank has wisely held rates steady in the last three announcements, and should continue to do so until external sector pressures subside reliably. Maybe, the State Bank should announce some sort of external sector comfort threshold that must be crossed before further rate cuts can be considered. These can include reserve import cover crossing the three-month bar, forward liabilities of the State Bank below $1bn, the export to import ratio remaining stable within a narrow, predefined corridor for at least two quarters. This will help mute some of the annoying babble around CPI inflation and interest rates.
 
 

The business community must understand that things are changing, and they need to keep pace with a changing world. Energy-intensive industries will find it difficult to survive in the new world, if they don’t make their own arrangements for energy going forward. Speculative enterprises like real estate should be allowed to gasp for air long enough till they internalise the virtues of actually adding value to make money. But under no circumstances should government take it upon itself to help revive industry fortunes. This is a great moment to communicate a long overdue message to the freeloaders. It is time to adapt or die. Let them do what business people do everywhere else: work and take risks.

According to Pakistani officials, the Afghan Taliban’s stubbornness is to blame for the failure. In particular, the Taliban’s refusal to give ironclad, verifiable guarantees that their soil will not be used against Pakistan by terrorist groups such as the TTP proved to be the biggest stumbling block towards an agreement.
From this point, we stand at a delicate juncture. The defence minister has used strong language, vowing to strike Afghanistan in case of further terrorist attacks, while also observing that Pakistan’s western neighbour had become a “congregation of international terrorism”. The UN, meanwhile, has observed that even through dialogue may have collapsed, it is hoped that there would be no fresh hostilities between the two states.
The sense of betrayal in Pakistan at the Taliban’s intransigence is understandable. Ever since the hard-line movement was formed in the mid-1990s, the Pakistani state has kept channels open with its leadership. This country was one of only three in the international community to recognise the earlier Taliban regime in Kabul. Many senior Taliban leaders are believed to have sought refuge in Pakistan after the US invasion in 2001. And after the Taliban successfully took Kabul in 2021, the then ISI chief was snapped in the Afghan capital having tea.
Even aside from the Taliban, Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees from the days of the Soviet invasion to the present. Therefore, the fact that the Taliban were unwilling to stop their TTP ‘guests’ and other terrorist groups from attacking Pakistan has justifiably struck a raw nerve in Islamabad.
 
 

As per the defence minister, an agreement was close at the Istanbul talks, but the Taliban negotiators could not get the nod from Kabul. He also added that Kabul was apparently following the Indian line. It is a fact that from being foes, New Delhi and the Taliban have suddenly warmed to each other; it would not be wrong to say that India is cultivating the Taliban to pressurise Pakistan.
At this stage, there are few good choices for Pakistan. The state should certainly keep its guard up, and infiltration attempts by terrorists based in Afghanistan must be thwarted. The defence of the country is non-negotiable. Yet, diplomatic efforts should also continue. It must be remembered that Afghanistan-based terrorism threatens the whole region, not just Pakistan.
Therefore, a regional approach to tackle the problem could bear results. The Taliban need Chinese and Russian investment and recognition, therefore together with these and other friendly states, Pakistan must continue diplomatic efforts until the Taliban disown their terrorist friends.

While Mr Khan is in jail, it is not clear who has been running his social media account. However, he has never disowned the messages shared from his X account.
“The continued delay in issuing notifications for Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as Leaders of the Opposition is deeply concerning,” the post said. “I demand that they be immediately notified as Leaders of the Opposition in the Senate and the National Assembly, respectively.”
 






The post also praised recent political rallies and urged followers to continue their efforts.

PTI leaders meet Fazl, seek his support for election to Senate seat

The post noted that the large turnouts at rallies in Charsadda, Khyber, and Karak demonstrate rising public awareness and a commitment to protecting rights. It also expressed appreciation to the organisers for their successful public outreach efforts.
The message instructed that PTI, in collaboration with the Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aaeen-i-Pakistan movement, “must now accelerate the struggle for true freedom.”
The former prime minister also addres­­sed internal party matters, clarifying communication protocols and leadership roles.
“To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, all instructions and correspondence concerning the party matters shall be conveyed solely through the Secretary General Salman Akram Raja,” the post stated.
It also affirmed his support for two party members, saying, “Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. … I have not issued any orders for their removal.”
Separately, Mr Khan’s party condemned Israel’s recent airstrikes in Gaza.
PTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram called on the international community, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, “to take immediate, decisive, and collective action to halt Israel’s aggression”.
The PTI also criticised the Adiala Jail administration for ignoring a court order regarding visitation rights for Khan. Mr Akram reported that despite clear instructions from the Islamabad High Court, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi and others were denied access.  He urged the IHC to take decisive action against those violating its orders and to restore Imran Khan’s right to meet his family, legal team, and political associates.
PTI meets JUI-F leader
Meanwhile, a PTI delegation visited the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Islamabad.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, said he proposed holding a national jirga to address security concerns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Maulana Fazlur Rehman assured support for the proposal,” Mr Qaiser said.
 






The PTI delegation also advocated for uniting opposition parties in Parliament and reached a consensus to nominate Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader. They also requested the JUI-F’s support for a vacant Senate seat from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.

In April, the premier had also Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology. He also stressed that Pakistan was “giving utmost importance to the space technology sector”, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.</p><small>2025-10-30 03:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952075/warming-wired-world-becomes-playground-for-the-rich' target='_blank'><strong>‘Warming, wired world’ becomes playground for the rich</strong></a><br><p> 

Source: Oxfam report

IN PAKISTAN, the wealthiest 10 per cent hold 42pc of the national income — lower than the average across major Asian economies, but still enough to create massive inequalities that make it impossible to build fair or sustainable societies.
This is one of the findings of an Oxfam report, highlighting uneven patterns of economic growth driven by widening wealth disparity, climate change and the digital divide.
Titled An Unequal Future: Asia’s Struggle for Justice in a Warming, Wired World, the report makes for grim reading: the richest 10pc capture 60-77pc of national income, while the poorest 50pc receive only 12-15pc; and the top 1pc own nearly half the wealth.
 






The report points out that in the past decade, the fortunes of Asian billionaires have more than doubled, whereas the poorest half of the population in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Korea, saw their share of income decline.

Oxfam report sees elite capture of wealth & income, climate crisis and digital divide as major challenges facing Asian nations

“The income share of the poorest 50pc has declined in almost all countries except Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam. The increase in these countries is also minimal, around 1pc, except in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myan­mar, the Philippines and Timor-Leste,” the report notes.
Dr Abid Aman Burki, who teaches poverty and inequality at Lahore University of Management Sciences, sees the report as a “bold attempt” at highlighting income and wealth disparities in the region.
“I think there is relevance for Pakistan,” notes Amitabh Behar, Executive Director at Oxfam International.
“Pakistan is among the countries in Asia hardest hit by floods and climate shocks, yet the richest continue to hoard wealth and dodge taxes, leaving ordinary people to face the worst of the destruction,” he told Dawn.
For the widening inequality in Pakistan, Dr Burki blames the current economic model. “It benefits the powerful elite with a tax system reliant on indirect taxes while disproportionately burdening low- and middle-income households.”
With public spending skewed towards debt repayment, defence, and subsidies for the elite, “there is very little left for health, education, and social protection” he added.
This assertion seems to be backed by Oxfam’s research: “In 2022, public investment in education amounted to 8pc of GDP in Bhutan and Kyrgyzstan, but less than 2pc of GDP in Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka,” the report states.
The report also details how indirect taxation disproportionately affects lower-income households. “In 2022, the tax-to-GDP ratio was at or above 30pc in Japan, Korea and New Zealand, compared to around 10pc in Laos and Pakistan.”
While countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have with high direct taxes, moderate value-added taxes and strong social spending capacities, countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam show continued reliance on indirect taxes, hence the burden still falls disproportionately on poorer households, it noted.
Climate, digital divide
However, economic reforms alone cannot close the widening gap between rich and poor; the climate crisis and the digital divide must also be addressed, as both deepen inequalities across the region, the report observes.
Nowhere is this more visible than in Asia, which the World Meterological Organisation terms the most “disaster-hit region”, recording over 1,800 events in the last decade, which claimed over 150,000 lives and affected over 1.2 billion.
Five of the world’s most vulnerable nations — Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — home to over 500 million people, bear the heaviest burden due to climate disasters.
To tackle and adapt to disasters, Asia requires around $1.11 trillion annually, but receives only $333bn, but much of this comes in the form of loans, the report notes ahead of the November COP30. “Wealthier nations continue to shirk their responsibility to pay for the climate damage they have caused in countries like Pakistan,” said Behar.
The report also emphasises the need to bridge the digital divide, which is largely defined by geography, affordability and social status. In the Asia-Pacific, 83pc of the urban population has access to the internet, compared to just 49pc in the rural areas.
“Across Asia, women, especially in South Asia, remain far less connected than men. Out of 885 million women in low- and middle-income countries not using mobile internet, 330 million live in South Asia,” the report states.
Pointing out the barriers such as affordability, low digital literacy, safety concerns, and unpaid care work, the report said these limit women’s access and exclude them from digital and tech-driven jobs.

US President Donald Trump

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has at least “25 times” cited claims that five to seven “brand new, beautiful” planes were shot down during the May conflict between Pakistan and India, according to Indian media tracking.
The actual number of losses remains disputed, but Trump’s remarks have helped validate Pakistan’s version of events and strengthened its diplomatic position.
 
 

Speaking at a regional meeting in South Korea on Wednesday, Trump again credited himself with preventing a full-scale war by threatening both India and Pakistan with 250 per cent tariffs — the highest he has mentioned for any country. “If you look at India and Pakistan … they were going at it,” he said. “Seven planes were shot down. They were really starting to go.”
Trump also praised Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, calling him a “great fighter”.

Asserts ‘brand new, beautiful’ planes shot down during conflict

“I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.”
A day earlier, addressing business leaders in Japan, he used almost identical language, describing how “two big nuclear powers” were heading towards war before his intervention. New Delhi continues to deny that any of its aircraft were lost and rejects Trump’s claim of mediation, insisting that the ceasefire was mutually agreed.
Trump’s version again contradicts India’s stance. He said he personally called Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan’s leaders to warn that Washington would halt trade and impose “massive tariffs” if the fighting continued.
Analysts see a broader shift in Washington’s tone. Michael Kugelman  of the Wilson Center noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We  see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan.”
Kugelman observed that while commercial interests drive White House  engagement, “the wider administration’s messaging has gone further.”  Rubio, he added, even described Pakistan as “an ally” — a rare term in  recent US policy.
The ripple effects of Trump’s statements are evident in the diplomatic sphere. US and Indian outlets reported that Prime Minister Modi chose to join the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur (Oct 26-28) virtually, apparently to avoid being publicly upstaged if Trump praised Pakistan in his presence. India’s opposition Congress Party called the move “a diplomatic retreat,” with Rahul Gandhi alleging Modi had skipped “another global stage out of fear of embarrassment.”
Pak-Afghan clashes
Trump has also spoken about the Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes, calling them “an easy one for me to solve” and praising Pakistan’s leadership as “great people.” His self-styled image as a “war-solver” projects US influence while keeping Pakistan central to regional diplomacy.
Yet, despite this apparent tilt towards Islamabad, Trump in Seoul signalled that a trade deal with India is imminent.
Trump’s rhetoric may have lent international weight to Pakistan’s account of the air war, but his economic priorities force him to seek a deal with India.

As tomato prices crashed to Rs200 per kg after rising to a record Rs600-700 per kg, onion prices are likely to remain under pressure in the coming days due to a demand-supply gap.
As soon as the prices of perishable and non-perishable commodities rise substantially, consumers restrict their purchases to their daily requirements rather than buying in bulk.
Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway President Haji Shahjehan said supplies of onion from the new Sindh crop have started on a low note, which may pick up pace by the third week of November. Still, till then, prices may remain on the higher side.
He claimed that a small quantity is also arriving from Iran. Still, prices in the neighbouring country are high, and reports are coming in about problems with the clearance of Iranian onions at the border.
Shahjehan said that the markets lack any supply from Afghanistan due to the closure of Pak-Afghan trade for the last two weeks after clashes at the border between the two countries.
“The wholesale markets have been facing a shortage of onions for the last few days due to thin arrivals from the Sindh crop and limited imports from Iran,” he said, adding that the wholesale price of the main staple food items of the kitchen has swelled to Rs6,000-6,500 per 40 kg from Rs3,000-3,500 a few days back.
Currently, exports of onions have also been suspended due to very high prices, he said.
As in past practice, daily item prices issued by the Commissioner Karachi never match market prices. The official retail rate of onions is Rs104 per kg, but it is available at Rs200-220 per kg.
Market traders said that onion prices have also risen in some cities of Punjab, with reports that a 105-kg bag is now available at Rs23,000. They added that the Sindh crop is also finding its way into the Punjab areas.
As per the Sensitive Price Index data ending Oct 2, the national average price of onion in various cities ranged from Rs55-140 per kg, rising to Rs65-160 per kg in the week ending Oct 23.Economic Survey FY25 suggests that onion production during FY25 surged by 16pc to 2.670 million tonnes from 2.304m tonnes in FY24.

• Dismisses claim about 400 to 600 deaths in Muridke protest
LAHORE: Apparently under pressure from some religious groups, the Punjab government on Wednesday announced handing over the administrative control of the mosques and seminaries erstwhile being run by proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to a group of moderate clerics.
The administration led by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier announced giving the administrative control of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries run by the TLP in the province to the Auqaf department.
Besides, CM Maryam ordered the release of TLP prisoners, who were fount innocent during the investigations.
At least eight people, including a policeman, were killed and over 1,600 injured in clashes between police and TLP supporters in Muridke earlier this month.
 
 

The Punjab police had arrested over 6,000 TLP activists so far following the violence, which was sparked by the outfit’s attempt to hold an anti-Israel demonstration outside the US embassy in Islamabad.
On Wednesday, a meeting of the Ittehad Bainul Muslimeen Committee was held with CM Maryam Nawaz in the chair.
Religious leaders from all schools of thought expressed full support for the Punjab government’s stance against the TLP and endorsed its efforts for maintaining peace.
 






In the meeting it was decided that the administration of the TLP-run mosques and seminaries would be handed over to the Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle Sunnat Pakistan led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
“Those who misuse religion for personal agendas are not serving the faith,” the CM noted.
“The mosques and seminaries are being handed over to Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman’s organisation for proper management,” she added.
Release of TLP supporters
The CM also ordered the immediate release of the TLP supporters, who were proven innocent, and instr­ucted officials to escort them home with “dignity”.
She dismissed the claim that 400 to 600 people were killed during the TLP protest in Muridke.
Referring to jailed former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, the Punjab CM said: “A person sitting in Adiala Jail tweets that 400 to 600 people died [in Muridke].”
She added that Mr Khan had been in jail for the last two years and still not stopped inciting sedition. “The lie of hundreds of people being killed was falsely spread. If it were true, where were the dead bodies?” she asked.
The CM further raised the question as to which hospitals provided medical treatment if thousands were injured.
“No videos of the injured and killed came to surface, but only those of raids and recoveries emerged,” she noted.
“When a police inspector was martyred, his funeral was held and everyone watched,” she continued, asking why were matters brought to such a tragic point that parents, wives, husbands and children were deprived of their loved ones.
The Punjab CM said everyone was surprised to see such a large number of weapons being recovered from TLP activists and supporters.
During police raids, she stated that modern weapons were recovered from TLP activists, including ones that even law enforcement agencies did not possess. “These arms were meant to be used against the state and the police.”
She denounced the harsh statements being made on social media about security personnel, adding that the agenda of those behind them was only to “defame religious and political parties”.
‘Miscreants creating divisions’
The CM observed that some people in religious groups were pious, guiding followers toward the truth. However, she asked: “who are those destroying property and taking innocent lives.”
She criticised the elements creating divisions among religious groups. She said certain miscreant groups were formed only to discredit and harm religious organisations.
“It is the state’s responsibility to protect the lives, property, and honour of citizens and to ensure daily life is not disrupted,” she added.
“The state was forced to act [against the TLP],” she said, continuing that while the world rejoiced over the Gaza ceasefire, some people in the country were calling for a march on Islamabad.
“Not once did these agitators [TLP] speak for Palestine. Instead, they incited violence against the police.”
She said using women as shields and hiding weapons in mosques was inhumane, referring to the TLP tactics.
The meeting was inf­o­rmed that all personnel deployed for the CM’s sec­urity were being screened following the crackdown against the TLP.
Besides, the security of the CM and some other members of her cabinet has been beefed up.
The CM announced a stipend of Rs25,000 per month for a prayer leader (imam) of each of the 65,000 mosques in the province.

“Because of other countries testing programmes, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said on Truth Social, ahead of the meeting with Xi in South Korea.
“Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years,” Trump noted.
 






President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
As Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
The United States last tested a nuclear weapon in 1992.
Tests provide evidence of what any new nuclear weapon will do — and whether older weapons still work.
Apart from providing technical data, such a test would be seen in Russia and China as a deliberate assertion of US strategic power.
The United States opened the nuclear era in July 1945 with the test of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and then dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to end World War Two.</p><small>2025-10-30 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300716216392194.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952099/no-confidence-motion-against-embattled-ajk-premier-ready' target='_blank'><strong>No-confidence motion against embattled AJK premier ready</strong></a><br><p>• PPP keeps cards close to chest as PML-N’s backing raises number of votes to 36
• ‘N’ vows to support the motion, not PPP’s candidate
ISLAMABAD: While a joint no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
Informed sources told Dawn that although only 14 signatures are required to submit a no-confidence motion, the number of signatories is much higher. Those who have signed include PML-N’s AJK chief Shah Ghulam Qadir, its parliamentary leader in AJK Legi­s­lative Assembly Raja Far­ooq Hai­der, and all six members of the forward bloc aligned with AJK Pr­e­sident Barrister Sultan Mehmood.
The PML-N has agreed to support the motion but, according to party sources, will not vote for the new prime minister from the PPP. The party’s ministers are expec­ted to resign after submission of the motion, and will sit on the opposition benches.
A day after a meeting at the Presidency in Islamabad decided that the PPP would form the government in AJK after unseating Anwarul Haq, 10 members of the forward bloc joined the PPP ranks, placing the party in a position to remove the AJK prime minister even without PML-N’s backing.
The development has raised the PPP’s strength from 17 to 27 members, matching the magic figure need­ed for a majority in the 53-member house.
Also, Muh­a­mmad Iqbal, a UK-based busi­nessman elected on a rese­rved seat for overseas Kashmiris, reportedly resigned.
With PML-N’s support, the total number of members ready to vote out Anwarul Haq rises to 36. A PPP source, however, claimed that the party already enjoyed the ‘open support’ of 37 members, with more in contact.
TV channels, citing party sources, reported that the PPP finalised Chaudhry Yasin, the president of PPP AJK, as its nominee for the office of prime minister, though he denied the media reports later in a post on X. He said the PPP leadership had not formally announced its nominee.
Sources said the formal announcement of the PPP nominee will be made after a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which could not take place on Wednesday.
In a related development, President Zardari chaired a meeting of senior party leaders, attended by PPP Chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Chaudhry Yaseen, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, and former AJK prime minister Sardar Yaqoob Khan.
The meeting focused on the political situation in Azad Kas­hmir, particularly the no-confidence motion against Anwa­rul Haq and the formation of a PPP government.
A meeting of PPP’s AJK parliamentary party will be held on Friday (tomorrow) at Zardari House. According to informed sources, the meeting will be chaired by PPP chairman, and the name of the next AJK PM will be announced afterwards.

Pakistan and Iran agreed in August that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Pakistan and Iran share close ties but persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained relations.
The interior minister is currently on a visit to Iran at a time of sustained tension with two of Pakistan’s neighbours, Iran and Afghanistan.
A press release issued today said he met President Pezeshkian, with the two discussing bilateral cooperation.
“Iran and Pakistan are partners in regional peace and stability,” the press release quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that he conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “message of goodwill” to President Pezeshkian.
The interior minister also briefed the Iranian president on matters related to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with Pezeshkian offering to play a “fraternal role” in easing the tensions between the two countries.
 






President Pezeshkian said Iran attached “special importance” to its relations with Pakistan and it could not forget the “immense support” from Islamabad.
Expressing satisfaction over bilateral relations, the Iranian president stressed the need for enhanced cooperation between the two countries to take advantage of vast opportunities.
Islamabad and Tehran’s renewed commitment to maintaining regional peace comes at a time when Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
Meetings with Iranian security officials
Naqvi also held separate meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Ardeshir Larijani and Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni during his visit to Tehran.
Naqvi and Larijani discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the field of security.
The meeting focused on counterterrorism, anti-narcotics efforts, and improved border management between the two, with both sides emphasising the need for closer collaboration and institutional linkages to address shared challenges.
“We are keen to expand cooperation with Iran, especially in the areas of security and counter-narcotics,” Naqvi said.
Secretary Larijani described the positive progress in bilateral relations as “encouraging and constructive”.
In a separate meeting, the two interior ministers discussed expanding mutual cooperation on internal security matters. Naqvi congratulated his Iranian counterpart on the successful hosting of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Ministerial Conference, terming it a “significant milestone with far-reaching implications” for member states.
“We wish to benefit from each other’s experiences on internal security matters,” Naqvi said, extending an invitation to Momeni to visit Pakistan.
Accepting the invitation, Momeni said he would soon travel to Islamabad and also thanked Naqvi for Pakistan’s participation in the ECO conference.
Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu, senior officials from Iran’s interior ministry and diplomatic representatives were also present during the meetings.</p><small>2025-10-30 02:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300751076e6a69d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952078/govt-steps-in-to-resolve-row-over-flow-of-wheat-seeds' target='_blank'><strong>Govt steps in to resolve row over flow of wheat seeds</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to resolve the wheat seed issue among the provinces, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research has called upon the provincial food departments to facilitate inter-provincial movement of wheat seeds on a priority basis.
Despite seed companies adhering to all agreed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the movement of wheat seeds between provinces has reportedly been hindered.
To address the issue, a meeting was held on the prime minister’s directives in Islamabad on Wednesday. 
During the meeting, chaired by National Food Security and Research Secretary Amir Muhyuddin, the provincial food departments clarified that all seed convoys with the necessary movement documentation were being allowed, and assured that instructions had been issued to food department authorities to facilitate the movement of wheat seeds as a priority.
A high-level supervisory committee, led by Mr Muhyuddin, has also been established to meet weekly on Wednesdays to monitor and review the progress of the inter-provincial wheat seed movement.
Furthermore, it was decided that officers from the Federal Seed Certi-fication and Research and Develop-ment will be deputed at check-posts on all inter-provincial routes connecting Punjab to other provinces. 
These officers will assist the food departments in the timely verification and movement of wheat seeds across provincial borders.
The meeting was attended by the secretaries of provincial agriculture and food departments, directors general of agriculture, and senior officials from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research.

Pakistan witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides engaging in recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Afghan Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.

Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
Elaborating more on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the information minister said: “The Afghan Taliban regime is completely responsible for the breakdown of the talks.
“When irrefutable evidence was given to them and their soil is being used against Pakistan’s sovereignty and for terrorist activities, and their people are involved with the TTP, then why are they resorting to evasion?”
The information minister added that Pakistan was thankful to Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating the talks, but said the Afghan Taliban had failed to agree on a unified agenda to stop terror attacks and take action against the groups responsible.
“How much more can we tolerate it?”
When asked about whether a ceasefire still existed after the failure of the talks, Tarar said: “Hope always remains for diplomatic efforts and it should always be there. Hope always remains in global issues that some diplomatic sources and matters will go towards peace, but rest assured: if their soil is used and we give them evidence of that, then Pakistan always has the right to respond for its self-defence.”
Questioned about the Taliban negotiators giving a verbal agreement but not a written undertaking to take action against the TTP, Tarar said that hesitating from signing the written agreement amounted to “hypocrisy” and asked if it was not evidence that “they want to support terrorists and are doing so”.
He questioned what more proof did the world need that the Afghan Taliban were not willing to stop terrorist activities and had malicious intent.
“Their word can’t be trusted, and their ill intent has come out openly. Why were they present in India when they conspired to attack Pakistan’s border?”
He said only “time will tell” how matters progressed from here on and border trade would remain shut for the time being due to the deadlock. “A final decision will be made in the next few days on what will be the future of all this.”
Conventional and proxy warfare advantage
Reiterating Pakistan’s military and diplomatic performance in the conflict against India, the information minister said about Afghanistan: “What do they think? Can they damage Pakistan through such activities? Absolutely not!”
He said there was no match between Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of conventional warfare, adding that “we will defeat them in proxy war[fare] too”.
When asked about the alleged threats made by the Taliban regime of striking Islamabad amid the current escalation, Tarar derided what he said was “propaganda warfare” and said Pakistan was not only effectively responding to it but would give a befitting response to it.
He maintained that said that the “unholy alliance” of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan would be snuffed out, while referring to the Afghan foreign minister’s remarks in India about occupied Kashmir during his visit to the country.
“Rest assured, if they attack through the border, or their soil is used, and we will present evidence of it before the world, it will be befittingly responded to. There will always be a response to attacking Pakistan or harming it; enough is enough. How long will they take Pakistan for granted?”
He added that, as per the UN Charter and international law, Pakistan had a right to respond if there was a direct or indirect attack on its territory and it could present evidence for it.
The minister questioned whether any other country would exhibit such restraint and give such leeway to the Afghan Taliban in the face of such attacks.
Tarar elaborated that the Pakistani state had a clear stance that Afghan soil should not be used for attacks on the former’s territory, nor should terrorists be facilitated by the latter; the movement of terrorists from the neighbouring country should also stop by respecting the integrity of international territorial borders and the interim Afghan authorities should take concrete action against terrorist elements.
The minister said there was a consensus in Pakistan that the above activities should stop. “Since the Afghan Taliban regime came to power, it has completely supported the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan join their formations.”
“Whenever there is an attack or terrorist activity in Pakistan, we show the whole nation and the world on television that Afghan nationals are oftentimes involved in them.”
He added that Pakistan had always desired peace and had played a constructive role, adding that the Taliban had violated the Doha agreement before as well and let down all parties to the deal.
“I think the Taliban regime does not have the support of the Afghan nation or the people. They want a war economy, but can’t sustain it.”</p><small>2025-10-29 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2923454665f2968.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952002/at-least-13-people-including-2-cops-injured-in-separate-attacks-across-balochistan-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 13 people, including 2 cops, injured in separate attacks across Balochistan: officials</strong></a><br><p>At least 13 people, including two police officials, were injured as two separate attacks were reported in Balochistan on Wednesday, according to local officials.
A grenade attack on a police mobile was reported along the national highway in the province’s Dera Murad Jamali area, which injured 13 people, including 2 officers.
According to police officials, unknown suspects attacked the vehicle while it was patrolling along the highway.
Immediately after the attack, police and law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and started an investigation into the incident, while security in the area was tightened.
Civil Hospital Dera Murad Jamali Medical Superintendent Dr Naseer Ahmed Imrani confirmed that 13 people, including two policemen, were injured in the attack and transported to the facility.
“A woman and two children are also among the injured, who are being provided medical assistance,” Imrani said. “The police have started investigating the incident.”
Meanwhile, Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ghulam Sarwar Bhiyo told local journalists that unidentified suspects fired four rockets at Jaffar Express on the railway track near Nutal.
“The attack was on the Jaffar Express, but fortunately, there was no loss of life,” he said. “FC and police personnel immediately retaliated, as a result of which the attackers fled the scene.”
Police officials said that the incident took place at Altafabad, where four rockets were fired, but the train safely reached Dera Murad Jamali railway station.
Security forces reached the area and established a cordon to sanitise the incident site.
“The Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail have been sent to Jacobabad after clearance from Dera Murad Jamali,” SSP Bhiyo said. “After the incident, security forces have further tightened security around the railway track.”</p><small>2025-10-29 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631173-pti-to-stand-with-pakistan-if-afghan-tensions-escalate-says-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to stand with Pakistan if Afghan tensions escalate, says Gohar</strong></a><br><p>

“During the conduct of [the] operation, seven Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the statement read.

Captain Noman was “a brave young medical officer who, besides performing the duties of medical care, also fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his five men,” the statement added.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as relentless counter terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
On Sunday, security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, according to the ISPR.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-10-29 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631158-captain-among-six-soldiers-martyred-seven-terrorists-killed-in-kps-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>Captain and 5 soldiers martyred, seven terrorists killed in KP's Kurram</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent weeks, which saw border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Responding to a question on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Gohar said that the PTI would stand with Pakistan in case hostilities with Afghanistan erupt once again, like they did during Islamabad’s brief war with India in May.
“We will stand with Pakistan like we did during the war with India, Afghanistan will not be any different,” he said. “But I will say that Pakistan has to live with its neighbours and it’s in its best interest to live peacefully.”
The PTI chairman quoted a saying in relation to the Afghan situation: “The one who has the most at stake must exhaust all avenues.”
“We have a lot at stake; if Afghanistan has a dialogue going, we need to try other avenues until we reach a consensus,” he stated. “As far as the Afghanistan situation is concerned, it is a serious one, because the Taliban do not completely control the country.”
“If the Afghan Taliban attacked Pakistan, obviously, the response would be like with India, but that does not mean that talking stops during war. Dialogue should happen by all means, but right now, especially, nations friendly to Pakistan should try and use their influence and talk to the Taliban.”
The PTI chairman also noted that Pakistan has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter, but that “Afghanistan has the same right”.
“As neighbours, we need to understand each other,” he said.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. They, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-10-29 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29211226b365a91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951992/hurricane-melissa-strongest-storm-ever-to-hit-jamaica-roars-onward-into-cuba' target='_blank'><strong>Hurricane Melissa, strongest storm ever to hit Jamaica, roars onward into Cuba</strong></a><br><p>Hurricane Melissa unleashed devastation in Jamaica as the strongest storm on record ever to hit the Caribbean island nation, and roared later on Wednesday into eastern Cuba, smashing the city of Santiago and flooding rural land.
A Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour when it barrelled into Jamaica, Melissa had been downgraded to a still dangerous Category 3 when it hit Cuba with sustained winds of 120mph, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
“Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and landslides, and damaging hurricane winds are ongoing this morning,” the centre said.
The historic storm blasted western Jamaica, demolishing homes, knocking down swathes of trees and washing out roadways. Authorities did not yet release details of fatalities but said they expected loss of life.
Eyewitness reports and videos on social media from Jamaica showed vehicles destroyed by flying debris, hotel doors blown off hinges and roofs scattered across neighborhoods. Video of the airport in Montego Bay showed inundated seating areas, broken glass and collapsed ceilings.
The storm was expected to weaken some as it crossed Cuba but would remain a dangerous hurricane upon reaching the Bahamas.
In eastern Cuba, around 735,000 people were evacuated from homes as the storm approached, authorities said. By mid-morning, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Cuba had already suffered extensive damage and warned residents against letting down their guard, urging them to remain sheltered.
‘Some loss of life expected,’ Jamaican leader says
In southwestern Jamaica, the parish of St Elizabeth was left “underwater”, an official said, with more than 500,000 residents without power.
“The reports that we have had so far would include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well, and damage to our road infrastructure,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said on CNN after the storm had passed.
The government had not yet received news of any confirmed deaths from the storm, but given the strength of the hurricane and the extent of the damage, “we are expecting that there would be some loss of life,” Holness said.
“It was so crazy. Like a freight train trying to come to a stop for eight hours,” said Journie Ealey, 34, a US tourist on vacation in Jamaica, reached by phone.
“I’ve never experienced anything like this before.”
Meteorologists at AccuWeather said Melissa ranked as the third most intense hurricane observed in the Caribbean, after Wilma in 2005 and Gilbert in 1988 — the last major storm to make landfall in Jamaica.
Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries.
Melissa’s winds subsided as the storm drifted past the mountains of Jamaica, lashing highland communities vulnerable to landslides and flooding.
“Our country has been ravaged by Hurricane Melissa but we will rebuild and we will do so even better than before,” Prime Minister Holness said earlier today.
US President Donald Trump said today he was prepared to assist Jamaica’s recovery. The State Department said it would send search-and-rescue teams.
In the Bahamas, next in line after Cuba in Melissa’s path to the northeast, the government ordered evacuations of residents in southern portions of that archipelago.
Farther to the east, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic had faced days of torrential downpours leading to at least four deaths, authorities there said.

Cuba hit

The storm’s centre, churning with violent wind gusts over 125mph and heavy rain, slammed early today into Guama, a rural, mountainous area 25 miles west of Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second most populous city.
The storm pressed on north-northeast across eastern Cuba. Authorities had shut down power to virtually all of eastern Cuba, evacuated vulnerable areas and had asked residents to shelter in place in the provincial capital Santiago, a city of 400,000 people.

Photos and videos posted earlier today on local media and eyewitness accounts in the city laid bare a chaotic scene, with downed power lines, shattered windows, trees and debris littering roadways.
In more rural areas to the west, videos showed torrents of brown rainwater rushing down roads through dark towns at the base of Cuba’s Sierra Maestra mountains. As the storm passed, winds remained too strong by mid-morning for residents to venture onto the streets.
Authorities reported widespread flooding of lowland areas earlier today from Santiago to Guantanamo, where upwards of 35 per cent of the population had been evacuated.

The timing could hardly be worse for the communist-run Caribbean island, already suffering from food, fuel, electricity and medicine shortages that have complicated life, prompting record-breaking emigration since 2021.
President Diaz-Canel said Cuba had mobilized 2,500 electric line workers who would begin recovery immediately following the storm’s passage across the island later today.
The hurricane was not expected to directly affect the capital Havana.</p><small>2025-10-29 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2918451355ff470.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951986/dig-traffics-vehicle-runs-afoul-of-karachis-new-e-challan-initiative-fined-rs10000' target='_blank'><strong>DIG Traffic’s vehicle runs afoul of Karachi’s new e-challan initiative, fined Rs10,000</strong></a><br><p>The vehicle of DIG Traffic Pir Mohammad Shah was issued an e-challan on Wednesday for violating traffic rules.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid the port city witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The e-ticket was issued to the DIG’s vehicle at the Lyari Interchange as the driver was not wearing a seatbelt.
“My driver was issued the e-challan for not wearing a seatbelt,” said the senior police official while speaking to Dawn.com.
He added that his driver was fined a sum of Rs10,000.
According to a press release by the Sindh police dated October 28, 1,535 challans have been issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for over speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving.
Earlier this month, Inspector General (IG) of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said the biggest problem in the metropolis is a lack of trained drivers, who are also responsible for tragic accidents.
Meanwhile, Additional IG of Karachi Javed Alam Odho said a faceless e-ticketing system would end abuse of powers by police and their negative attitude towards the public.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2919300576ed634.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951989/russia-tests-nuclear-capable-poseidon-super-torpedo-putin-says' target='_blank'><strong>Russia tests nuclear-capable Poseidon super torpedo, Putin says</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia had successfully tested the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
As United States President Donald Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon, named after the ancient Greek god of the sea, but it is essentially a nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone.
Putin, over tea and cakes at a hospital in Moscow with Russian soldiers wounded in the Ukraine war, said the test had taken place on Tuesday.
“For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,” Putin said.
“There is nothing like this,” he said, adding there was no way to intercept the Poseidon, which analysts believe has a range of 10,000 kilometres and can travel at about 185km per hour.
The Burevestnik and Poseidon tests are intended to send a clear message that Russia, in Putin’s words, will never bow to Western pressure over the war in Ukraine.
For Trump, who has called Russia a “paper tiger” for failing to swiftly subdue Ukraine, the message is that Russia remains a global military competitor, especially on nuclear weapons, and that Moscow’s overtures on nuclear arms control should be acted on.
Poseidon and the new nuclear arms race
The Poseidon is a new weapon that has appeared amid what Putin has cast as a global arms race — primarily between the United States, Russia and China — to modernise and develop their nuclear arsenals.
Poseidon, known in Nato as Kanyon, is 20 metres long, 1.8 metres in diameter and weighs 100 tonnes, according to Russian media.
Arms control experts say the weapon breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. They have estimated it would carry a two megaton warhead and perhaps is powered with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Putin said Poseidon’s power exceeded that of “even our most promising Sarmat intercontinental-range missile”, which is known as SS-X-29, or Satan II.
Since first announcing the Poseidon and Burevestnik in 2018, Putin has cast them as a response to US moves to build a missile defence shield after Washington in 2001 unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as well as to Nato’s eastern enlargement.
After Russia’s test of the Burevestnik, Trump said Putin should end the war in Ukraine instead of testing a nuclear-powered missile.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631129-tlp-seminaries-handed-over-to-mufti-munib-after-ban-says-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>TLP seminaries handed over to Mufti Muneeb after ban, says CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this month, SHC ordered the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to relocate the animal from Karachi Zoological Gardens to the Bear Sanctuary managed by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board within two days, marking an end to the years-long plight of the brown bear.
Today, Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah chaired a high-level meeting at the Sindh Secretariat to review the arrangements for Rano’s relocation, a statement by the secretary’s spokesperson Farhat Imtiaz Janwari said.
The meeting was attended by the Secretary Forest and Wildlife, Municipal Commissioner KMC, Conservator Sindh Wildlife Department, representatives from the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, and other wildlife experts.
The participants briefed the chief secretary on the progress made so far regarding the bear’s transfer, the statement added. The Sindh Wildlife Department informed the meeting that a specially designed iron cage meeting all safety standards has been prepared for Rano’s relocation.
“It was further informed that wildlife experts and trainers are currently engaged in daily training sessions to help Rano adjust comfortably to the new cage.”
Dr Aamir and Mrs Abida Raees from Karachi Zoo, wildlife rangers Abbas, Anees, and Sanna Raja from the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, and wildlife trainer Abid from the Sindh Wildlife Department are jointly supervising Rano’s behavioural training, per the statement.
According to experts, Rano has shown a positive response to the training. She has developed a friendly bond with wildlife ranger Sanna Raja and eagerly awaits her daily visits near the cage. Rano has also begun eating honey directly from Sanna’s hand, indicating strong trust and progress in her behavioral adaptation.
Shah directed that Rano must not be forcibly captured or sedated during the transfer process. He emphasised that the bear should voluntarily enter the transport cage through gradual and positive reinforcement training methods.
The chief secretary also instructed that the entire transfer process be recorded on video for documentation and transparency. He also directed the Sindh Wildlife Department to ensure that all arrangements in Islamabad are completed before Rano’s transfer.
As per the Sindh High Court’s order, Rano will first be shifted to Islamabad and then to her final sanctuary destination in Gilgit-Baltistan.
He further directed the Wildlife Department to forward a case to the Sindh Cabinet proposing a complete ban on the import of exotic (non-native) animals.
Shah observed that exotic animals suffer from depression and trauma due to the lack of a natural habitat and climatic compatibility in captivity.
He added that Pakistan is a party to several international conventions, including the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Chief Secretary Shah stressed that wildlife protection and ethical management of animals must be ensured in all zoos and wildlife habitats across Sindh in accordance with both local and international standards.

Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631130-jui-f-backs-ptis-nominee-achakzai-for-na-opposition-leader' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F backs PTI's nominee Achakzai for NA opposition leader</strong></a><br><p>

The report, written by Francesca Albanese and available with Dawn.com, notes that Israel’s actions were not carried out in isolation, but with the aid of “third states”.
“The genocide in Gaza was not committed in isolation, but as part of a system of global complicity,” the report stated.
“Rather than ensuring that Israel respects the basic human rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people, powerful third states — perpetuating colonial and racial-capitalist practices that should have long been consigned to history — have allowed violent practices to become an everyday reality.”
The report adds that foreign countries facilitating Israel and shielding it from accountability have enabled Tel Aviv to “embed its regime of settler-colonial apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territory”.

It adds that the Gaza genocide needs to be understood as an “internationally enabled crime”.
“Many states, primarily Western ones, have facilitated, legitimised and eventually normalised the genocidal campaign perpetrated by Israel,” the report read.
“By portraying Palestinian civilians as ‘human shields’ … and the broader onslaught in Gaza as a battle of civilisation against barbarism, they have reproduced the Israeli distortions of international law and colonial tropes, seeking to justify their own complicity in genocide.”
The report noted that successful measures implemented against Apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia and other colonial regimes “demonstrate that international law can be enforced to secure justice and self-determination”.
It added that the international community has the same legal and moral obligation to apply these and other measures against any state perpetrating apartheid.
“Their failure to hold Israel accountable for its long-standing international crimes — despite clear orders from international courts — exposes the flagrant double standards of the international community,” the report read.
It further noted that states have a range of options to prevent violations of international law, including the use of force, arms and trade embargoes, the denial of safe passage and prosecution and punishment.
Diplomatic and political actions
The UN report states that “influential” third countries’ support of Israel has enabled it to continue its attack on Palestine, through their adoption of Israeli narratives and Washington’s vetoing of UN Security Council resolutions against Tel Aviv.
The report added that Israel has not been expelled from international fora in sports and culture.

“States reverted to treating the situation as a humanitarian crisis to be managed, rather than resolved, by demanding that Israel end its unlawful occupation once and for all, providing further leeway to the assault on Gaza,” it stated.
 
 

It added that in February 2024, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands criticised Israel’s invasion of Rafah while simultaneously withdrawing funding from the UN Works and Relief Agency (UNRWA).
The UN also noted that sanctions on Israeli settlers and extremist organisations — including on far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir — created the “illusion of progress” and were isolated acts.
While Arab and Muslim states have long supported the Palestinian cause and produced some collective effort, “these actions have not been decisive, even amid Israeli aggression against six Arab states.”
Additionally, legal action has not borne any fruit, with only 13 states joining South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice and many Western nations “persistently” denying that a genocide took place in Gaza.
Military relations
The UN noted that while evidence of genocide has mounted, nations are still trading and sending arms to Israel.
“Israel is disproportionately dependent on weapons imports, with the proportion of their total trade more than double the OECD average, and over four times greater than that of the United States,” the report read, naming the US, Germany and Italy among the biggest suppliers.
“The third US–Israel MoU (memorandum of understanding), effective until 2028, guarantees $3.3 billion [per] year in FMF (foreign military financing) plus $500 million [per] year for missile defence.”

The report stated that since October 2023, the US has transferred 742 consignments of “arms and ammunition” and approved tens of billions in new weapon sales.
“Between October 2023 and October 2025, 26 States sent at least 10 consignments of “arms and ammunition” to Israel, the most frequent being China, including Taiwan, India, Italy, Austria, Spain, Czechia, Romania and France,” it read.
Though the UK did not directly supply arms, it did allow for a US supply line to Tel Aviv through its bases in Cyprus and flew 600 surveillance flights over Gaza during the past two years.
Weaponising aid
The report further stated that third countries were complicit in degrading the living conditions in Gaza, not only by facilitating Israel but also by failing to deliver adequate aid to Palestinians in the enclave.
“Since October 2023, Israel has turned existing restrictions into a full blockade. From October 2023 to January 2025, aid was limited to an average of 107 trucks per day — less than one-third of pre-2023 levels,” the report read, adding that by August this year, famine had been declared in the Gaza Strip.
“The genocidal campaign by Israel has deliberately sought to destroy the humanitarian system sustaining the occupied population,” it further stated.
“It (Israel) has done so through directly bombing UNRWA warehouses, food distribution sites, schools and clinics, killing more than 370 personnel, [launching] defamation campaigns against UNRWA and promoting ad hoc pseudo-humanitarian agencies.”
Instead of opposing Israel’s blockade, nations including Canada, the UK, Belgium, Denmark and Jordan airdropped aid packages in what the report calls an “expensive, inadequate and dangerous response”.
 
 

“Naval aid missions to Gaza, attempts by civil society groups to break the siege
have been unlawfully intercepted by Israel in international waters — amid silence and inaction by third states,” the report read.
Trade ties
Noting that Israel is heavily dependent on foreign trade for its economy, the report stated that no Western countries have halted trade ties in the face of Israeli violations of international law. In fact, trade between Israel and some countries grew.

Germany (+$836m)
Poland (+$237m)
Greece (+$186m)
Italy (+$117m)
Denmark (+$99m)
France (+$75m)
Serbia (+$56m)
The United Arab Emirates (+$237m)
Egypt (+$199m)
Jordan (+$41m)
Morocco (+$6m)

“Besides the suspension of the trade agreement with Israel, states must also suspend all trade with Israel in dual-use products, as the [European Union] did with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine,” the report urged. “
“Energy trade has often been subject to embargoes aimed at bringing countries in line with their international legal obligations: examples include apartheid South Africa and, currently, Russia and Iran,” it added. “In the case of Israel, only Colombia, which banned coal exports to Israel in 2024, has acted.”
The report stated in its conclusion: “Even as the genocidal violence became visible, states, mostly Western ones, have provided, and continue to provide, Israel with military, diplomatic, economic and ideological support, even as it weaponised famine and humanitarian aid.
“The horrors of the past two years are not an aberration, but the culmination of a long history of complicity.”
Through omissions and discourse in support of Israel, third countries “could and should be held liable for aiding, assisting or jointly participating in internationally wrongful acts”.
“At this critical juncture, it is imperative that third states immediately suspend and review all military, diplomatic and economic relations with Israel, as any such engagement could represent means to aid/assist/directly participate in unlawful acts, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”
The report recommended that states do the following:

Exert pressure for a complete and permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops
Take immediate steps to end the siege in Gaza, including deploying naval
and land convoys to ensure safe humanitarian access and mobile housing before winter
Support the re-opening of Gaza’s international airport and port to facilitate aid delivery
Recognise Palestinian self-determination and justice as essential to lasting peace and security
Suspend all military, trade and diplomatic relations with Israel
Investigate and prosecute all officials, corporates, and individuals involved in or facilitating genocide, incitement, crimes against humanity and war crimes and other grave breaches of international humanitarian law
Secure reparations, including full reconstruction and return
Cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice
Reaffirm and strengthen support to UNRWA and the UN system as a whole
Suspend Israel from the United Nations under Article 6 (a member of the United Nations who has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organisation by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council) of the UN Charter
Act under “Uniting for Peace”, in line with the General Assembly resolution

A day ago, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reached a severe peak of 422 but dropped to 341 today — still categorised as “hazardous” — keeping it at the top of the list of cities with the poorest air quality.
Behind the Punjab capital in the rankings were New Delhi with an AQI score of 232, Beijing at 222, Kinshasa and Kathmandu at 155 each, and Karachi at 140.
 


The Punjab government has taken notice of the situation and raised a high alert, including revising school timings across the province to begin at 8:35am.
In response to the crisis, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has also launched a large-scale anti-smog operation, deploying 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers, and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling.
Meanwhile, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, praised the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in handling the anti-smog operations, calling her hard work “a testament to the success of the vision of improving the environment”.
“In the coming years, Punjab will see improvements like Beijing,” she said.
She added that the improvements and measures taken to reduce smog had played a role in changing the mindset of farmers.
According to a report by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), this year’s environmental violations score was 294.
“Action is underway against plants causing air pollution,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29175900f315d74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951976/airspace-constraints-a-challenge-to-air-indias-on-time-performance-says-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Airspace constraints a challenge to Air India’s on-time performance, says CEO</strong></a><br><p>Air India’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Campbell Wilson acknowledged on Wednesday that airspace closures posed a challenge to the airline’s timely performance.
The airline has faced delayed jet deliveries and airspace closures due to geopolitical tensions, including bans imposed by Islamabad since April, when tensions with New Delhi intensified.
“Airspace constraints are a challenge to on-time performance,” CEO Wilson said at an Aviation India event in India’s capital city, speaking publicly for the first time since the June crash of the Boeing Dreamliner in Ahmedabad.
 
 

“We’re always looking at how we can keep improving,” CEO Wilson stated. “This year will be quite challenging from a business perspective … We’re also working with the investigators,” he added.
On April 24, in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect.
India and Pakistan fought their fiercest military conflict in decades in May, sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in India-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people. New Delhi, without evidence, alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe.
Since then, the two nuclear-armed neighbours have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines, with Islamabad most recently extending the ban till November 24.
 
 

According to a company letter seen by Reuters, Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if the ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year.
Other Indian airlines, including IndiGo, also face higher fuel costs and longer journey times as they reroute international flights. Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Airports Authority (PAA) also reported a shortfall of Rs4.1 billion in August, just over two months after closing its airspace to Indian-registered aircraft.
The delay in jet deliveries and airspace restrictions have weighed on Air India’s performance as it strives to recover from the plane crash of June 12 that killed 260 people.
The Tata Group-owned carrier has been facing intense scrutiny ever since the crash, from warning notices for running planes without checking emergency equipment to not changing engine parts in time and forging records, along with other lapses related to crew fatigue management.
India’s air accident investigating agency published an interim report earlier this year saying the plane’s fuel engine switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291258198858603.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951961/trump-again-praises-great-guy-pm-shehbaz-and-great-fighter-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Trump again praises ‘great guy’ PM Shehbaz and ‘great fighter’ COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May.
Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both Pakistan and India, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year.
“I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
 
 

“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too.
“And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said.
The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.”
He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.
“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’.
“And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.”
Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”.
 


“But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing?
“You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.”
He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.”
The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs, saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said.
Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29162313f6997a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951974/pakistan-receives-first-ever-us-crude-oil-shipment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan receives first-ever US crude oil shipment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday received its first-ever shipment of US crude with the cargo arriving at Cnergyico’s offshore terminal, marking a new chapter in Pak-US trade relations.
The cargo arrived aboard the Suezmax vessel MT Pegasus and docked at Cnergyico’s Single Point Mooring (SPM) port situated on the coast of Balochistan.
In August, it was reported that Cnergyico will import 1 million barrels of oil from Vitol this month.
“The arrival of Pakistan’s first-ever US crude oil cargo marks an important milestone for the country’s energy sector and for Cnergyico,” Vice Chairman of Cnergyico Pk Limited Usama Qureshi told Dawn.com.
“This first shipment will be followed by another in mid-November and a third in January 2026,” he stated, adding that collectively, “these three cargoes are expected to improve Pakistan’s trade balance with the United States by around $200 million”.
Qureshi said the SPM facility, the country’s only offshore crude handling terminal, can efficiently receive large vessels, reduce logistics costs, and enhance refinery operations.
“These imports not only diversify Pakistan’s crude supply but also strengthen bilateral trade ties and contribute to the country’s long-term energy security,” the vice chairman added.
In September, Cnergyico had ordered a second shipment of US crude after finding its debut purchase commercially viable, according to its vice chairman, paving the way for more imports.
In 2023, Cnergyico had imported the country’s first private-sector shipment of Russian crude oil, taking advantage of Moscow’s discounts on its oil exports.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29171916f222b18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951977/social-media-post-case-imaan-mazaris-husband-arrested-at-islamabad-court-for-intentionally-not-appearing' target='_blank'><strong>Social media post case: Imaan Mazari’s husband arrested at Islamabad court for ‘intentionally not appearing’</strong></a><br><p>Hadi Ali Chattha, husband of rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, was arrested from outside the courtroom in Islamabad on Wednesday in a case related to controversial social media posts.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued an arrest warrant for him at the hearing and adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow.
Mazari also posted on X about the arrest, saying: “My husband, Hadi Ali, has been arrested because Judge Majoka is insistent on committing misconduct. Hadi appeared in court today and despite his appearance the … judge ordered his arrest.”
Sharing a picture of the short order, she termed it “completely illegal” in a subsequent post, saying there was video evidence inside and outside the courtroom of Hadi being present.
“Today case was fixed for framing of charge and prosecution evidence. Hadi Ali Chattha accused has intentionally not appeared in court. Hence, his bail bonds are forfeited and non-bailable warrant of arrest be issued against him” for tomorrow, the short order said.
In a video shared by journalist Matiullah Jan on X, Chattha claimed there had been three hearings in the case since morning and he was present in the courtroom but the judge had refused to come out from his chambers while conveying the message that he would issue an arrest warrant for him.
“I am saying to him that I am present so why will you issue my arrest warrant. If there is any proceeding then tell me I am present in court. This is misconduct that he is refusing to come out from his chambers and is saying from inside: ‘No, you go away and I want to issue your arrest warrant.’”
Chattha said it would be a “great injustice” if lawyers were tried in courts, proceedings were not conducted and then judges said that they would issue arrest warrants for them no matter what.
 






Journalist Saqib Bashir said the entire situation was “surprising” since arrest warrants were issued to ensure appearance in court and were normally cancelled when those undergoing trial appeared in court.
 






Journalist Baqi Sajjad termed the arrest a “continuation of the persecution of the human rights activists”.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The case has been registered under Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29170749a1e68b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951957/asif-warns-afghanistan-of-deep-strikes-if-pakistan-attacked-from-its-soil' target='_blank'><strong>Asif warns Afghanistan of ‘deep strikes’ if Pakistan attacked from its soil</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the Taliban regime on Wednesday that Islamabad would strike “deep into Afghanistan” if Afghan soil was used to launch terror attacks on Pakistan.
In a pre-dawn announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the latest round of talks between the two countries in Turkiye, which aimed to address cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil, “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
“We will conduct strikes, we definitely will,” Asif told reporters at Parliament House, when asked about the options available for Pakistan in case of cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
“If their territory is used and they violate our territory, then, if we need to go deep into Afghanistan to retaliate, we surely will,” he added.
Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”.
Speaking about the recently collapsed talks today, Asif said, “Kabul was not sincere at any level for any arrangement. On the directives of India and by becoming its proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan wants to leverage its position over Pakistan through Afghanistan.”
He added, “The entire leadership of Kabul is playing in the hands of India.”
 


The minister noted that working groups from both Pakistan and Afghanistan were present in Istanbul. He added that despite an agreement being close, Kabul prevented it.
“Again and again, whenever something was finalised and an agreement was drafted — this happened three or four times I think — they contacted Kabul and a ‘no’ came from Kabul, because of which we could not reach an agreement with them,” Asif detailed.
He further said that if those in Kabul had chosen the path of confrontation, then “so be it”.
Speaking further about the persistent issues during the recent dialogue, Asif said the other side acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
 
 

“They were agreeing with everything but were not ready to give in writing,” the defence minister said.
Responding to a query, Asif stated that including TTP in the talks was not discussed. “Even if they had said so, it would have been a total refusal from us,” he asserted.
The minister went on to say that even the mediators — Qatar and Turkiye — now knew of the “futoor (infirmity)” in Kabul’s intentions. “We made this attempt with full sincerity so that Pakistan and Afghanistan can live in peace as good neighbours.
“But if they have handed over their reins to Delhi, then this will be difficult,” he added.
“It can only be prayed, [but] there’s no medicine,” Asif quipped, when asked about the likelihood of better sense prevailing.
‘Afghanistan does not fulfil definition of state’
The minister said the legitimate status of the Afghan Taliban as the government was not clear and did not have international recognition, except for a few countries.
“That government does not have its writ in the entire Afghanistan. Afghanistan is practically shattered into pieces, where one or the other influential terrorist group … there is a congregation of international terrorism there,” Asif said.
 
 

The defence minister said Afghanistan neither “fulfils the definition of a state” nor did the interim administration consider it so. “They are the ones who are involved in the killings, and they are taking financial benefits by being the rulers.”
Asked whether the Afghan Taliban were taking their country towards a similar situation as the United States’ military operation in Tora Bora in December 2001, Asif said, “It is definitely a possibility.”
‘Test our resolve and capabilities at your own peril’
Asif’s latest remarks come hours after he issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them to test Islamabad’s resolve at their
“own peril and doom” if they wished to do so.
“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X.
 






The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”.
“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.”
 
 

Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”.
“Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said.
In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country.
 
 

“As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented.
He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”.
“If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!”
UN expresses concern over talk failure
In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”.
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN.
“Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported.
From border skirmishes to talk failure
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.
