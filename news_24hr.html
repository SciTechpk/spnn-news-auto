Delhi suspended its participation in the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe.
Despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing to a ceasefire this month following the worst fighting between them in decades, the accord remains “in abeyance” by India.
According to data provided by Wapda today, the inflow of water at Chenab River at Marala Headworks was 98,200 cusecs on May 29, before dropping to 44,800 cusecs yesterday. The inflows plunged further to 7,200 cusecs today, with no water discharged.
 
 

Overall, a reduction of 91,000 cusecs in the inflow of water at Chenab River at Marala Headworks was recorded in the last two days.
The Flood Forecasting Division of the Pakistan Meteorological Department categorised the flow at Marala Barrage as “normal” and showed a falling trend.
Chenab River water flows had also been impacted when India virtually stopped water discharges from it into Pakistan without prior notice on May 5, just before the two countries’ military escalation.
A senior official of the Punjab irrigation department had said at the time that India was using Pakistan’s water “to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin”.
He noted that Marala Headworks was located 76 kilometres away from Salal Dam, one of India’s three hydropower projects in the Chenab basin.
According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system as its canals, including the Upper Chenab and Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.
Rejecting the weaponisation of water by India, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday warned that Pakistan would not allow Delhi to cross the red line by holding the IWT in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.
 
 

His statement came after India’s PM Narendra Modi threatened that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India had “rights”.
Even after the ceasefire, Modi had ordered officials to expedite the planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers — three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters (PCIW) has finalised a detailed report on the IWT violations by India, including the construction of three hydroelectric projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31181638d644d16.jpg?r=181658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914527/iran-steps-up-production-of-highly-enriched-uranium-iaea' target='_blank'><strong>Iran steps up production of highly enriched uranium: IAEA</strong></a><br><p>Iran has stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium in recent months, according to a confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seen by AFP on Saturday.
Tensions between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief fell apart.
The IAEA’s latest report comes as Tehran pursues delicate negotiations with the United States on its nuclear programme.
It said in its quarterly report that it is of “serious concern” that Iran has an estimated amount of 408.6 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 per cent as of May 17, up by 133.8kg since the last report in February.
Uranium enriched to up to 60pc fissile purity is close to the roughly 90pc level needed for atomic weapons. According to the IAEA, Tehran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to 60pc.
Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon.
In a separate in-depth report, the IAEA criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran over its scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear programme.
“While Iran continues to cooperate with the agency on matters of routine safeguards implementation, in a number of respects […] its cooperation with the agency has been less than satisfactory,” the report said.
It specifically notes Tehran’s lack of progress in explaining nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
“In particular, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the agency’s questions and has sanitised locations as listed in this report, which has impeded agency verification activities.”
Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a landmark 2015 deal with Tehran during his first term as president. The deal had exchanged sanctions relief for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31180819b9b3e8e.jpg?r=180947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914526/trump-says-chinese-students-in-us-will-be-ok' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Chinese students in US will ‘be ok’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump told reporters late on Friday he wanted to assure Chinese international students in the country that they would be fine amid his administration’s crackdown on academia.
Trump’s administration this week said it would specifically target permissions for Chinese students, in its latest broadside against US higher education. But when asked on Friday what message he would send to Chinese college students in the country, Trump insisted: “They’re going to be ok. It’s going to work out fine.
“We just want to check out the individual students we have. And that’s true with all colleges,” he told reporters.
The softer tone comes after a judge on Thursday extended a temporary block on Trump’s bid to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio vowed on Wednesday to “aggressively” revoke visas to students from China. Rubio has already revoked thousands of visas, largely over students’ involvement in activism critical of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but also over minor traffic violations and other infractions.
The Trump administration has been in an ongoing showdown with academia, and Harvard in particular, demanding that it provide a list of students that the government is interested in, something the prestigious university has declined to do.
“I don’t know why Harvard’s not giving us the list. There’s something going on because Harvard is not giving us a list,” Trump said on Friday.
“They ought to give us a list and get themselves out of trouble,” he insisted, suggesting that “they don’t want to give the list because they have names on there that supposedly are quite bad.”
At graduation ceremonies this week, Harvard University president Alan Garber received a one-minute standing ovation when he called for universities to stand “firm” in the war the Trump administration has waged against students and schools.
“We want people that can love our country and take care of our country and cherish our country,” Trump said on Friday.
International students on average make up just under six per cent of the US university population — far below Britain, the second top destination for international students, where the figure is 25pc.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31164132d813129.jpg?r=164142' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914520/punjab-ctd-foils-major-plot-by-arresting-34-terrorists-of-banned-organisations' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD foils ‘major plot’ by arresting 34 terrorists of banned organisations</strong></a><br><p>Punjab’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Saturday said it foiled a “major terror plot” by arresting 34 terrorists of banned organisations during 415 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) across the province.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.
The law enforcement agency said in a statement, “Two dangerous terrorists [were] arrested in Lahore along with explosives, both of whom are affiliated with Fitna al Khawarij.”
Fitna Al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement quoted a CTD spokesperson as saying, “Punjab CTD conducted 415 IBOs in different districts of the province to effectively deal with any untoward incident of terrorism, in which 420 suspects were questioned and 34 terrorists were arrested along with weapons, explosives and other prohibited materials.”
The terrorists were identified as Muhammad Ashfaq, Ismail Khan, Naseerullah, Irshad, Saqib, Shoaib, Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Adeel, Muhammad Ki Naam, Muhammad Suleman, Hamza Tariq, Qazi Khan and Sakhi Zaman.
The spokesperson also said that the terrorists were affiliated with Fitna al Khawarij and other organisations, adding that the IBOs took place in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Jhelum, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Narowal, Jhelum, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, Bukhara, Kasur and Nankana Sahib.
 
 

The CTD recovered 5,841 grams of explosives, 19 detonators, 51 feet of safety fuse wire, one grenade, pamphlets, cash and mobile phones.
The statement further said that the terrorists had planned to target important buildings in different cities, adding that 23 cases had been registered against the terrorists, and further investigation was underway.
It added that 5,045 combing operations were conducted in May with the cooperation of local police and security agencies, 209,518 people were checked, 604 suspects were arrested, 561 FIRs were registered and 456 recoveries were made.
The statement said that Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and no stone will be left unturned in its efforts to bring terrorists and anti-state elements behind bars”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
Last month, the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31172853243d768.jpg?r=175851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-is-flying-high-militarily-economically' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says Pakistan is ‘flying high’ militarily, economically</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Pakistan was “flying high” off the back of its victory in a military conflict against India and economic progress made since he took office as prime minister.
The comments, made during an address at the Quetta Command and Staff College, followed a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

India, however, is still weaponising the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water distribution deal between the two countries — saying that it will no longer abide by the treaty, placing the agreement in “abeyance”.
In his address today, PM Shehbaz congratulated the military personnel in attendance on their counter-operations against India. He said these operations had left New Delhi “completely baffled and shell-shocked”.
“We won a war against an enemy, which in the eyes of our detractors was unthinkable, but we have converted this unthinkable into a reality, and I think that is our finest hour in history,” he stated. “Pakistan at this point in time is flying high.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the conflict with India was not only victorious, but illustrated that the threats Pakistan faces are no longer restricted to conventional battlefields.
“They [threats] are multifaceted, ranging from kinetic warfare to cyber attacks, economic coercion, disinformation campaigns and hybrid threats that challenge both our borders and ideological frontiers,” he elaborated.
“The recent Indian aggression … was not only countered successfully, but we turned the tables on those who tried to establish a new normal,” he added. “Indian leaders had no option but to concoct a patently false explanation for their losses. Operation Bunyanum Marsoos destroyed the enemy’s defences and shattered the myth of their military might.”
The PM highlighted that Pakistan “established a new norm” in its relations with India, warning that the country will never let its neighbour “behave in an arrogant and haughty manner”. He also reiterated that Pakistan would not allow India to continue weaponising the IWT, calling it a “red line”.
“We need to convert this moment into something this nation has been longing for — that Pakistan’s progress … would not only be witnessed [and] enjoyed by [the people], but that the world at large would respect Pakistan’s hard work,” he added.
‘Sacrifice, blood and sweat’
Noting Pakistan’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister said that the country “faces major challenges” on the economic front.
Highlighting economic difficulties during his tenure in 2022, Shehbaz said, “International banks were refusing our letters of credit for vital imports like energy … linked to Pakistan’s wellbeing”, and the country faced the threat of international lending agencies walking away.
“As a result of that meeting in Paris in July 2023, we were able to sign a standby agreement with the IMF, which averted an impending economic meltdown,” the PM said.
He added that upon assuming office in 2024, his administration “wasted no time” implementing major reforms and making “cast-iron guarantees to lending agencies”.
“We would not shy away from undertaking difficult, tough, but very relevant, deep-rooted changes in our system,” he said. “We undertook those very difficult decisions and we were able to calm those fears of our lending partners. Today, we are witnessing the fruits of those sacrifices made by the common man in Pakistan.”
According to the PM, inflation plummeted from 38 per cent to 0.3pc, while interest rates were halved from 22.5pc in 2022 to 11pc.
“Our rupee stands stable [and] forex reserves have crossed over a billion dollars,” he said.
“These achievements, significant as they are, represent only the beginning of a very arduous, difficult, thorny journey towards progress and prosperity. On the way, we will meet huge challenges like mountains, rivers — we will have to surmount them [and] cross those rivers through unwavering commitment to our nation and our people, and that will require sacrifices, sweat and blood,” he emphasised.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3116452302c47d3.jpg?r=164925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914521/pakistan-says-india-violating-global-human-rights-by-deliberate-incitement-against-its-own-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says India violating global human rights by ‘deliberate incitement’ against its own Muslims</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday said India was violating its international human rights obligations by its “deliberate incitement” against Muslims in its own territory.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
Responding to media queries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement: “The targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory actions, and state complicity is a matter of serious concern for the international community.
“At a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates international human rights obligations and vitiates the prospects for communal harmony, and regional stability,” it added.
Pakistan expressed “grave concern over the alarming rise in Islamophobic incidents across India” and called upon its government to “uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith”.
 






Earlier this month, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8.
These affected at least 316 individuals, “physically or otherwise”, noting that the actual number was likely higher.
The incidents comprised 84 hate speeches, 64 acts of intimidation, 42 harassment incidents, 39 assaults, 19 acts of vandalism, 14 threats, seven verbal abuses and three murders.
 






The APCR further said that 106 of the 184 hate crimes were linked to the Pahalgam attack. The highest number of them was recorded in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.
“The nature of hate crimes indicates a nationally resonant atmosphere of hostility and not local anomalies,” the civil rights group noted.
One such incident was the vandalism of Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad by the right-wing workers of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
According to Al Jazeera, incendiary music tracks labelling Indian Muslims as “traitors” and advocating their boycott were being circulated widely. Al Jazeera found at least 20 songs that “carried and amplified such Islamophobic themes”.
Besides intensifying a crackdown on alleged links to Pakistan, India has also made arrests over critical comments.
 
 

Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor with the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University, was arrested on May 18 in a case related to his comments on the military briefings during the India-Pakistan flare-up.
Days later, Mahmudabad was granted bail by India’s top court, which also ordered the formation of a special police team to probe his comments.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607081-adc-hidayatullah-buledi-laid-to-rest-after-deadly-surab-attack' target='_blank'><strong>ADC Hidayatullah Buledi laid to rest after deadly Surab attack</strong></a><br><p>

India’s Sachin Yadav took silver with an 85.16m and Japan’s Yuta Sakiyama took home bronze with an 83.75m throw. Both athletes threw a personal best.
After leading the field in the first few throws, Sri Lanka’s Rumesh Tharanga Pathirage was bumped off the podium to finish fourth with an 83.27m throw.
India’s Yash Vir Singh finished fifth with an 82.57m personal best throw.
China’s Hu Haoran threw a season best 80.93m to finish sixth, while Sri Lanka’s Sumedha Jagath Ranasinghe Ranasinghe Mudiyanselage finsihed seventh with a 79.81m throw.
Pakistan’s Muhammad Yasir finished eighth with a 75.39m throw.

Speaking to Dawn.com after the final, Nadeem’s coach Salman Butt said: “It was a good performance, especially since this was his first competition of the season.
“If there had been one day of rest between [yesterday’s] heats and finals, he would have had more recovery and a better throw. But this is a good start,” he said.
Nadeem’s triumph marks the first time Pakistan has won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in 50 years.
Nadeem, who holds the Olympic record after throwing a monstrous 92.97m at Paris 2024, narrowly missed breaking the championship record of 86.72m.
Nadeem had a slow start in the competition, throwing 75.64m and 76.80m on his first and second attempts before bagging top spot with an 85.57m throw on his third attempt. He then threw 83.99m and 83.44m before flexing his muscles and throwing a commanding 86.40m to win gold in his sixth and final attempt in true Arshad Nadeem fashion.
All eyes were on Nadeem as he stepped up to the field for his first throw and the audience waved Pakistani flags.
‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ was blaring in the stadium as the crowd anticipated a massive throw from the javelin superstar, who is competing internationally for the first time since last year’s Paris Olympics.
Nadeem was in a state of prostation after winning gold, as his become characteristic of the 28-year-old who added another feather to his cap.
 
 

He bagged gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, followed by a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.
In yesterday’s heats, Nadeem threw an impressive 86.34m throw on his first and only attempt to cruise into today’s final. Yasir qualified for the final with a 76.07m throw in the heats.
After he punched his ticket to the final, Nadeem took to Instagram to say: “As always I would need your support and prayers.”
Nadeem’s gold is Pakistan’s first and only medal at the championship.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s fastest female sprinter Tameem Khan finished 17th in the Women’s 100m heats with a 12.14.
Meanwhile, top sprinter Shajar Abbas ran a 47.17 in the Men’s 400m heats, and a 47.38 in the semi-finals, where he finished 12th. Compatriot Abdul Mueed ran a 50.10 in the heats and finished 27th.
Ahead of the championship, Nadeem was awarded Best Male Athlete of the Year by Asian Athletics.
 






Felicitations pour in
President Asif Ali Zardari said Nadeem “has once again brought glory to Pakistan” as he congratulated the 28-year-old on his win.
“He had excellent performance throughout the championship, including in the final,” the president was quoted as saying in a post on X by PPP.
“I congratulate the entire nation on this victory and pray for his success in the future.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Nadeem’s “hard work, dedication and outstanding success are a worthy example for young athletes.
“The glory of the crescent flag has increased after Arshad’s outstanding performance,” he said on X.
 






The cricket fraternity was quick to congratulate Nadeem, with T20 Vice Captain Shadab Khan calling his win “another proud moment for the nation.”
“What a throw, what a champ! Arshad Nadeem you beauty!” he said on X.
 






Former T20 captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi also felicitated Nadeem on their Instagram Stories.
 


 


The Pakistan Cricket Board posted on X, saying: “Gold for Pakistan!”

Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a Dawn report, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
 






While speaking to Bloomberg at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Chauhan said, “I think what is important is not the jets being downed but why the jets were shot down.”
In response to a query by the show’s host, he confirmed that Indian fighter jets were shot down during the recent escalation between the two countries.
He emphasised that the reasons why the Indian jets were shot down and what the Indian forces did after that were more important.
General Chauhan also claimed that the four-day conflict never came close to the point of nuclear war.
American and French officials also confirmed that Pakistan shot down an Indian jet using fighter aircraft it acquired from China, CNN and Reuters reported earlier in the month.
CNN cited a senior US official saying, as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India’s air strikes inside Pakistan.
A high-ranking French intelligence official also told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.

Earlier in the month, American newspaper The Washington Post also verified visual evidence that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
The paper based its findings on analyses by former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball, Etienne Marcuz, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research and an anonymous French air power expert.
“In a review of more than a dozen images and videos posted online in the aftermath of the strikes, The Post verified debris consistent with at least two French-made fighter jets flown by the Indian Air Force — a Rafale and a Mirage 2000,” The Post reported.
After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p><small>2025-05-31 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/311404418cb3b1f.png?r=144440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914506/kabul-also-levels-up-its-pakistan-diplomat-to-ambassador-as-ties-see-normalisation' target='_blank'><strong>Kabul also levels up its Pakistan diplomat to ambassador as ties see ‘normalisation’</strong></a><br><p>Hours after Pakistan decided to enhance ties with Afghanistan yesterday, the Afghan foreign ministry welcomed the decision and announced upgrading the status of its chargé d’affaires in Islamabad to ambassador.
Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys earlier this month — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations due to terrorism concerns repeatedly voiced by Islamabad.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan welcomes the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its diplomatic mission in Kabul to that of an ambassador,” the Afghan foreign ministry said on its X account late on Friday.
“In reciprocity, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will elevate the status of its mission in Islamabad from chargé d’affaires to ambassador,” the ministry added.
 






Zakir Jalaly, an Afghan foreign ministry official, wrote on X that the current chargé d’affaires in Islamabad, Sardar Ahmad Shakeeb, will assume responsibilities as the country’s ambassador to Pakistan.
 






Kabul’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is due to visit Pakistan “in the coming days”, ministry spokesman Zia Ahmad Takal told AFP.
Following Pakistan’s decision from yesterday, its chargé d’affaires Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani will be levelled up to an ambassador.
This elevation in diplomatic representation between the two countries paves the way for enhanced bilateral cooperation in multiple domains.
Pakistan and Afghanistan made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two nations “expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible”.
Wang, who hosted an informal Afghanistan-China-Pakistan trilateral meeting in Beijing, had welcomed that development and said China would continue to provide assistance for the improvement of Pak-Afghan relations.
 
 

Pakistani experts have acknowledged the role of China, which pressed Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to normalise relations.
“China, as a bridge builder, is playing a historic role in bringing together Muslim countries,” Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute, told Dawn.com today.
“They presided over the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023, then brought 14 Palestinian factions together in Beijing in 2024, and now they have helped in normalising ties between Islamabad and Kabul,” detailed Mushahid, who has served as the chairman of the Senate foreign affairs and defence committees.
He recalled that at the tripartite meeting hosted by FM Wang, all three countries agreed to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to include Afghanistan as well. Then they politely prodded both sides to restore their level of representation to ambassador level, he added.
The senator termed the decision as a good sign that both Pakistan and Afghanistan were willing, ready and able to move forward on the path of normalisation with China’s “excellent” facilitation.
 
 

“China as a South Asian power also has the highest stakes for peace, security and stability in the region,” Mushahid highlighted.
Afghan experts also view the decision as very important for engagement in the current environment in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Dr Ubaidullah Burhani, an American academic writer of Afghan origin and a researcher in political strategy, noted that the levelling up of diplomatic ties represented a significant political development, adding it arrives belatedly within a context marked by complex geopolitical rivalries.
“It is imperative, however, that both sides seize this opportunity to engage in direct, constructive dialogue — independent of regional pressures — in order to lay the groundwork for policies that build mutual trust and deliver concrete outcomes,” Dr Burhani told Dawn.com.
The international affairs specialist stressed that priority should be given to advancing cooperation in critical areas such as trade, healthcare, and education, to ensure that diplomatic gestures are matched by practical steps that serve the interests of both nations and their people.
 
 

Ambassador Nizamani, who joined the Foreign Service exactly three decades ago, was sent as charge d’affaires in November 2022, months after Ambassador Mansoor Khan completed his tenure.
According to a profile of Ambassador Nizamani shared by the embassy with Dawn.com, he has served as the deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC from November 2019 to February 2021.
Other roles he has been posted at include deputy high commissioner at the High Commission for Pakistan in New Delhi, political counsellor at the High Commission for Pakistan in Dhaka as well as at Pakistan’s embassy in Berlin, and vice consul at the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jeddah.
In Islamabad, Nizamani has served as the director for the US, as well as director general for Europe and South Asia.</p><small>2025-05-31 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31145216f02413c.jpg?r=145239' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914510/punjab-govt-to-impose-section-144-in-province-during-eid-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt to impose section 144 in province during Eid holidays</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government on Saturday said that Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will be in place to prevent disturbance of public peace and danger to human life from June 5 to June 11.
A notification issued by the provincial government today said that it was reported that during Eidul Azha, random people burned the heads and feet of sacrificial animals which emitted unhealthy smoke and unpleasant smell.
“Members of the public throw entrails of sacrificial animals on roadside and drains, which causes smell/insanitary conditions and blockage of sewerage system,” the notification added.
It continued that people in different areas swim in the “canals, ponds, lakes, riverbanks and distributaries during Eid holidays”, placing their lives at risk.
“Cattle sellers illegally establish sale points for sale/purchase of sacrificial animals within populated areas of districts, which causes hindrance in smooth conduct of traffic and also spread of different diseases,” it read.
“The said activities are not only injurious to public health and safety, but also cause nuisance and resentment among the general public [and] are likely to cause disturbance in public peace and tranquility.”
The notification said there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent disturbance of public peace and danger to human life within the territorial limits of the province of Punjab.
Therefore, the government prohibited the following actions June 5 to 11 across the province: “Burning of the head and feet of sacrificial animals in public places; swimming/bathing/boating in rivers/lakes/dams; throwing offal/ entrails of sacrificial animal on manhole/ drainage/canals etc; sale/purchase of sacrificial animals at any place other than notified cattle markets and display of arms and ammunition.”
A spokesperson for the Punjab home department clarified that no banned organisation will be allowed to collect hides of sacrificial animal on Eidul Azha.
“Only organisations registered with the Punjab Charity Commission will be able to collect the hides of sacrificial animals.”</p><small>2025-05-31 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607049-top-indian-defence-official-admits-india-lost-jets-in-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Top Indian defence official admits India lost jets in Pakistan conflict</strong></a><br><p>

The National Assembly Standing Committee on Federal Education met at the education ministry with Dr Azimuddin Zahid Lakhvi in the chair. The members said there were alleged reports that four question papers had been leaked and were available on various WhatsApp groups.
They said reports alleged that the question papers were available for sale a day before the exam and were sold for dollars.
MNA from Faisalabad Mohammad Ali Sarfraz, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, informed the committee about the leaked papers. He said leaking of papers had put future of shining students at risk.
 
 

“My own daughter, who has excellent academic record, was crying after one of the papers as some other students got the question paper in advance and 100pc same questions appeared in the exam,” he said and showed a video of alleged leaked papers to the members.
The committee said the alleged reports about leak of four question papers had raised serious concerns among students and parents as they pay heavy exam fees to Cambridge.
Executive Director (ED) Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah said IBCC had received reports about the leak of question papers. He, however, said that Cambridge did not provide required information to IBCC, which was a regulatory body. He said every year around 150000 students appear in Cambridge exams and they deserve transparency.
He requested the committee to form a subcommittee to look into the issue as parents and students were showing their grave concerns.
Dr Mallah said that in the past Cambridge used to conduct exams through British Council only, but now they are also conducting exams through schools. He said IBCC was not in favour of conducting exams through schools.
The committee stated that the incident had raised questions on the integrity of the examination process of Cambridge University in Pakistan. The committee urged Cambridge University and relevant authorities to address these critical concerns promptly. The committee directed Cambridge to ensure that remaining papers are not leaked.
After showing grave concerns, the committee formed a subcommittee to discuss the matter and draw recommendations and submit a report in 30 days.
The subcommittee will ascertain under whose authority and legal framework Cambridge University operates in Pakistan. The committee demanded transparency regarding the regulatory oversight governing these examinations to ensure accountability. Additionally, Cambridge University must disclose what remedial measures it had taken in the past to address similar leaks and whether those measures were effective in preventing future breaches.
 
 

Most urgently, the committee stated that steps must be taken to protect affected students from bearing the consequences of the negligence. The committee called for possible solutions including re-conducting the compromised papers under enhanced security, adjusting grading methodologies to account for the irregularity and offering supplementary examination opportunities. Cambridge University must also provide a clear and binding commitment to strengthen examination security, investigate the leak thoroughly, and implement stringent measures to prevent recurrence.
The incident highlighted the need to strengthen Pakistan’s own examination boards. The government and educational authorities should invest in modernising assessment systems, pursue international accreditation for local boards and establish robust mechanisms to restore public trust and reduce dependency on foreign examination systems.
Earlier, Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education Uzma Yousuf avoided a direct question about paper leakage. She did not share details that how many question papers had been leaked, but said Cambridge had been conducting exams in 160 countries and it had a secured system.
When she was pressed by the committee members to focus only on the paper leak issue, she said since exams were ongoing, the members will be provided with complete details after June 16. “Why we are assuming that [leaking happened].”
Later, she provided a copy of a press release to Dawn, stating: “We are aware of alleged leaks of specific exam questions and we fully understand the concerns and frustration these claims cause students and their families. We would like to re-assure you that our legal compliance teams urgently investigate all evidence thoroughly so that results are fair.”
It also claimed, “We have seen a significant amount of fake information, including scam circulation on social media…we don’t comment on specific allegations during exams series, we don’t want to distract students at an important time.”

They added that Waqar Ahmad, head of a private school in Sur Kamar locality, subjected a student of grade 5, Khiyal Mat Khan, to corporal punishment during the morning assembly, leaving him critically injured. The student later succumbed to his injuries in hospital.
The police said that the school head used a stick to beat the student on head, neck, face and back, which caused his death. They said that they had arrested the accused when the matter was brought to their notice.
 
 

Residents of Jamrud demanded exemplary punishment for the accused, and also an end to corporal punishment in educational institutions.
Meanwhile, Afghan drivers complained of police torture of one of their colleagues in Shah Kas area on Friday.
They alleged that traffic police manhandled an Afghan driver right in front of the police training centre in Shah Kas without him committing any traffic violation or provocation.

Almost six months since he last represented Pakistan, the flamboyant opener sparkled with a career-best 74 as hosts trounced a hapless Bangladesh by 57 runs in the second Twenty20 International at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday to seal the three-match series with a game to spare.
With Sahibzada in full flow — having returned to the national team fold after an impressive show in the Pakistan Super League — and Hasan Nawaz making a quickfire 51 not out, Pakistan amassed 201-6 after electing to bat.
The bowlers then came to the fore as Bangladesh lost their way after a bright start; spinner Abrar Ahmed being the destroyer-in-chief with 3-19 as Pakistan bundled them out for 144 with only Tanzim Hasan Sakib (50) offering some late resistance.
 


It was Pakistan’s first series victory since they beat Zimbabwe in December last year. Sahibzada’s poor return in that series had seen him fall out of national reckoning, but on his return, he set the tone for Pakistan.
Sahibzada, who replaced Fakhar Zaman in the playing eleven, had a nervy start, almost getting caught on the third ball he faced but on the next ball he faced, he slammed Mehidy Hasan Miraz for four through extra cover.
Fellow opener Saim Ayub, though, departed early; the left-hander losing his footing as he was sent back by Sahibzada while looking for a third run on the last ball of the second over that was completed by spinner Shamim Hossain after pacer Shoriful Islam got injured.
The dismissal didn’t stop Sahibzada though and Mehidy was slog-swept for consecutive sixes in the next over. Hasan Mahmud was then hit for back-to-back fours down the ground with the incoming Mohammad Haris coming to the party with a thumping six over midwicket on the fifth ball of the fourth over.
Sahibzada was proving unstoppable; a six over mid-wicket followed over Tanzim. Haris was also in the mood; hitting Hasan for three successive boundaries — thorugh fine leg, midwicket and cover — as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 67-1.
Lady luck was smiling on Pakistan too with Farhan seeing an edge fly past the keeper for four off Shamim. Sahibzada got to his maiden T20 International half-century off 29 deliveries in the ninth over before Haris ended a 13-ball boundary drought with a scoop for six off Shamim.
Sahibzada then got another life — Mehdiy dropping him — and celebrated it by depositing Rishad Hossain for back-to-back sixes; first down the ground and the next over square leg with Pakistan reaching the midway point of their innings at 107-1.
Haris scooped Tanzim for four on the first ball of the 11th over but was gone by the end of it, finding Rishad at backward point after making 41 off 27. Sahibzada soon followed, caught behind off Rishad having hit the previous ball for the sixth six of his 41-ball stay as Pakistan slipped from 115-1 to 121-3.
Skipper Salman Ali Agha, though, kept the momentum going, dispatching the first two balls he faced for fours. Hasan also didn’t take long to get going; a six over extra cover off Mehidy followed by a four and six off Rishad.
Salman got his third boundary off Hasan but was gone next ball after a 12-ball 19 as he was trapped lbw trying to sweep, offering Bangladesh a chance to rein in Pakistan.
Mehidy then gave away just six runs in the 17th over and Tanzim seemed primed to do the same in the next until Hasan slashed him away for four off the last ball. Big hits were getting scarcer and Shadab Khan fell attempting one off Hasan Mahmud (2-47) on the last ball of the 19th.
But Hasan freed his arms in the last over, pulling Tanzim (2-36) for six and then raising his half-century of just 25 balls before Faheem Ashraf fell on the final ball of the innings.
Tanzid Hasan (33) got Bangladesh’s chase off to a flier, hitting back-to-back fours off spinner Salman and a six over extra cover; the first over yielding 17. Two more boundaries came off the next over by Hasan Ali.
Pervaiz Hossain Emon at the other end was having the best view of Tanzid’s charge as Faheem Ashraf was slashed for four to begin the third over. But Pervaiz perished in an attempt to emulate his partner, getting caught at long-on as he tried to go big off Haris Rauf and Tanzid was sent back by Faheem soon after, snapped by Abrar at short-fine leg.
Bangladesh were coming off the rails and Hasan sent back Litton Das — Haris diving at mid-on to take a sharp catch, before Abrar (3-19) had Towhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali lbw  off consecutive balls in the seventh over; the visitors losing five wickets in the space of 18 deliveries.
Shamim denied Abrar a hat-trick by cutting him away for four but he fell in the spinner’s next over, pouched in the deep by Saim. Leg-spinner Shadab then had Rishad caught behind as Pakistan continued to chip away.
Mehidy, who had come in at number five, kept Pakistan at bay and Tanzim smashed consecutive sixes off Haris to help his side cross the 100-run mark. But the writing was on the wall for them when Khushdil sent back Mehidy (23).
Tanzim, though, kept delaying the inevitable — depositing Khushdil for consecutive sixes. He then hit Saim for his fifth maximum on the first ball of the 19th over, completing his century three balls later before getting caught behind to bring down the curtains for his side.

The agreement between the two airlines has come under public criticism in India after Turkiye came out in support for Pakistan during the recent conflict.
The pact has also been opposed by IndiGo’s rival Air India, which has lobbied the Indian government to end the deal, citing business impact and security concerns.
 
 

India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had denied IndiGo’s request for a six-month extension and approved only three months, citing passenger convenience. The lease was due to expire on Saturday.
The regulator said IndiGo gave an undertaking that it will terminate the lease with state-owned Turkish Airlines by Aug 31 and will not seek a further extension.

The airline has previously defended the Turkish partnership, saying it offers multiple benefits to Indian travellers and boosts aviation growth and jobs.
Turkiye’s support for Pakistan during the recent conflict has sparked a boycott of Turkish products, including chocolates, coffee and clothing, in India.
IndiGo has had a codeshare partnership with Turkish Airlines since 2018 and has used that to connect travellers from India to a growing number of destinations in Europe and the US in the last few years, making Istanbul an important hub for India’s largest airline.
Since 2023, Turkish Airlines has leased two IndiGo two Boeing 777 aircraft with pilots and some crew. The aircraft currently operates on the Delhi-Istanbul and Mumbai-Istanbul routes, allowing IndiGo to carry more passengers, compared with the narrow bodies it operated previously.
IndiGo has been leasing aircraft to tide over aircraft delivery delays and expand internationally. The airline expects its first Airbus A350 by early 2027 and the long-range A321XLR this financial year.
In the absence of the leased 777s, IndiGo could go back to operating narrowbody aircraft on the two routes, or it could use widebody aircraft it has leased from Norse Atlantic Airways. It could also deploy the XLRs once they are delivered, analysts have said.
The regulator’s decision to give a limited extension comes after the Indian government earlier this month revoked the security clearance of Turkish ground handling service firm Celebi, citing national security, prompting a lawsuit from the Indian arm of the Turkish firm.

Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.
Pakistan’s formal negotiations with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.
“Pakistan representatives are coming in next week,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.
“And India, as you know, we’re very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn’t have any interest in making a deal with either (Pakistan and India) if they were going to be at war with each other. I went that and I let them know,” the US president stressed.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between Pakistan and India over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.
India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.
Reuters reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.
The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.
Trump again claims role in Pakistan-India ceasefire
President Donald Trump also reaffirmed his claim of having brokered the May 2025 Pakistan-India ceasefire — a statement that continues to irk New Delhi but is quietly welcomed in Islamabad.
Speaking at a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump said his intervention “stopped India and Pakistan from fighting”, adding that the conflict could have “turned out into a nuclear disaster”.
“We talk trade and we said we can’t trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons,” he said. “They’re great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed and that all stopped.”
This marks the fifth time President Trump has publicly cited his role in halting the conflict. He underscored America’s power to both wage and prevent wars, stating, “Ultimately, we can fight better than anybody,” but added, “we’re stopping others from fighting also.”
He also expressed gratitude to the leaders of both South Asian nations, as well as his own diplomatic team. “I want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also,” he said.
 


A Pakistani delegation, led by PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, will arrive in New York on Sunday. It is expected to meet UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the current president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The delegation will also address a joint session of OIC envoys during its two-day stay in New York.
The group will travel to Washington on June 3, where it hopes to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior US officials. The visit also includes meetings with congressional lawmakers, policy experts from major think tanks, and US media representatives.
While Pakistani officials have been cautious in public, they privately acknowledge that President Trump played a significant role in defusing the recent conflict. In contrast, India has repeatedly rejected the notion of outside involvement, claiming that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan and achieved without US mediation.
Curiously, Islamabad denies making such a request and instead credits President Trump — creating an unusual diplomatic convergence between Pakistani officials and the current US president.
Trump’s latest comments are seen in Islamabad as a timely morale booster for the visiting delegation. Pakistani diplomats say they not only endorse his claim but would welcome a broader US role in South Asia, particularly in resolving the Kashmir dispute. Trump had earlier underscored the need to resolve this issue, calling it a “festering wound” that must be addressed to ensure lasting peace in the region.
President Trump’s remarks were part of a broader narrative positioning his second term as one focused on restoring global stability. “When I left, we had no wars, we had no problems. We defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation,” he said. “And when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place.”
Listing current global crises — including the war in Ukraine, the Israeli invasion of Gaza, and tensions in the Indo-Pacific — President Trump cited South Asia as another region where US leadership has made a difference. “And now we have something where we’re really healing a lot of that,” he said, casting himself as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.
His assertion of having averted a “nuclear disaster” is likely to prompt strong reactions in diplomatic circles, particularly in New Delhi, which has consistently rejected third-party involvement in its disputes with Pakistan.
Yet, the timing of his remarks is significant. The Pakistani delegation’s visit to Washington aims to focus on trade, regional security, and reshaping US-Pakistan ties amid shifting global alliances and domestic political transitions. President Trump’s comments may complicate the diplomatic tone — or, for Islamabad, provide an opening to highlight its international relevance and US engagement.
Analysts say even if the president’s role in the ceasefire is exaggerated, the fact that hostilities ceased suggests that diplomatic pressure — including from Washington — was a factor. Given President Trump’s preference for direct engagement and bold claims, his involvement cannot be ruled out.
For Pakistan, the ceasefire remains a rare instance where a US president publicly acknowledged playing a role in reducing South Asian tensions — something successive governments in Islamabad have long sought.
As one Pakistani official noted privately: “It doesn’t matter who claims the credit, as long as the firing stops.”
Meanwhile, Christine Fair, a US scholar once seen as aligned with pro-Indian perspectives, challenged New Delhi’s narrative of success in the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
“Indians who fail to see the victories that Pakistan snatched from the latest skirmish will fail to understand just why India has not and will not deter Pakistan,” she wrote in a post on X.</p><small>2025-05-31 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3111240315dbfbb.png?r=113058' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914438/budget-2025-26-govt-asked-to-avoid-surprises-in-budget' target='_blank'><strong>BUDGET 2025-26: Govt asked to avoid surprises in budget</strong></a><br><p> 

Ehsan Malik, Pakistan Business Council CEO

KARACHI: Business leaders have advised the government to avoid surprises in the upcoming federal budget by proposing significant relief for the salaried class, including a reduction in the general sales tax (GST) and the phasing out of the super tax.
In addition to balancing the external account and managing the fiscal deficit, Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik stated that there is now an urgent need to augment defence spending through higher export earnings.
The PBC’s budget proposals aimed to fiscally incentivise the rapid growth of exports and the indigenisation of inputs. Given the constraints on the fiscal account, the council sought a gradual reduction in corporate and super taxes, as well as the withdrawal of multiple taxation on inter-corporate dividends.
Relief was requested for salaried employees, as was a reduction in GST, which at 18pc incentivised evasion. He emphasised that a higher tax-to-GDP ratio should be the result of business growth, not the outcome of further taxes on those already taxed.

Leaders demand tax relief for salaried class and industries

 

M. Abdul Aleem, OICCI Secretary General

Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Chief Executive/Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem has recommended a fresh approach in this year’s budget, urging bold measures to expand the tax net by ensuring proper tax collection from the trade, services, and agriculture sectors.
He also proposed tax relief for the salaried class and the rationalisation of industry taxes in line with regional norms.
He sought a gradual reduction in corporate and sales tax rates, along with the phasing out of the super tax in three years.
“We urge the government not to throw in surprises and engage all the stakeholders for tax reforms along with ensuring policy consistency,” Aleem added.
 

Saquib Fayyaz Magoon, FPCCI SVP

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said the focus should be on boosting exports as the government has been claiming it would not go to International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the future after the completion of the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility.
“In this scenario, the government should frame policies to develop the export sector,” he added.
He urged the government to avoid “new taxes” on export-oriented sectors as they would increase production costs and make goods uncompetitive globally.
 

Jawed Bilwani, KCCI President

Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani stressed the need to enhance industrial competitiveness, promote exports, broaden the tax base, and eliminate structural inefficiencies in the economic framework.
The past fiscal year has seen significant macroeconomic improvements, offering an opportunity to implement targeted policy interventions that can drive sustained economic growth.
“We strongly advocate for a broad-based, transparent, and predictable tax framework that expands the tax net, removes distortions, and fosters a fairer distribution of the tax burden,” he said, adding that rationalising aggressive tax regimes, eliminating inefficiencies, and simplifying tax procedures will be essential in ensuring a pro-growth fiscal environment.
Mr Bilwani noted that the SME sector, which serves as a backbone of economic activity and employment, continues to struggle due to limited access to finance and an unsupportive regulatory framework.
 

Ahmed Azeem Alvi, Site Association President

Site Association of Industry (SAI) President Ahmed Azeem Alvi urged the government to prioritise industrial growth and exports in the budget for FY26 by widening the tax base, capping business income tax at 25pc, abolishing the Super Tax, and reversing recent controversial amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance.
He called for a harmonised GST system, faster refunds, gradual reduction of sales tax to 15pc, and abolition of the additional sales tax to reduce informality.
He demanded an end to Fata/Pata tax exemptions, overhauling welfare schemes, and adopting digitalisation, and a one-window operation. Ahmed also urged the restoration of zero-rated status for export sectors and essential goods.

• Regrets govt opted to burden military courts instead of improving judicial system
ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on Friday issued a 36-page dissenting note challenging the majority verdict that upheld the trial of civilians in military courts and raising questions about the use of military courts for civilian cases.
“Nowhere in the world, courts martial try terrorism-related cases,” said Justice Mandokhail, a member of the seven-judge constitutional bench, in the dissenting note.
Justice Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, in a minority judgement on May 7, set aside intra-court appeals against the Oct 23, 2023, five-judge judgement that had declared the military trials of civilians illegal.
While brushing aside the perception that civil courts had failed to tackle the menace of terrorism and courts martial were the only solution to the problem, Justice Mandokhail explained that courts martial did not have jurisdiction to deal with cases of terrorism or other criminal matters.
 
 

He regretted criticism of criminal courts was unfounded and was not supported by any reliable data. It was true that the conviction rate by the ordinary criminal courts was low, but it did not mean that the courts did not have the will to do proper justice, he added.
Justice Mandokhail also expressed regrets that the elected governments instead of addressing the politically motivated and frivolous cases, improving the system of investigation, establishing a mechanism of collecting truthful witnesses and protecting them, providing workable atmosphere, protection to the judges and improving the judicial system, expressed no confidence in criminal courts by opting to burden the courts martial with such a huge responsibility.
According to him, Pakistan Army Act relates to members of the armed forces to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline, as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and, therefore, does not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.
On the right to appeal against decisions of the court martial, Justice Mandokhail observed there was always a possibility of mistakes or errors in court rulings. He noted that an appeal to a higher, independent and impartial forum was a universally recognised tool to scrutinise the decision of fora below so as to eliminate the slightest instance of miscarriage of justice.
Appeal being a continuation of trial was, therefore, an important substantial ingredient of the fundamental principles of fair trial and due process, without which, the fundamental rights of individuals would be compromised.
Justice Mandokhail said the military officers presiding over the courts martial may be good at disposing military-related matters, but had no judicial expertise and experience to deal with criminal cases. Courts martial cannot be considered on a par with the judicial officers who are not only law graduates but also with the only function to deliver justice and having vast judicial experience at their credit, he emphasised.
 
 

The judicial officers were independent, impartial and without the influence, command and control of the executive, he noted.
He regretted that the federal and provincial governments, instead of attending to the causes of terrorism and taking preventive measures, were trying to achieve their goal through courts martial, which was “not a correct approach”.
Justice Mandokhail was of the opinion that expecting ordinary criminal courts to convict persons without evidence and material, connecting them with the offence, would amount to violating the principle of natural justice, fair trial and due process.
He noted that the Pakistan Army Act was a disciplinary statute related to members of the armed forces as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and therefore, did not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.
However, on the effect of taking away fundamental rights in civilians’ trial, Justice Mandokhail observed that these rights were inalienable, unless expressly taken away by the Constitution. Taking away, abridging or denying the fundamental rights, had serious consequences, he observed, as it could undermine the fundamental principle of democracy, compromise the well-being of a citizen, and amount to giving a licence to the executive to abuse, torture, illegally detain and treat the citizens inhumanely.
Besides, the denial of fundamental rights would have a negative impact upon the economic treaties and domestic and foreign investments, Justice Mandokhail observed, adding that violating or denying the fundamental rights could weaken the rule of law.
 
 

Article 245 prescribed the functions of the armed forces, limited to defending the state from external aggression and internal threat, while Article 175(3) mandated that the judiciary shall be separated from the executive, he wrote.
As the function of the armed forces did not include the prosecution of general criminal offences committed by civilians, exercising powers beyond the defined scope was without jurisdiction, he noted.
According to him, indulging courts martial in adjudication of criminal cases of a general nature in respect of the general public would subject them to strong criticism in either case of conviction or acquittal, which will result in loss of trust and confidence in the army, whose function is only to defend and protect the country.

Among the posthumous recipients of Dag Hammarskjold medals were Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsanullah Khan from Pakistan, both of whom served with the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who presided over the ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber at UN Headquarters, presented the awards for the fallen peacekeepers. These were received by the ambassadors of their respective countries.
Awards for civilians were received on behalf of their families by UN Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support Atul Khare.
 







57 peacekeepers from 32 countries also honoured

Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, accompanied by the Mission’s Military Adviser Col Umar Shafique, accepted the awards for his countrymen.
Mr Guterres also presented the 2024 Military Gender Advocate of the Year award to Squadron Leader Sharon Mwinsote Syme from Ghana, and the UN Woman Police Officer of the Year award to Superintendent Zainab Gbla of Sierra Leone. Both also serve with UNISFA.
 






 






This year’s theme focused on the future of peacekeeping. Mr Guterres said, “peacekeepers face increasingly complex situations in an increasingly complex world,” citing growing polarisation, terrorism, misinformation, climate change, and transnational crime.
“Now more than ever, the world needs the United Nations and the United Nations needs peacekeeping that is fully equipped for today’s realities and tomorrow’s challenges,” he said.
The secretary-general stressed that “it is essential that peacekeepers have what they need to do their jobs,” calling it “the shared responsibility of the United Nations and Member States”.
UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said, “Our personnel are our most important capability. The sacrifices made by our peacekeepers call for more than remembrance; they demand action.”
He added, “The future of peacekeeping hinges on our collective commitment to continue to adapt and invest so we can continue delivering hope and protection where it’s needed most.”
 






The first UN peacekeeping operation was established in 1948. Today, more than 68,000 personnel serve in 11 missions.
Pakistan is the fifth-largest contributor of uniformed personnel, currently deploying over 2,800 military and police personnel to UN operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Somalia, South Sudan, and Western Sahara.
International Day of UN Peacekeepers, established in 2002, honours the more than 4,400 peacekeepers who have died in the line of duty over the past 77 years, with 57 fatalities recorded in 2024 alone.

The protest call was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Committee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Importers and Exporters Association, the Nagar Chamber of Commerce, and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit. Protesters chanted slogans against Pakistan Customs and the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government.
According to the protesters, the primary grievance is the suspension of customs clearance for imported consignments from China at Sost Dry Port for the last six months, effectively halting Pak-China trade.
According to traders, 257 consignments imported from China have been stuck at Sost Dry port since December last year, causing “billions of rupees losses” from expired items, daily port charges, and other expenses. They demanded that the stranded consignments be cleared through a “one-time amnesty scheme” as they cannot absorb the damages.

Demand ‘one-time amnesty’ for over 250 consignments stuck at Sost since last year

 
 

They highlighted that a large portion of GB’s population, including transporters, hotel owners, shopkeepers, labourers and customs agents, depends on this trade due to a lack of other job opportunities. Also, new policies of Pakistan Customs were described as “anti-poor”, rendering thousands jobless.
Further demands include exempting consignments at Sost Dry Port from misdeclaration cases, arguing it’s challenging to prepare detailed packing lists and invoices under the current Chinese import circumstances, where traders buy various items from multiple shops.
They also requested permission to submit import documents after examination of consignments at Sost.
Traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province under the 1985 border agreement. They asked that goods imported by border pass holders be cleared separately near the Sost customs check post, continuing a 40-year practice.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within Gilgit-Baltistan, where facilities already exist, rather than being transported out. A comprehensive future policy is sought to ensure uninterrupted trade.
Initially, organisers had planned a car march to Sost town near Khunjerab Pass on Friday to decide on joint protest actions. However, when convoys from Gilgit and Nagar began to move towards Sost, the administration deployed police at the KKH in Pissan, the Ganish bridge in Hunza, and other connecting roads.
 
 

A convoy of hundreds of vehicles from Gulmat Nagar was stopped by the police, leading protesters to stage a sit-in at Pissan, which was later joined by other rally participants.
Addressing protesters, Ebad Nagri, Mir Abbas, Muhammad Ismail and others said they initially had no plan for a sit-in but decided on it after police stopped their march to Sost.
Protesters claimed they were protesting peacefully but accused the government of “trying to make it violent”. They noted the local administration had imposed Section 144 — a provision often used to suppress public gatherings — despite no law-and-order situation. They said the sit-in would continue until their demands were met.
“GB has no representation in parliament and other federal institutions, but still always remains in the forefront to defend the country,” said Abbas Mir, an organiser, criticising the federal government for crippling Gilgit-Baltistan’s financial lifelines. He added that political, religious, and regional parties supported their protest.
Protesters said they had met high-level officials over the past six months, but to no avail. Ebad Nagri announced that the protest “will only be called off after the fulfilment of our demands”.

• Says millions of lives must not be held hostage to ‘narrow political gains’
• Terms 2022 floods a consequence of glacial melt
• Tajik president wants global plan to save melting glaciers
DUSHANBE: Rejecting the “weaponisation of water”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the “red line” by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, describing any such move as a reckless act that would jeopardise millions of lives for narrow political gain.
“India’s unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin’s water, is deeply regrettable,” the prime mi­n­ister said while addr­essing the High-Level Int­e­rnational Conference on Glaciers Preservation. “Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed.”
The three-day conference, held in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe from May 29-31, brought toge­ther over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international orga­ni­sations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
 
 

Hosted by the government of Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations, Unesco, World Meteorological Organisa­tion (WMO), and the Asian Development Bank, the summit aimed to push forward the agenda for glacier protection and international climate cooperation.
In his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz touched all the relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water, and a call to protect nature and humanity’s shared destiny.
“The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low — the weaponisation of water,” he told participants.
The 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, through a resolution, declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers Preservation, designated 21 March as the annual World Day for Glaciers beginning in 2025, and assigned the government of Tajikistan to host the inaugural international conference on the subject that year.
Prime Minister Shehbaz reminded the international audience that Pakistan, with over 13,000 glaciers, was among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. These glaciers contribute nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus River system, which sustains Pakistan’s civilisation, culture and economy.
“The five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape — Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,” he added.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He told the international gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022, which destroyed millions of acres of standing crops and hundreds of thousands of houses and infrastructure, despite Pakistan’s only less than half a per cent contribution to the total world emissions.
Referring to the “sobering” scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in our region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.
“These changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences — lost livelihoods, displaced families and deep chaos,” he warned.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.
“The developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage,” the prime minister said.
“Adequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries. Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management,” he added.
Measures to protect glaciers
President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, co-hosting the international conference, called on the world to take urgent and coordinated action to safeguard glaciers, warning that their rapid melting poses a global crisis.
“I want to note clearly that glaciers preservation is not just a problem of countries with glaciers but rather a global crisis that deserves the immediate attention of the international community,” President Rahmon said.
He urged comprehensive monitoring and scientific research to better understand glacier dynamics, their role in ecosystems and their socio-economic impacts.
He suggested that countries with the ability to collect accurate data on the state of glaciers, particularly through satellites, should establish a regular exchange of information with countries that lack such capabilities.
The president called for implementing collective actions to address the socio-economic consequences of glacier melting, including its impact on accessing water, ensuring food security, producing electricity, and protecting cultural and natural heritage.
“We must make every effort to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and take the necessary measures to prevent an increase in global temperature,” he said.
Tajikistan, with 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains, is home to the largest glaciers in Central Asia. “So far, 1,300 out of 14,000 glaciers have completely melted. These glaciers supply 60pc of the region’s drinking water,” he said.
President Rahmon stressed that climate change had already caused the loss of about a third of mountain glaciers around the world and this process is not just an environmental problem but is closely related to many aspects of human life. “Tajikistan’s glaciers are vital not just for regional rivers, but for climate stability worldwide,” he said.
Citing the Fedchenko Glacier, one of the world’s largest continental glaciers, President Rahmon said it could yield thousands of years of climate data crucial for future strategies. He called on all countries to support Tajikistan’s proposal to develop a global preservation framework under the United Nations.

Chairman Asghar Ali Tareen, while presiding over the PAC meeting, uncovered un­­accounted expenditures, violations of procurement laws, and delayed mega projects.
The meeting was attended by committee members engineers Zamrak Khan Achak­zai, Zabid Ali Reki, Ghulam Dostgir Badini, Fazal Qadir Mandokhail, PHE Secretary Imran Gichki, DG Audit Balochistan Shuja Ali, Additional Accountant General Hafiz Noorul Haq, PAC Additional Secretary Siraj Lahri, Director Audit Dr Faiz Muhammad Jaffar, and Chief Accounts Officer Syed Idris. Opposition Leader Younis Aziz Zehri and Maulana Hidayatur Rahman were invited as special guests.
 
 

During the meeting, the DG audit presented a special audit report conducted in November 2022 covering the financial years from 2018 to 2021 for the PHE department, Gwadar.
The report revealed that the department incurred expenses exceeding Rs5.9 billion, however, significant amounts remained unaccounted for in official records, raising serious transparency concerns.

Audit shows over Rs5.9bn in unaccounted-for expenses between 2018 and 2021

It further disclosed that no income tax deductions were made on payments totaling nearly Rs240m, which were disbursed without legal deductions.
Work worth approximately Rs4.9bn was awarded to various companies without tenders, violating procurement laws. The audit also pointed to irregularities worth over Rs380m in schemes for water supply during drought conditions.
Irregularities were also found in the procurement of fuel, oil, lubricants, and repair materials. The executive engineer in Gwadar made multi-crore purchases from different companies without proper documentation, leading the committee to classify these expenditures as suspicious.
The members of the committee expressed strong reservations and demanded inquiry proceedings against responsible officers for failing to provide complete records.
Mr Tareen emphasised in his address that safeguarding public funds is a top priority and warned that anyone found misusing national resources would not be spared. He assured that while an opportunity for explanation would be given, strict action would follow if irregularities were confirmed.
Maulana Hidayatur Rahman, speaking on the occasion, criticised the Gwadar water project expenditures, stating billions had been spent but honest utilisation could have ensured water availability from Singapore by ship.
In his remarks, Fazal Qadir Mandokhail suggested referring the matter to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), though other members advocated for full fact-finding before the chairman exercises his authority.
The meeting also reviewed the audit report of the Mangi Dam project, which was due to be completed in June 2022 but faced extraordinary delays and a 42 per cent cost overrun. The initial estimated cost of Rs7bn has now crossed to over Rs18bn. The audit attributed these issues to consultant inefficiency and poor planning, with key aspects ignored in the initial PC-1 document and recurring revision needs.
The DG audit reported that the department had not yet submitted any progress report on the project, drawing strong condemnation from the committee. PAC Chairman Tareen described this as an example of extreme institutional failure, pointing out that despite such a major project, public still live without access to clean drinking water.
He announced plans to personally visit the Mangi Dam site with committee members for on-ground assessment.
The project director informed the meeting that completion was possible by December 2025 if the required funds were released promptly. Mr Tareen decided to write to the Balochistan chief secretary to expedite fund release and warned of another special audit if the project fails to complete on time.
Further disclosures included that over 1.43 million litres of diesel were used to supply water to Gwadar, with fuel distributed to tankers without proper record keeping or storage details in logbooks, violating procurement rules.
The chairman stated that the committee would not only expose financial corruption but also initiate strict legal action to restore public trust in Balochistan’s governance.

The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost 2024 general election from NA-18 (Haripur) to Omar Ayub Khan with a margin of 82,000 votes. 
The ECP instantly fixed the reference for first hearing on June 4 and notices have been issued to both Mr Ayub and Mr Nawaz. 
On the same day, the ECP will also resume hearing on a petition filed by Mr Nawaz on May 11,2024 seeking action over alleged rigging in his constituency. 
He had also demanded a thorough probe into the alleged rigging. In his petition, the former MNA had alleged that Mr Ayub was guilty of financial corruption and misrepresentation in the affidavit submitted to the election commission. 
One of the interesting claims made by Mr Nawaz was that the PTI leader had himself complained of rigging in elections on February 9. 
A source in PTI, however, rejected the claim that the party had written a letter to the DRO complaining over its own victory with a margin of 82,000 votes. He said the fake letter had never been written by the PTI and was not there on the official record. 
He said the DRO concerned had also denied receiving such a letter. He also pointed out that Mr Nawaz in his posts on social media including X and Facebook had accepted his defeat with open heart and had congratulated Mr Ayub. 
The source further said Mr Nawaz filed his petition on May 11, 2024, after 24 days from the date of expiry of filing of the petition deadline (April 17). 
He alleged the state machinery and ECP have been activated once again as a tool to deprive PTI of those seats they could not manage to steal after elections. 
On April 18, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had lifted the stay order that had halted the ECP’s probe into alleged rigging in NA-18 Haripur, directing the electoral body to proceed with the case after hearing all concerned parties. 
Announcing the reserved verdict, Acting Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar dismissed the petition filed by mr Ayub, which had sought to block the ECP’s inquiry into the alleged irregularities. 
On April 23, the PTI leader challenged in the Supreme Court the ECP’s jurisdiction to proceed with a representation filed by his rival candidate, Babar Nawaz Khan, under sections 8, 9, and 95 of the Elections Act, 2017.
The petitioner argued that the ECP became functus officio (lacking jurisdiction) after the statutory 60-day period from the Feb 17, 2024 notification of the returned candidate expired on April 17, 2024. Despite this, the ECP continued proceedings, which he contended was unlawful.

“Pakistan’s nuclear weapon program is the sole guarantor of peace and stability in South Asia,” Gen Kidwai said in his keynote at a round table discussion hosted by the Center for International Strategic Studies to mark the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s 1998 nuclear tests.
Speakers at the event described India’s resp­onse as a reckless attempt to challenge Pakistan’s strategic restraint.
Among others who spoke at the meeting were former foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood, director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad; Muhammad Naeem, former chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission; Dr Adil Sultan, dean of Air University; and retired Brig Dr Zahirul Haider Kazmi, adviser on arms control at the Strategic Plans Division.
The speakers warned of an emerging pattern in which India employs false flag operations as pretexts for limited military strikes, ignoring the risks inherent in a nuclearised environment. Such beha­v­iour, they said, could trigger catastrophic misjudgments with far-reaching consequences.
“India has shown a pattern of conducting false flag operations as a casus belli to justify aggressive actions against Pakistan, disregarding the prevailing nuclear environment and deliberately testing the limits of Pakistan’s conventional capabilities and nuclear thresholds,” CISS said in a statement on the discussion.
“Pakistan’s credible nuclear capability, operationalised through Full Spectrum Deterrence, remains the cornerstone of peace in South Asia,” one of the speakers said, arguing that the recent confrontation underscored the continued relevance of nuclear deterrence in preventing conflict escalation.
They also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to respond to future provocations with a range of kinetic and non-kinetic options, as part of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’ strategy — defined as swift, and precise retaliation aimed at deterring escalation and compelling de-escalation.
