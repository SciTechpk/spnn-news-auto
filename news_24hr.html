The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.

Radiation ‘unchanged’ in Iran’s Natanz area; ‘limited damage’ to Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites


“We are currently launching attacks on several sites in Iran,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said in a televised press conference following an overnight barrage of missiles and drones launched by Iran.
Defrin later said that Israel’s ongoing air campaign had created “aerial freedom of action” from western Iran to Tehran.
“We have created aerial freedom of action from west Iran all the way to Tehran… Tehran is no longer immune,” he told journalists, adding that the air force “launched a massive strike involving more than 70 fighter jets, targeting objectives in Tehran” overnight.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported that two Revolutionary Guards were killed in an Israeli strike on a base in central Iran.
“Following the brutal attack by the Zionist regime on the Zarandiyeh Basij base, two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were martyred,” the news agency said, citing the Guards.
The student-run ISNA network, meanwhile, reportedthat  a police chief and another officer were killed in a drone strike about 300 kilometres west of Tehran.
“This morning, police chief Major Habibollah Akbarian, along with second lieutenant Amir Hossein Seifi, were martyred by a drone strike in Asadabad city in the western province of Hamedan,” ISNA reported.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military said that its air strikes on Iran had killed more than 20 Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders.
“Since the beginning of the operation (on Friday), over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime’s security apparatus have been eliminated,” the military said in a statement, naming several top commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the armed forces.
Iran’s state-owned broadcaster Press TV reported that an Israeli F-35 fighter jet had been shot down in the western part of the country on Saturday.
“Iranian Army’s Public Relations Office said in a statement … that its air defence forces had successfully struck and destroyed another F-35 fighter jet belonging to the Israeli regime over the western part of the country,” the report read.
Press TV reported that “the fate of the pilot remains unknown and is currently under investigation”, adding that more information would be released in due course.
Yesterday, IRNA said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.
Earlier today, Iranian media reported Israeli strikes in cities in the west and northwest, which house key defences and military bases.
The Fars and Mehr news agencies said the strikes hit the northwestern city of Tabriz as well as parts of the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah.
The Tabriz Oil Refinery Company, however, denied reports of any attack or damage to its facilities and said its operational activities are being carried out as usual.
Fars said two projectiles hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.
The Tasnim news agency reported on X that an Israeli drone struck the Hakim Children’s Hospital in Tehran.
“A hostile drone launched by the Israeli regime hit Hakim Children’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences,” the agency reported, quoting a statement from the university’s public relations office.
 






Blasts were heard across the capital as Iran activated its air defences against the incoming fire.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.
 


After his country claimed to have struck multiple targets in Iran, Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened that “Tehran will burn” if Iran fired more missiles at Israel.
“The Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages and bringing about a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price because of the criminal harm to Israeli civilians,” Katz was quoted as saying in a statement.
“If [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles toward the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn.”
Israel’s military also said its fighter jets were set to resume striking targets in Tehran, after announcing it had hit air defences in the area of the Iranian capital overnight.
“The way to Iran has been paved,” the military’s chief of staff and air force chief were quoted as saying in an army statement.
The military “is proceeding according to its operational plans, and [Israeli air force] fighter jets are set to resume striking targets in Tehran”, it added.
 


Israel claimed it struck dozens of targets in Tehran overnight, which included “surface-to-air missile infrastructures as part of an effort to dismantle” air defence capabilities around Iran’s capital, Al Jazeera reported.
The Israeli army claimed: “For the first time since the beginning of the war, over 1,500km from Israeli territory, the [Israeli air force] struck defence arrays in the area of Tehran.”
“We damaged — and will continue to damage — strategic sites and enemy sources of knowledge,” the commanding officer of the Israeli air force, MG Tomer Bar, was quoted as saying in a military statement.
Iranian forces shot down Israeli drones on a reconnaissance mission over the northwest, state media reported, as exchanges of fire between the two sides continued.
“Islamic fighters (Iranian forces) in the Salmas border region successfully shot down Israeli drones that had violated the country’s airspace,” state television said, adding that the “drones had entered Iranian airspace on espionage and reconnaissance missions”.
Meanwhile, Baghdad asked Tehran not to target US interests on Iraqi soil, a senior security official said on Saturday amid the heightened tensions.
Fearing being caught up in a regional escalation, the Iraqi government asked Tehran not to strike in its territory, a senior Iraqi security official told AFP.
“The request was made. They promised us positive things,” said the official, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The official added that Tehran has shown understanding with regards to Baghdad’s request.
Meanwhile, IRINN reported that the closure of the strategic Strait of Hormuz was being seriously reviewed by Iran, citing statements by Esmail Kosari, a member of the parliament’s security commission.
The Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Oman and Iran, is the world’s most important gateway for oil shipping.
2 dead, ‘some 40’ wounded in Tel Aviv
In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran. This followed an initial salvo of over 100 missiles late on Friday night under “Operation True Promise 3”.
Tehran Times stated there were “at least five rounds of ballistic missile attacks”.
It further said several of the army’s Arash kamikaze drones “successfully penetrated the occupied territories and struck their targets”, referring to Israel.
A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said the operation would continue for “as long as necessary”, according to Iranian state media IRNA.
 






Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.
The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran
An Israeli military official said Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel, claiming most of which were intercepted. AFP images of the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris.
A man and a woman were killed in Israel and dozens were wounded by a missile that landed near their homes, Israel’s ambulance service said.
Rescue teams were searching the rubble of apartment buildings that were destroyed in Rishon Lezion, a city outside of Tel Aviv.
Earlier today, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said “some 40 people”, besides the woman, were injured by the Iranian strikes.
“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
 






“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.
“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.
He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.
Brigadier General Ahmadi Vahidi, a top advisor to the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, claimed his country hit three Israeli airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported.
Gen Vahidi said the sites included the Nevatim and Ovda airbases, in which the Israeli regime’s command and control, as well as the electronic warfare centre, were located. Other sites, he added, included the Tel Nof airbase near Tel Aviv, Israel’s defence ministry, as well as its industrial and military centres in the capital.
 






In a statement carried by Tasnim, the IRGC said: “In this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation.”
It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.
“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.
A senior Iranian official told CNN that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official told CNN.
Katz said the Iranian leadership had crossed a red line by firing at “civilians” and would “pay a heavy price for it”.
Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an AFP journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.
Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
Resident Chen Gabizon told AFP he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.
“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.

‘Limited damage’ to Fordow, Isfahan nuclear sites
Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.
There was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.
It said that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country’s atomic energy organisation.
“There has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,” Kamalvandi said.
“We had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.”
However, an Israeli military official claimed the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were significantly damaged due to Israeli strikes, according to Reuters.
The official said that it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair damage at the two sites.
Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.
Iranian outlets Mehr and Tasnim also reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports, according to Times of Israel.
Meanwhile, Iran’s civil aviation authority has declared the country’s airspace closed “until further notice”, IRNA reported.

“No flights will be operated at any airports in the country in order to protect the safety of passengers… until further notice,” the news agency said.
Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport was also closed until further notice, a spokeswoman said. “There is no date or day set to reopen the airport,” airport spokeswoman Lisa Diver told AFP.
Yesterday’s attacks prompted several countries in the region to temporarily ground air traffic, though on Saturday morning, Jordan reopened its airspace.
Calls for dialogue
After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, Pope Leo appealed on Saturday for authorities in Iran and Israel to act with “reason” after recent airstrikes and to pursue dialogue.
He told an audience in St. Peter’s Basilica he was following the situation with “great concern”. “In such a delicate moment, I strongly wish to renew an appeal to responsibility and to reason,” said the pope.
“The commitment to building a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through respectful encounters and sincere dialogue to build a lasting peace, founded on justice, fraternity, and the common good,” he said.
“No one should ever threaten the existence of another,” said Leo. “It is the duty of all countries to support the cause of peace, initiating paths of reconciliation and promoting solutions that guarantee security and dignity for all.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi in a phone call on Saturday that Moscow condemns Israel’s use of force against Iran and is ready to help de-escalate the situation in the Middle East.
“Russia is prepared to continue to work to resolve issues surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called for the two nations to cease fire.
“Enough escalation. Time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail,” he wrote on X earlier today.
 






US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.
US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.
Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.
Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC’ air force.
It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.
 






In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.
“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.
Continuing Iran-US talks is ‘unjustifiable’: Iran FM
Meanwhile, Iran said the dialogue with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme is “unjustifiable” after Israel’s biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, seemingly abandoning planned talks on Sunday.
“Continuing Iran-US nuclear talks is unjustifiable while barbarous Israeli attacks persist on the country, Iranian state media quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying on Saturday.
Earlier, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Israel’s attack on Iran made the talks “meaningless”, while adding that it was uncertain Iran would attend Sunday’s round of talks in Oman.
“The other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran’s territory,” state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.
“It is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,” Baghaei was quoted as saying.
He said Israel “succeeded in influencing” the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington’s permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.
 
 

Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel’s attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be “wise” to negotiate over its nuclear programme.
Tehran said Washington would be “responsible for consequences” as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.
The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s sixth round of talks planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.
Iran has consistently denied that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.
Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund 2015 agreement with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.
‘We knew everything’: Trump still hopeful for deal
After the first wave of strikes on Friday, Trump urged Iran to “make a deal” while noting that a 60-day ultimatum had expired. He added that Washington was “hoping to get back to the negotiating table”.
 


After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump told Reuters in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.
“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.
“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.
Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “excellent” and “very successful” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israel’s strikes against Iran a “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved, while also urging Tehran not to target US interests or personnel in the region.
However, a US official told AFP that Washington was helping Israel defend against Iranian missile attacks.
New military brass appointed after commanders killed
The strikes killed Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and Revolutionary Guards’ head Hossein Salami, Iranian media reported.
Tasnim reported today that General Gholamreza Mehrabi, deputy head of intelligence of the armed forces general staff, and General Mehdi Rabbani, deputy head of operations, were confirmed to have been killed in Israel’s attacks from yesterday.

Khamenei swiftly appointed new commanders to replace those killed. Major General Seyyed Abdulrahim Mousavi was appointed to replace Bagheri, while Major Gen Mohammad Pakpour was chosen as the new head of the IRGC, according to IRNA. Gen Amir Hatami was made the new army chief.
 
 

Iran confirmed that the IRGC’s aerospace commander Major Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh had been killed, along with “a group of brave and dedicated fighters”. Khamenei today appointed IRGC Brigadier General Seyyed Majid Mousavi to replace him, Mehr reported.
Meanwhile, three more Iranian nuclear scientists were confirmed dead in Israeli attacks, Mehr news posted on X, taking the total number of experts killed to nine.
Mehr did not specify whether Ali Bakaei Karimi, Mansour Asgari and Saeed Borji were killed in yesterday’s strikes or today’s. The Israeli army also shared the names of the nine scientists in a video on X today.
 


“The senior chain of command of the air force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had assembled in an underground command centre to prepare for an attack on the State of Israel,” the Israeli military said, adding that its attacks had killed most of them.
AFP images showed a gaping hole in the side of a Tehran residential building that appeared to have sustained a targeted strike.
Tasnim news agency said six nuclear scientists were among the dead — namely Abdolhamid Minoochehr, Ahmad Reza Zolfaqari, Seyed Amir Hossein Feqhi, Matlabizadeh, Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi and Fereydoon Abbasi.
Oil prices surged while stocks sank on the Israeli strikes.

There were reports of new Israeli strikes in Iran earlier today as Tel Aviv warned “Tehran will burn” after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli onslaught on its nuclear facilities that killed its top generals.
The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.
According to PTV News, the PM spoke over the phone to Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, informing him that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the “brotherly people of Iran against Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression”.
“He (the PM) strongly condemned the Israeli attacks against Iran, which are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a complete violation of the UN Charter and international law,” the report read. The PM added that Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
“The prime minister condemned Israel’s provocations and adventurism, calling them a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” PTV News reported. “He also strongly condemned Israel’s unabated acts of brutal genocide against the brave Palestinians.”
According to PTV News, PM Shehbaz urged the international community and the UN to take “immediate and credible steps” against Israeli aggression, stating that Pakistan is fully committed to promoting peace in the region.
Pezeshkian thanked the PM for Pakistan’s support, saying that this was a “reflection of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries”.
PTV News reported that Pezeshkian apprised PM Shehbaz of Iran’s perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, especially Islamic countries, to work together to confront these threats. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.
 






‘Cannot afford Iraq 2.0 or WWIII’: Bilawal
While addressing a press conference in Brussels, Bilawal said, “We certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.
“We will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders. Be it with Afghanistan, be it with Iran, be it with India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.”
 






He said that it had become “far too easy to have a war every month” and added that war had become the “default setting” that “whenever there is a conflict or dispute, to launch into a full-scale war”.
Bilawal called on the international community to “immediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine”.
“We cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests,” he added.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.
The delegation comprises Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
‘Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests’: Khawaja Asif
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said that Pakistan will “safeguard Iran’s interests” amid exchanges of missiles between Tehran and Israel, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
Condemning the Israeli attack on Pakistan’s “neighbour and fraternal country” during a session of parliament, the defence minister urged that a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) be convened to launch an initiative that “manifests the unity of [the] Muslim Ummah”.
“Pakistan stands firm on its traditional stance, as it has neither recognised Israel nor established relations with it,” Asif said. “Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests at all international fora, including the United Nations.”</p><small>2025-06-14 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609184-sindh-warns-centre-over-development-budget-calls-for-end-to-stepmotherly-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad lashes out at Centre over sidelining Sindh in federal projects</strong></a><br><p>

The NEV policy incl­udes a subsidy of Rs50,000 for electric mot­orcycles and Rs200,000 for rickshaws, with a total subsidy allocation of Rs4 billion. In addition, the policy provides for subsidies and support to establish electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging stations.
The PM issued these orders while chairing a high-level meeting today to review and discuss the policy framework.
“[Pakistan needs] swift and priority-based measures to promote electric motorcycles, scooters, three-wheelers, cars, and buses,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.
He also underscored the importance of establishing charging infrastructure, including charging stations and battery swapping facilities, to support the expansion of the EV ecosystem.
“Relevant industries should be facilitated to enhance the local manufacturing capacity of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers,” the PM added.
The meeting was attended by Federal Ministers Rana Tanveer Hussain, Ahmad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, and other senior government officials.
Earlier this week, 57 manufacturers were granted licences to produce EVs, supported by fiscal incentives, tax exemptions, and reduced charging tariffs aligned with the government’s ‘Clean Green Pakistan’ and ‘Make in Pakistan’ initiatives.
Meanwhile, the Sindh government on June 11 decided to purchase more buses and allocate funds for EV taxis and scooters in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon, where various projects, including the People’s Bus Service, EV scooters, and others, were reviewed and discussed.</p><small>2025-06-14 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1418264207954a1.jpg?r=185525' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917117/protests-middle-east-and-bad-weather-may-rain-on-trumps-military-parade' target='_blank'><strong>Protests, Middle East — and bad weather — may rain on Trump’s military parade</strong></a><br><p>Nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, tensions in the Middle East amid Israel’s strikes on Iran and expected rainy weather in Washington on Saturday could dampen spirits at a military parade on the US Army’s 250th anniversary, set to feature tanks on the streets and aircraft flying overhead.
Trump, whose 79th birthday is also on Saturday, will preside over the parade.
Week-long protests in Los Angeles against Trump’s immigration crackdown have spread to multiple cities including Chicago, New York, San Antonio, Texas, and Washington.
The Republican president has ordered National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles, a heavily Democratic city — a deployment that California Governor Gavin Newsom has challenged in court.
Anti-Trump groups are planning to hold nearly 2,000 demonstrations of varying sizes across the country to coincide with the parade. Many are taking place under the theme “No Kings,” asserting that no individual is above the law.
The protests, if they go as planned, would represent one of the biggest public displays of opposition to Trump since he returned to power in January.
Parade goers in Washington will encounter a massive security presence, with some 18.5 miles (30 km) of 8-foot (2.4 m)-high black fencing, much of it reinforced with concrete traffic barriers, cordoning off streets and surrounding landmarks including the Washington Monument.
The celebrations will cost the US Army between $25 million and $45m, US officials have told Reuters. That includes the parade itself as well as the cost of moving equipment and housing and feeding the troops.
Critics have called the parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially given Trump has said he wants to slash costs throughout the federal government.
“You’re not doing it to celebrate the army’s birthday. You’re doing it to stroke Donald Trump’s ego,” Democratic US Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Army combat veteran who lost two legs in the Iraq war, said at a hearing this month.
“If you want to celebrate the army’s birthday by spending $30m, I would recommend you think about something along the lines of maybe spending that money on childcare for military families, perhaps tuition reimbursement for military families.”

‘I don’t feel like a king’
At least one organisation, RefuseFascism.org, has a permit to hold a march in central Washington that will culminate in a rally opposite the White House. Trump has warned people against protesting at the parade itself, saying that “they’re going to be met with very big force”.
The protests, and any response by law enforcement agencies, will form a contrasting backdrop to the day-long celebration of the US Army’s history, which will seek to honour different eras of military history with uniforms and military weaponry from those periods.
“I don’t feel like a king, I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “We’re not a king, we’re not a king at all.”
While the army has said the parade will take place come rain or shine, weather forecasts for Saturday evening show the potential for heavy thunderstorms in the Washington area.
Defenders of the plans say the US Army’s 250th anniversary is a unique event that deserves an outsized celebration.
The display of US military hardware will take place shortly after one of the nation’s closest allies, Israel, launched a barrage of strikes across Iran, which has threatened a harsh response.
Rare spectacle
Military parades in the United States are rare. Other countries usually stage them to celebrate victories in battle or showcase military might.
In 1991, tanks and thousands of troops paraded through Washington to celebrate the ousting of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in the Gulf War.
Law enforcement agencies are preparing for hundreds of thousands of people to attend Saturday’s parade.
Thousands of agents, officers and specialists will be deployed from law enforcement agencies from across the country and drones operated by the Secret Service will keep watch overhead.
The Federal Aviation Administration will close down arrivals and departures at Washington’s Reagan National Airport during the peak of the celebration.
While the army has said it has no plans to recognise Trump’s birthday, the president will play a major role in the celebrations.
 
 

The US Army has brought nearly 7,000 troops into Washington, along with 150 vehicles, including more than 25 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker armoured vehicles, four Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicles, and artillery pieces including the M777 and M119.
The flyover will include Apache and Black Hawk helicopters along with Chinooks. Older aircraft like the World War II-era B-25 bomber and P-51 Mustang will also take part.
The military has taken steps to protect the streets of the capital from any potential damage caused by heavy tanks, including laying down metal plates in some areas.
The US Army has said it will pay for any unexpected repairs if needed and has set aside several million dollars in case of damage, although it has said it expects little impact.

But it was an edgy finish as they took 27.4 overs to slowly score the 69 runs needed to secure success on the fourth day at Lord’s after resuming at 213-2 overnight.
In so doing, South Africa completed a successful pursuit of the joint second-highest winning fourth-innings total in test history at the London venue.
It was a first major cricket triumph for South Africa, who had earned an unwanted reputation for failure when on the cusp of victory over the last decades in limited overs competitions.
This was their first appearance in the WTC final, with opener Aiden Markram delivering a heroic innings of 136 to ensure success.
Markram, who reached his century late in the third day, added 34 more runs on Saturday, accumulating carefully before falling to a sharp catch by Travis Head with six runs needed to win.
Kyle Verreynne hit the winning run and was four not out at the end along with David Bedingham, who scored an unbeaten 21.
Nerves
“It was the most nervous I’ve ever been. I didn’t want to come out and bat, but when Aiden went out, I had to,” said Verreynne.
South Africa started the fourth day as favourites to win, but nervy, given a litany of past disasters, and would have been further on edge when captain Temba Bavuma was out in the third over of the morning.
A rising delivery from Australia skipper Pat Cummins took an edge and saw Bavuma depart, having added only one run to his overnight total of 65.
Australia made two unsuccessful reviews of not-out decisions as they sought a further breakthrough before Mitchell Starc clean bowled Tristan Stubbs for eight, with 41 runs still needed.
 
 

Markram and Bedingham then diligently put together a 35-run partnership to see them to the brink of success, before the win was secured in the last over before lunch.
South Africa, which came into the contest as underdogs, won the toss on the opening day and gambled by putting Australia into bat. But with Kagiso Rabada returning figures of 5-51, they were vindicated as the defending champions were dismissed for 212.
South Africa’s reply of 138 meant Australia had a 74-run lead, significantly increased after scoring 207 in their second innings, with their tail order recovering after they had slumped to 73-7.
But South Africa profited from a dramatic change in the pitch conditions, after 24 wickets fell on the first two days to patiently bat themselves to a landmark victory.</p><small>2025-06-14 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14163008dcfcddd.jpg?r=163222' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917110/canadas-sikhs-voice-outrage-over-modi-g7-invitation' target='_blank'><strong>Canada’s Sikhs voice outrage over Modi G7 invitation</strong></a><br><p>Members of Canada’s Sikh community, who were warned by police that their lives were at risk and allege the Indian government is responsible for the threat, are incensed by Ottawa’s invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Modi, although India is not a G7 member, to attend the summit, which starts on Sunday, as a guest. It will be Modi’s first visit to Canada in a decade and a diplomatic test for Carney, a political neophyte.
Canada’s relationship with India has been tense since former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2023 accused India’s government of involvement in the June 18, 2023 murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.
Modi’s government has denied involvement in Nijjar’s killing and has accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
“‘Outrage’ is the kind of term that I’ve heard from people,” Sikh activist Moninder Singh, a friend of Nijjar, said of the invitation.
He and other Sikh leaders plan to hold a protest in Ottawa on Saturday.
Carney, locked in a trade war with the United States, is trying to shore up alliances elsewhere and diversify Canada’s exports. Carney told reporters he invited India due to its importance in global supply chains.
 
 

India’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a Thursday press briefing that a meeting between Modi and Carney “will offer an important opportunity for them to exchange views on bilateral and global issues and explore pathways to set or reset the relationship”.
Sikhs face threats
That rationale rings hollow for Singh, who lives in British Columbia. He has received multiple warnings from police that his life was at risk. One such warning forced him from his home for months in 2023 for his children’s safety.
“On a personal level, and on a community level, as well, it was deeply insulting … Sikh lives aren’t as important as the fifth-largest economy in the world that needs to be at the table,” he said.
A spokesperson for Carney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in October that they had communicated more than a dozen threats to people like Singh who are advocating for the creation of a Sikh homeland carved out of India.
In October, under Trudeau, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, linking them to Nijjar’s murder and alleging a broader government effort to target Indian dissidents in Canada through killings, extortion, the use of organised crime and clandestine information-gathering.
India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats and called the allegations preposterous and politically motivated. Canada has said it does not have evidence linking Modi to the threats.
The tension has thrust Canada’s Sikh community — the largest outside India’s Sikh-majority Punjab state — into the spotlight. Singh said there should have been conditions on Modi’s invitation.
“Any meetings with them should have been under the conditions that Mr. Modi and his government would take responsibility for what has been uncovered and cooperate, but none of that happened.”
Carney told reporters Modi had agreed to “law enforcement dialogue”.
Jaiswal said Indian and Canadian law enforcement agencies will continue to cooperate in some ways.
Some activists and politicians in Canada have accused Carney of putting economic issues ahead of human rights concerns. But Sanjay Ruparelia, a politics professor at Toronto Metropolitan University, said the prime minister is simply being practical.
“[Carney’s] watchword since he’s come to office is pragmatism. And this is very much a pragmatic, realpolitik decision.”</p><small>2025-06-14 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/140839113f67762.jpg?r=084036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917045/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‘grave threat to world peace’ posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.
Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.
Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy
Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.
“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.
She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned resumption of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.
DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.
“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.
“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”
Also briefing the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.
He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.
“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.
He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.
“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”
Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.
“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”
Pakistan came out strongly in support of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.
The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.
 






When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.
It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.
He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14151153345f7bd.jpg?r=151620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107/delhi-launches-inspection-of-boeing-787s-after-air-india-crash' target='_blank'><strong>Delhi launches inspection of Boeing 787s after Air India crash</strong></a><br><p>India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India crash that claimed at least 279 lives this week, the country’s aviation minister said on Saturday, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.
The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.
“We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi, without saying if the checks will apply to all Indian airlines.
“Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.” Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.
The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday told Reuters the Indian government was considering that as an option.
Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down, Reuters has reported.
Forensic teams are still looking for the second black box as they probe why the plane lost height and crashed straight after takeoff.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at B.J. Medical College, told reporters.
Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.
The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022. Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.
Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.
 
 

Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from authorities and was “very hassled”.
“We have lost our children … we are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children. Tell us when they are going to release their bodies,” Memon said.
 

Rafiq Memon, a relative of Javed Ali Syed, who along with his wife and two children died after the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane bound for London’s Gatwick Airport crashed during take-off from Ahmedabad, talks to media outside the DNA sample collection room at a hospital in Ahmedabad, India June 14, 2025. — Reuters

Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it would take 72 hours for DNA profiling. “The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.
Most bodies in the crash were badly charred, and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.
Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609160-tensions-to-increase-sans-pakistan-india-dialogue-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Tensions to increase sans Pakistan-India dialogue, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

Last month, an improvised explosive device (IED) had detonated outside the residence of MNA Zeb, partially damaging the house, police had said.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique, told Dawn.com that the rocket was fired at the residence of MNA Mubarak Zeb in Bajaur.
“However, it struck the MNA’s neighbour’s house, resulting in damage to the house walls and gate,” he added.
The MNA confirmed the attack in a post on X as well, adding that there were no casualties in the attack.
 






DPO Rafique added that there were no human casualties.
He said that miscreants had attacked the MNA’s house for the second time in the last two months.
He said that a search operation is underway in the area to track down the terrorists who launched the rocket at Zeb’s house.
Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Earlier in the week, a man was killed and two women were wounded after a mortar shell fired from Afghanistan’s side hit their house in the hilly area of Bajaur district’s Salarzai tehsil, police and residents said.
In April, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.
Also in April, eight people, including three security personnel and five residents, were injured after a roadside bomb targeted a vehicle of the Frontier Corps in the same district.</p><small>2025-06-14 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684cb99f8d3ea.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917011/petrol-diesel-to-cost-more' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol, diesel to cost more</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The pri­ces of petrol and diesel are estimated to increase by ab­­­­out Re1 and Rs5 per lit­re, respectively, for the next fortnight ending June 30, owing to higher international market prices.
Based on existing tax ra­­­­tes, informed sources said the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go up by about Re1 per litre depending on final calculation on June 15, followed by Rs5 per litre increase in high-speed diesel (HSD).
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.
 
 

The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs254.64 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary, as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines, such as trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells, and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other food items. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rates.
The government is currently charging approximately Rs94 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is still charging Rs77.01 per litre PDL on diesel and Rs78.02 per litre on petrol and high-octane products.
The government also cha­r­ges approximately Rs 16 per litre of customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of whe­ther they are locally produced or imported.
Additionally, approximately Rs17 per litre of distribution and sale margins are being allocated to oil companies and their dealers.

• Rs8.288bn kept for nine ‘ongoing mega schemes’ in metropolis
• Murad mentions plan to bring 500 e-buses to Karachi
• Says Sindh govt provided Rs26bn to KMC in outgoing fiscal year
KARACHI: Although the Sindh government has been undertaking multiple infrastructure projects in Karachi for years, for the third consecutive year, it has not announced any new “mega development scheme” for the country’s commercial capital in the provincial budget for financial year 2025-26.
Budget documents show Karachi gets no new infrastructure development scheme in the head of “Mega Schemes for Karachi City” in the Annual Development Programme for 2025-26.
However, unlike the previous budget when the provincial government had allocated just Rs1.389 billion for 11 ongoing “mega schemes”, this time Rs8.288bn has been earmarked for nine “ongoing mega schemes” in the metropolis.
 
 

Of the Rs8.28bn, the biggest allocation of Rs1.89bn has been made for the construction of a junction at Shahrah-i-Bhutto & Korangi Causeway Bridge near Qayyumabad, followed by Rs1.5bn for construction of a bridge on Malir River at N-5 (Murghikhana) and Rs1.3bn for construction of the Korangi Causeway Bridge.
Remaining six ongoing “mega schemes” are rehabilitation of Nehr-i-Khayam (Rs922.05 million); construction of storm-water drain from M-9 to Thaddo Nalla via Mehran Drain (Rs847.6m); construction of a sports complex at the Bakhtiari Youth Centre (Rs666.08m); rehabilitation of the existing drain at Manzoor Colony (Rs508.9m); rehabilitation of main roads in Sachal Goth (Rs450.65m); and Rs158.68m has been allocated for construction of Allama Iqbal Park at Federal B Area.
KCR, S-III, K-IV get no mention in budget speech
The speech of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, who presented the new budget in the provincial assembly on Friday as he also holds the portfolio of the finance department, did not even mention the long-delayed projects like Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme (K-IV) and Greater Karachi Sewerage Plan (S-III).
However, a close look at budget books reveals that the provincial government has allocated a sum of Rs450m for S-III project and a mere Rs100m for the K-IV (Phase-I, 260 MGD) in the next fiscal year.
The CM briefly mentioned some special initiatives in financial year 2025-26, including Rs12bn Karachi Urban Infrastructure Development.
However, the name of the specific projects and their allocations are yet to be disclosed.
Likewise, the CM also talked about a five million gallons per day desalination plant project without going into the specifics of its cost.
He stated: “First seawater desalination project to explore the potential of desalination as a solution to Karachi’s water shortage. It will be launched for investor solicitation in the calendar year of 2025.”
More buses for Karachi
The government also announced bringing in 500 more electric buses, exclusively for Karachi.
Speaking about the project, the CM said that 1,000 electric buses will be brought to the province “through a phased implementation plan”. He said that 500 electric buses are for Karachi, with their full integration expected to complete in financial year 2025-26.
He said that 100 new 12-meter electric buses have been ordered under an innovative rent-to-own model and the fleet will be operationalised by July.
He said the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network was also progressing, with Yellow Line nearing completion and work on Red Line has been completed by 50pc.
About the local government system, the CM stated that in the out-going financial year the provincial government provided a grant of Rs148bn to local councils, includ-ing Rs26bn to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation alone “in order to enable it to meet its operational expenditures and address the development requirements of the largest metropolis of Pakistan”.

Finance Minister Aftab Alam Afridi presented a Rs547 billion Annual Development Plan (ADP) for 2025-26. This amount is approximately 32 per cent, or Rs131bn, higher than the current year’s Rs416bn.
The allocations under the proposed development expenditure for the next fiscal year include Rs195bn for PADP, Rs39bn for districts, Rs39.6bn for merged districts, Rs92.7bn for the accelerated implementation programme for the merged districts, Rs177.1bn as foreign project assistance and Rs3.47bn for PSDP.
The budget documents reveal that the provincial government has proposed 1,349 ongoing and 810 new schemes in the development outlay for the next year.
 
 

Similarly, the number of total foreign-funded schemes in ADP 2025-26 is 49, spread across 19 different sectors, with an allocation of Rs 177.1bn, out of which Rs11.6bn is a grant and Rs165.5bn is a loan from various countries.
The budget documents show that a maximum allocation, which is 73pc, has been proposed for ongoing schemes to ensure their timely completion and to minimise throw-forward liabilities.

The budget also includes a 10 per cent increase in salaries of government employees and a 7pc rise in pensions.
The budget session, however, was marred by an unusual stand-off between the provincial government and Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who did not return a summary to call the budget session, forcing the government to convene the session through a requisition instead — perhaps for the first time in the province’s parliamentary history.
KP’s newly appointed finance minister, Aftab Alam Afridi, presented the tax-free budget, which projects federal receipts as the main revenue source, totalling Rs1.506tr. This includes Rs1.147tr from the federal divisible pool, Rs137.9bn under the one per cent share for the war on terror, Rs57.11bn in straight transfers, Rs58.15bn in windfall levy on oil, Rs34.5bn in net hydel profit (NHP) and Rs71.4bn in NHP arrears.
 
 

The province’s own tax and non-tax revenues are projected at Rs129bn, comprising Rs83.5bn in tax revenue and Rs45.5bn in non-tax revenue. Other receipts are estimated at Rs10.25bn.
Revenue estimates for the merged tribal areas have been set at Rs292.3bn, including Rs80bn as a current budgetary grant, Rs63bn in additional demand, Rs39bn under the Annual Development Prog­ra­mme (ADP), Rs50bn through the Accelerated Imp­lemen­ta­tion Programme (AIP), and Rs17bn for the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
KP has also projected Rs42.7bn under its 3pc share from other provinces for merged areas — a head under which it hasn’t received a single penny so far since the Fata merger.
Foreign project loans are ex­­pected to amount to Rs171.83bn, alongside Rs5.3bn in foreign grants. Additionally, Rs3.2bn is expected under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
 






Expenditure estimates
Total expenditure for the year is projected at Rs1.96tr, including Rs1.41tr in current expenditure and Rs547bn for development.
The current expenditure for settled districts has been set at Rs1.25tr, including Rs288.3bn for provincial salaries, Rs288.6bn for district salaries, Rs190.2bn for pensions, Rs334bn for non-salary items and Rs65.6bn for medical teaching institutions.
For the merged districts, Rs160bn has been allocated for current expenditure.
Development outlay
The Rs547bn development outlay marks the highest in the province’s history. It includes Rs195bn for provincial ADP, Rs39bn for district ADP, Rs39bn for merged areas, Rs92.7bn under AIP, Rs177.1bn for donor-funded projects, and Rs3.47bn under federal PSDP.
Presenting the budget, Mr Afridi announced a reduction in stamp duty from 2pc to 1pc on the allotment and transfer of residential and commercial properties.
Residential and commercial properties up to 4.9 marlas will now be exempt from property tax. The hotel bed tax has been cut from 10pc to 7pc, while registration and token taxes for environment-friendly vehicles will also be waived.
He stressed that no new taxes would be imposed on the merged districts or the former Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (Pata).
Health, education
He said the health budget has been increased by 19pc to Rs276bn from Rs232bn. The health card allocation will also be increased from Rs28bn to Rs35bn — a 25pc hike.
The budget for elementary and secondary education has risen by 11pc to Rs363bn from Rs327bn. An additional Rs5bn has been allocated under the education emergency initiative to enrol out-of-school children.
The budget for higher education has seen a 39pc boost, increasing from Rs36bn to Rs50bn. The universities’ budget has been raised from Rs3bn to Rs10bn.
The KP government has also announced a 10pc pay increase for current employees and a 7pc raise in pensions for retired staff.
The minimum wage has been raised from Rs36,000 to Rs40,000 per month. This sta­nds in contrast to the federal government’s budget, which did not announce any increase in the minimum wage.
Asked earlier why no hike was proposed, Federal Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the industry in particular and the private sector in general were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.

During the provincial assembly’s budget session with Speaker Babar Saleem Swati in the chair, the chief minister said that he had made it clear in a meeting attended by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir that the provincial government would never accept imposition of tax in ex-Fata and ex-Pata.
“We [KP government] are neither imposing any taxes in the erst while provincially and federally administered tribal areas nor will we play any role in tax collection by the Centre. Instead, we’ll act as an obstacle to tax collection there,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said that it was the provincial government’s “political and moral” right to discuss budgetary proposals with the founder of the ruling PTI Imran Khan.

Threatens to hamper tax collection by Centre in ex-Fata, ex-Pata

He, however, said that the federal government denied the provincial government the right to hold a meeting with Mr Khan to discuss the budget.
The chief minister pointed out that he had sent direct and indirect messages to authorities for facilitating his meeting with the PTI founder but the meeting couldn’t take place.
“If we’re denied the meeting, any decision by Imran Khan will be the decision of all of us,” he said.
Mr Gandapur asked the federal government to resolve the country’s socio-economic issues instead of hatching conspiracies against the PTI.
He said that the opposition, which had always criticised the government, should come forward with “reasonable suggestions.”
“We will accept every reasonable proposal with an open heart,” he said amid sloganeering by the opposition.
The chief minister insisted that provincial Governor Faisal Karim Kundi didn’t fulfil his constitutional obligations by refusing to sign the summary for calling the budget session, which was later requisitioned by members of the provincial assembly.
Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah told the house that the governor was empowered under Article 109 of the Constitution to call the assembly session but the provincial government hurriedly requisitioned the sitting though “several mandatory days were left for signing that summary.”
He said that he delivered 10 speeches but the opposition’s recommendations for the budget were never considered by the government.
“We [opposition] repeatedly assured you [treasury] of smooth business, but the government didn’t allocate even a single penny to our members,” he complained.
Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would participate in the budget debate. He insisted that the provincial government presented the budget against Mr Imran Khan’s will. The chair intervened and claimed that the detained PTI founder had issued directions for the sharing of the budget documents with him after its presentation in the assembly.
He pointed out that had Mr Imran issued orders against announcing the budget, the provincial government would have never violated them.
Also, the house jointly passed a resolution condemning Israeli aggression against Iran.
The resolution, signed by the treasury and opposition members and tabled by MPA Abdul Salam Afridi, read that Israel violated international laws by attacking Pakistan’s neighbouring and brotherly country Iran.
“Israel has been involved in killing countless Muslims in Palestine but the world and the Ummah are just watching them. The Muslim world’s inaction encouraged Israel to attack Iran. This house strongly condemns Israel’s aggression against Iran, stands with Iran and Palestine, and supports all their action for self-defence,” the resolution read.
After the session, member of the opposition PPP Ahmad Karim Kundi complained that the provincial government didn’t share details of budgetary spending from the outgoing fiscal year.
He told reporters that the annual development budget for 2024-25 totaled Rs416 billion but the provincial government hardly spent over Rs150bn out of it.
Mr Kundi insisted that the next budget had no policy for youth.
“The PTI government has always claimed to be focusing on education and healthcare, but the province has 5.5 million children out of school and the major beneficiary of the Health Card scheme is the elite class,” he said.

• Spokesperson terms latest demarcation unjust
ISLAMABAD: At a time when Bahria Town management is facing tough scrutiny by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), it got some relief from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in the illegal land possession case.
The CDA in its new demarcation pointed out that only 181 kanals of land of the civic agency was under illegal possession of Bahria Enclave contrary to the previous report of 2018, which had stated that 510 kanals of CDA land was in its possession.
After the demarcation report of 2018, the CDA had conducted an anti-encroachment operation of a few days and retrieved some land. But the operation was stopped as Bahria had contested the demarcation report.
The new demarcation report dated May 12, 2025, signed by Naib Tehsildar CDA Azhar Mehmood and Naib Tehsildar ICT, pointed out that 181 kanals and 16 marlas of CDA land was in possession of Bahria Enclave, on which the main entry gate, roads, streets, houses and plazas had been developed.
 
 

In 2023, the CDA had stated in the Islamabad High Court that 510 kanals of land had been encroached upon by Bahria Town, but the housing society had contested the civic authority’s statement.
The previous demarcation was conducted in 2018 in the presence of high ranked officials including the deputy commissioner Islamabad, member estate CDA, additional commissioner revenue, assistant commissioners and other relevant officers. The demarcation report was jointly signed by tehsildars of the CDA and ICT revenue department.
However, the new demarcation was conducted by Naib Tehsildar CDA Azhar Mehmood and Naib Tehsildar/Revenue Officer Halqa and their teams.
When contacted, Mr Mehmood, who is now holding acting charge of Tehsildar CDA land and revenue directorate, stated that the demarcation was conducted in accordance with rules and regulations.
He said the CDA’s 181 kanals and 16 marlas of land was in possession of the said society. Asked about the previous demarcation report, Azhar Mehmood said: “After previous demarcation CDA had also retrieved its land. The demarcation conducted by me and our team is purely on merit.”
It is relevant to note here that Bahria Town management is going through a challenging time as NAB had confiscated a number of its properties. However, it got relief from the CDA as a new demarcation report stated only 181 kanals were in its illegal possession.
The Bahria Town management, meanwhile, is still not satisfied.
When contacted, the housing society’s spokesperson, retired Col Khalil, termed the new demarcation unjust. He claimed that the land belonged to Bahria Town but the CDA and Islamabad administration had carried out a wrong demarcation in 2018 while the new one was flawed.
In December 2023, the housing society wrote a letter to the civic body, stating that, “CDA had kindly agreed to consider our request for resolution of land measuring 350 kanals approximately, including roads constructed by Bahria Town, which were being used by residents of Bahria Enclave as well as general public of the area. Moreover, considering the establishment of third party rights in the said land…CDA informed that our request has been considered and will be placed before competent authority for approval of resolution of the issue,” Bahria Town’s letter read.
The letter further pointed out that it had now been learnt that in reply to a writ petition 1780/2023 in the Islamabad High Court, CDA had “erroneously” stated that land measuring 510 kanals had been encroached upon by Bahria Town in Block D of Kuri Model Village.
The society claimed that the information of 510 kanals “was based on CDA’s demarcation conducted in February 2018, whereas a bulk of land has already been taken over by the CDA in year 2021,” the letter further said, claiming that, “presently, 177 kanals of land had been developed by Bahria Town for which payment has been made to land owners, out of which residential-cum-commercial plots have been developed on 39 kanals only,” read the society’s letter which was addressed to CDA in December 2023.

Speaking to Dawn, CPNE President Kazam Khan said the proposed law was an attempt to give legal protection to lavish public money spending for personal publicity. “The proposed law, after enactment, will allow the rulers to use public money for political gains and even launch unelected politicians’ advertisement campaigns,” he observed.
Mr Khan said the proposed law would be in conflict with the Supreme Court decisions and impact the proceedings of cases in courts.
Commenting on the provision of lodging complaint with the Director-General of Public Relations (DGPR) and further appeal before the Punjab information secretary, the CPNE president said how the DGPR, who is the authority to allow launch of any advertisement campaign, can hear a complaint against himself and “decide against his own decision”.
Similarly, he said, the information secretary too was subservient to the political leadership.
“The proposed law embodies classic censorship, stripping citizens of their right to question. Appeals against government campaigns will ironically be adjudicated by government officials themselves – a clear conflict of interest. The implications speak for themselves,” he commented.
 
 

Identifying another anomaly, the CPNE president said the bill proposed to take effect from Jan 1, 2024 when this government was not even formed and suggested covering some period of the caretaker government. “It’s concerning that it prohibits questioning about personal advertisement expenditures. This isn’t just censorship — it’s outright suppression of free speech,” he said.
The bill, tabled by the information minister in the Punjab Assembly on Thursday, was referred to a standing committee for one month, Mr Kazam stated. “The government is poised to enact the bill into law on Monday — after hasty approval by the committee.”
In a shocking display of legislative efficiency, he said, the Punjab information minister revealed that the bill was dispatched to the standing committee for review, “only to be deemed totally in accordance with law and in the interest of public”.

Deputy Commissioner Shahid Ali Khan, upon receiving the information from local residents about illegal mining in the mineral-rich Asil Targaoo area, dispatched a team comprising officials from the district administration, mineral department, and police, which sealed the site after confirming the unlawful activity, said the statement.
The statement issued by the deputy commissioner’s office said that besides sealing the mining site, the team also arrested a person involved in the illegal extraction of minerals.
It said that first information report was lodged against the arrested person, who was shifted to the Memola police station for further legal action.
In the statement, the district administration vowed to protect precious natural resources and not allow anyone to engage in illegal mineral extraction in the district.

A spark fell on the paint and within seconds, the entire godown, along with the chemicals and wooden material, caught fire. Two of the three workers, identified as Ibrar Ali, 35, and Faisal Shahbaz, 20, were severely burnt and died instantly.
The third worker, deceased Ibrar’s elder brother Taimoor Abid, was seriously injured and was shifted to the burn unit of Allied Hospital.
All three workers were residents of the Islam Nagar locality.
NEW BLOCK: It has been decided to build a new emergency block with 150 beds at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (FIC) with the support of a philanthropist.
In the first phase, 50 beds will be added to the new emergency block, where all necessary facilities, including a radiology department and primary angiography, will be available. The number of screening and ECG rooms will also be increased.
Commissioner Maryam Khan visited the FIC on Friday, received a briefing on the steps taken for the construction of the emergency block, and also inspected the site.
The commissioner directed that construction of the new block be started soon after fulfilling all legal requirements, and she also reviewed service delivery and the availability of medicines at the FIC.
FDA: A comprehensive operation by the Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) against illegal housing schemes, encroachments, and unauthorised constructions has been ongoing.
FDA Director General Chaudhry Muhammad Asif told reporters on Friday that, over the last month, teams had conducted 45 operations, demolished structures of seven illegal housing schemes, sealed 28 plots for unauthorised constructions, and cleared permanent encroachments in 10 different areas.
SEALED: Jhang District Council Chief Officer Mehr Muhammad Akram Bharwana directed on Friday the sealing of 10 district council-owned godowns rented to the food department for wheat storage.
He said Rs4.48 million in rent was outstanding, and recently audit paras had been raised by the audit team in this regard.
He said five godowns are in Jhang, three in Shorkot, and two in Shah Jewna.

Chairing a review meeting of all 36 districts on Friday, EOC Coordinator Adeel Tasawur commended the efforts of over 200,000 frontline workers who participated in the recent polio campaign, targeting more than 23 million children across the province.
He announced that Punjab achieved an impressive 99 per cent overall coverage, which he described as a testament to the unwavering commitment of the government, the health department and polio workers.
Despite the success of the drive, Mr Adeel directed all district administrations to closely examine causes of underperformance in certain union councils (UCs) during the recently concluded National Immunization Days (NIDs).
He emphasised that districts must submit comprehensive reports outlining the reasons behind the missed targets.
A special directive was issued for districts to track mobile and migrant families, including those who have relocated outside Punjab, and document their findings in detail to ensure these populations are not left behind in future campaigns.
While acknowledging the improvements made by several districts, Mr Tasawur reiterated the EOC’s zero-tolerance policy on fake data, especially concerning missed children.
He called on all CEOs of the district health authorities (DHAs) to take strict disciplinary action against any officials involved in data manipulation and to formally report such actions to the EOC.
He expressed satisfaction over the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) results, noting that 96pc of UCs passed quality checks, with no council failing—a significant milestone in campaign oversight and monitoring.
Mr Tasawur underscored that finger marking remains the most reliable barometer of vaccination coverage, stressing that every child must be vaccinated and visibly finger-marked. He urged all districts to further improve quality, especially in upcoming rounds of the campaign.
Polio (poliomyelitis) is a highly infectious and potentially crippling viral disease that mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause permanent paralysis and even death in severe cases. While most of the world has successfully eliminated the virus, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only two countries where polio continues to circulate endemically.

• World body says Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has failed in its mission
UNITED NATIONS: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and urging nations to take “all measures necessary” to place pressure on Israel.
Following the United States’ veto of a similar push in the Security Council last week, the General Assembly on Thursday adopted the non-binding resolution by a vote of 149-12, with 19 abstentions.
The text demands “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza, as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners. However, it goes further than the US-vetoed text, taking direct aim at Israel over its impeding aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip.
It “demands that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately end the blockade… and ensure that aid reaches the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip,” which after more than 20 months of war is facing a catastrophic humanitarian situation.
It also calls on all UN members to “individually and collectively take all measures necessary, in line with international law… to ensure compliance by Israel with its obligations.”
Israel’s envoy Danny Danon slammed the resolution in remarks to the press ahead of the vote, saying it is “a farce, is a moral failure, is a political stunt”.
Palestinian Ambas­sador Riyad Mansour, meanwhile, called on all nations to turn their votes “into resolute action”. “No arms, no money, no trade to oppress Palestinians,” he urged.
The resolution adopted “strongly (condemns) any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the unlawful denial of humanitarian access.”
‘GHF has been a failure’
Israel recently ended a total blockade to allow some deliveries to resume through the newly formed, US-backed Gaza Huma­nitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution centres.
The United Nations, which until now has sought to coordinate aid deliveries throughout Gaza, refuses to work with the GHF, citing concerns over its practices and neutrality.
On Friday, the United Nations said the US- and Israeli-backed GHF has been a failure from a humanitarian standpoint of view.
The UN and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
“GHF, I think it’s fair to say, has been, from a principled humanitarian standpoint, a failure,” Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, told a press briefing in Geneva.
“They are not doing what a humanitarian operation should do, which is providing aid to people where they are, in a safe and secure manner. We have the operation ready to roll with food and other supplies ready. We have them in the region, they are pre-cleared by the Israelis.
“We need the borders open to get in and of course we need the safety and security and some resemblance of law and order inside Gaza in order to distribute it,” Laerke said.
An officially private effort with opaque funding and backed by Israel, GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel completely cut off supplies into Gaza for more than two months, sparking warnings of mass famine.
GHF claimed that it had distributed nearly 2.6 million meals on Thurs-day and more than 18.6m to date.
The Palestinian Auth­ority said internet and fixed-line communication services were down in Gaza on Thursday following an attack on the territory’s last fibre optic cable which it blamed on Israel.
“There was and there still is a massive communications blackout,” said Laerke. “If there is no communication it really is damaging” for aid services, he said.
“There is an active effort to try to fix it, of course, and everybody is looking into that, because things kind of ground to a halt when these things happen.”

The two parties also held each other responsible for the economic mess the country was facing.
Opening the budget debate in the House, Leader of the Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz said the government had set wrong priorities of public sector development. He said that while an allocation of Rs135 billion was proposed for water it was Rs227bn for roads. He alleged that it was because it was an easy way to make money.
He said that the proposed federal budget for the next year had become controversial in the beginning as questions were being raised about the apparently fudged economic figures presented in the budget.
“The sanctity of the budget and the numbers in the budget document appear to be compromised,” he said, adding that the budget is a manipulation of figures as serious objections have been raised over it for the first time. He underlined that agriculture contributed 24 per cent to GDP, which was the main driver of the country’s economy.

He noted that the policies of the government had broken the backbone of farmers after the Punjab government abolished the support price of wheat. The other crops have also faced contraction this year as cotton, maize and wheat prices and supply chain are facing disruption and an element of uncertainty has been created in the agriculture sector, he added.
Mr Faraz said that industrial sector had grown at the rate of 7 per cent during the last PTI government, which was now at 4.8 per cent, according to figures provided by the Shehbaz Sharif administration. When large-scale manufacturing is contracting continuously, how is the government showing the growth at 4.8 per cent, he added.
“This gives the impression that the budget figures are manipulated,” he said.
PML-N parliamentary leader Irfan Siddiqui rejected the claim of corruption in road projects and said one can at least see the built roads. He, however, said that it was not possible to see and count trees.
He claimed that it was the PTI regime, which had played havoc with the economy, crushed the law and the Constitution as well as the opposition.
Towards the end of his speech, he urged the government to increase budget for education and prioritise it accordingly.
“It pains me that the budget for education is so insufficient. Likewise, the recurring grant for higher education remains Rs66bn for the last 7-8 years while the development expenditure was Rs70bn in 2023-24 and in 2024-25, it was reduced to Rs66bn and now it has been further cut to Rs39bn. It must be enhanced,” he proposed.
 
 

PPP’s Senator Shahadat Awan in his speech said the budget will fail to bring long-term economic stability. He said according to the World Bank report, 44.796 of Pakistanis, i.e. 107 million people, live below the poverty line and their daily income is less than 1200 rupees and unfortunately, no roadmap has been given in the current budget to reduce this poverty.
“Likewise, in the face of rising inflation, the minimum salary of Rs37,000 that was kept is absolutely low and that is why the PPP has been demanding that this salary be increased to at least Rs50,000 and the federal government ensure that it is implemented in practice in the public and private sectors,” he said.
 
 

He said he was alarmed by this year’s decline of 13.5 per cent in major crops due to certain reasons. Wheat has fallen by 96 per cent but the government’s inaction is making the farmers cry.
“I say that between 2024 and May 2025, the farmers have suffered a loss of Rs2200bn due to which the purchasing power of the landlord has been greatly affected, but it is strange that no forum has been set up for the redressal.
Senator Awan called allocations for health and education pathetic. He said it is very surprising that this year’s budget does not include a single new health project.
Referring to pension issue, he said in this budget, the government has fixed the period of family pension to 10 years after the death of the life partner; This is not justified at all and the government is requested to abolish the two existing standards.

• One black box found from building’s rooftop  • New Delhi-bound flight makes emergency landing in Thailand after bomb threat
AHMEDABAD: The investigation into the Air India plane crash that killed more than 240 people is focusing on the engine, flaps and landing gear, a source said on Friday, as the aviation regulator ordered safety checks on the airline’s entire Boeing-787 fleet.
The Boeing 787-8 Drea­m­liner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height moments after take-off over a residential area of the western city of Ahmedabad and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
Only one passenger survived and local media reported that as many as 24 people on the ground were also killed as the plane crashed onto a medical college hostel during the lunch hour. It was the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
On Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down within moments.
 
 

The probe is also looking at whether Air India was at fault, including on maintenance issues, the source said. A possible bird-hit is not among the key areas of focus, the source said, adding that teams of anti-terrorism experts were part of the investigation process.
The government is considering whether it should ground the Boeing-787 fleet in the country during the probe, the source said. There was no immediate response to requests for comment on that from Air India, Boeing and the aviation ministry.
Air India has more than 30 Dreamliners that include the Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 versions. A source in Air India said there had been no communication so far from the government on the possible grounding.
Separately, India’s aviation regulator ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance actions on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including “one-time check” of the takeoff parameters before the departure of every flight from midnight of June 15.
The airline has also been instructed to introduce ‘flight control inspection’ — checks to ensure control systems are working properly — in transit inspection, and to conduct power assurance checks, meant to verify the engine’s ability to produce the required power, within two weeks.
Black Box found
The aviation ministry said that investigators and rescue workers had recovered the digital flight data recorder — one of the two black boxes on the plane — from the rooftop of the building on which the jet crashed.
There was no information on the cockpit voice recorder, the other black box, which is also crucial to the crash probe.
Indian conglomerate Tata Group took control of the formerly state-owned Air India in 2022, and merged it with Vistara — a joint venture between the group and Singapore Airlines last year.
Investigators from India, the UK and the US have arrived to probe the crash and Tata will be fully transparent about the findings, Tata Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Chandrasekaran said Tata wants to understand what happened, adding, “We don’t know right now”.
Emergency landing
An Air India flight from Phuket bound for New Delhi received an onboard bomb threat on Friday and made an emergency landing back on the Thai island, airport authorities said.
All 156 passengers on flight AI 379 were escorted safely from the plane. No suspicious devices were found, and there was no disruption to airport operations, authorities said.
The incident occurred after a message with a bomb threat was found in one of the plane’s lavatories after takeoff, Phuket Airport general manager Monchai Tanode told a press conference. “Police took suspects for questioning but could not clearly say who wrote the note,” he said.

• PIA re-enters privatisation process, confirms finance minister
• Tax on Google, YouTube services increased from 10pc to 15pc
• 4pc tax on commercial rental income deferred
ISLAMABAD: The National Assem­bly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue has approved an increase in the minimum threshold for daily cash withdrawals, raising it from Rs50,000 to Rs75,000 while rejected a separate proposal to impose an additional 2 per cent sales tax on online purchases, signalling resistance to new digital levies amid growing e-commerce activity.
Chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, the committee also gave its nod to increasing the withholding tax rate on cash withdrawals — from 0.6pc to 0.8pc. However, the committee struck down a parallel proposal to raise the tax from 15pc to 20pc on loan profits earned by banks.
Among other decisions, the committee endorsed the government’s proposal to increase the tax on services provided by digital platforms such as Google and YouTube from 10pc to 15pc. A separate proposal to levy a 4pc tax on rental income from commercial properties, however, was deferred for further deliberation.
The committee also turned down a contentious proposal that would have mandated all sales of Rs200,000 to be conducted through banking channels — a measure critics argued could burden small traders. Meanwhile, it approved an amendment excluding rental income from being adjusted against business losses.
The committee also registered strong opposition to the phased withdrawal of tax exemptions for the former Federally and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (Fata and Pata).
 
 

Terming the move an “economic assassination” of small-scale enterprises in the region, Mr Naveed urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to revisit the decision. He emphasised the need to safeguard livelihoods and stimulate economic recovery in historically underserved areas, directing the FBR to explore avenues for continued fiscal relief tailored to local realities.
A significant time of the committee’s proceedings was consumed by debate over conflicting tax rates proposed for low-income salaried individuals. While Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, in his budget speech, announced a 2.5pc tax rate for annual incomes ranging from Rs600,001 to Rs1.2 million, the Finance Bill 2025 instead reflected a lowered rate of 1pc.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial told the parliamentary committee that the federal cabinet has reversed the proposed tax relief for low-income salaried individuals.
The newly appointed minister of state for finance, Bilal Azhar  Kayani, defended the government’s decision, offering justification for the withdrawal of relief to lower-income salaried individuals. Citing revised estimates, he noted that public sector salaries were raised by 10pc — a significant upward revision from the earlier projection of 6pc.
However, the members observed that the salary bump would benefit only government employees, while the upward tax adjustment would disproportionately impact private sector earners who remain outside the scope of the pay increase.
Mr Qamar voiced concern over the cabinet’s handling of the tax rate increase, questioning the rationale behind approving a higher tax burden on low-income salaried individuals.
FBR transformation plan
Mr Langrial briefed the committee on the FBR transformation plan, whose implementation will start from December.
Some members of the parliamentary committee expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the Faceless Assessment System operational in Karachi, flagging mounting complaints over excessive charges, prolonged processing delays and resultant demurrages.
Lawmakers also raised concerns over the misapplication of the Digital Production Tracking and Digital Invoicing System.
They pointed out persistent errors by the tracking mechanism in differentiating between old, used and scrap materials — an issue they claimed was leading to unwarranted compliance penalties.
In response, the FBR noted ongoing instances where usable goods were allegedly being falsely declared as scrap, suggesting intentional misreporting by some stakeholders.
The FBR chairman informed the parliamentary committee that tax evasion in Pakistan’s cigarette and tobacco sector has reached an alarming Rs295 billion annually.
He said the FBR plans to introduce stricter enforcement mechanisms to curb widespread non-compliance in the industry.
Mr Langrial also highlighted concerns within the cotton and textile sector, noting that sales tax declarations remain significantly underreported.
He also listed several other sectors for low tax payments. He said that there is a tax gap of Rs7.1 trillion in the current fiscal year.
He said that smuggling through the Chagai border in Balochistan remains a major concern, contributing to an estimated Rs500bn in annual revenue losses. He noted tighter enforcement across other border regions and announced plans to introduce a cargo tracking system in the next fiscal year.
To bolster monitoring, digital screening technology will be installed at 22 key Indus River bridges, enabling remote vehicle checks from up to 20 kilometres away. Mr Langrial assured that the system will not hinder legitimate business activity.
Senate committee on finance
Meanwhile, in a separate session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, Finance Minister Aurangzeb briefed members on the economic outlook, budget measures and ongoing global challenges.
He confirmed that the World Bank had approved financing for the Reko Diq project, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) contributing $700 million.
During the meeting, Senators Ahmed and Abdul Qadir from Baloc­histan raised the issue of water scarcity in the province. Senator Ahmed urged the committee that the issue of clean drinking water was even more important than health and education problems.
He demanded the committee complete Kachhi Canal Project in Balochistan, which had been launched 25 years ago.
Mr Aurangzeb told the committee that the budget measures were fully endorsed by the IMF under tax enforcement commitments. He dismissed concerns over hurdles in opening letters of credit, calling such claims “misinformation”.
On privatisation, he acknowledged missed targets but confirmed that Pakistan Inter­na­tional Airlines has re-entered the privatisation process.
Addressing agricultural taxation, he emphasised a shift in narrative — from claims that it could not be imposed to assertions that it it cannot be collected.
“We will collect it — just give us the chance,” he said, adding that provinces will begin agricultural income tax collection from July 1, 2025.
Senators also proposed increasing the retirement age of bureaucrats to ease pension pressures.
In response, Mr Aurangzeb noted that his previous institution had set retirement at 65, and the government would seriously evaluate the idea post-budget.

• 10pc raise for BS-17 to BS-22 officers; 8pc jump in pensions
• Education sector allocation increased to Rs523.7bn
KARACHI: Amid noisy protests by opposition lawmakers, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday presented a deficit budget of Rs3.451 trillion for the fiscal year 2025-26 in the provincial assembly — a 12.9 per cent increase over last year’s budget of Rs3.056tr.
The chief minister announced a 12pc salary increase for provincial government employees in grades BS-1 to BS-16, and a 10pc raise for officers in grades BS-17 to BS-22, alongside an 8pc increase in pensions.
He also revealed that the salaries of Sindh Assembly members would be brought in line with those of legislators in other provinces starting in July.
“We are introducing a Finance Bill that abolishes and reduces certain taxes and levies rather than increasing them,” Mr Shah said.
Taxes that will be abolished include professional tax, entertainment duty, drainage cess, cotton fees and local cess.
The chief minister reiterated that the budget foc­u­ses on education, health, infrastructure and social welfare, along with strategic initiatives to modernise governance and stimulate economic growth.
Budget at a glance
The Sindh government has projected receipts of Rs3.41tr for FY26, marking an 11.6pc increase over the current year.
Transfers from the federal divisible pool, which account for 75pc of total revenue, are estimated at Rs1.927tr, reflecting a 10.2pc rise despite a 5.5pc shortfall in revised estimates for the outgoing year.
Additional federal inflows, including straight transfers and grants to offset the abolition of the OZT (Octroi and Zila Tax), will bring total federal transfers to Rs2.095tr.
Current revenue expenditure is projected at Rs2.149tr, up 12.4pc from Rs1.912tr in the previous year.
The education sector has been allocated Rs523.7bn, up 12.4pc from Rs458.2bn last year — representing 25.3pc of the total current revenue expenditure.
Significant increases are observed across all levels, with the primary education rising from Rs136.2bn to Rs156.2bn.
Resolution against Israel
At the outset of the budget session, tensions flared when Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed declined to allow an MQM-P lawmaker to table a resolution condemning the Israeli attack on Iran.
In protest, MQM-P members stood up, chanted slogans and tore up assembly documents as the chief minister began his speech. They were soon joined by members of the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council, and the opposition collectively rejected the budget, accusing the provincial government of neglect and mismanagement.
Despite the disruption, the chief minister continued with his address and completed the budget presentation as opposition members continued their protest in front of the podium.
During his speech, however, the chief minister condemned the Israeli attack on Iran. Regarding the MQM-P’s insistence on debating the resolution before the budget, Mr Shah clarified that the session had been convened specifically for the budget and that the resolution could be taken up after a brief adjournment.
Following the budget presentation, Mr Shah formally tabled the resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the house. The assembly session was then adjourned until Monday.

• NA’s sound system develops fault ‘due to PTI’s protest’
• Opposition continues to face ‘censorship’ as budget debate begins
ISLAMABAD: A key government minister on Friday announced that a decision to award an unprecedented and massive increase in the salaries and allowances of the National Assembly speaker, Senate chairman and their deputies as well as federal ministers, could be reviewed and potentially even withdrawn in the wake of widespread and ‘somewhat justified’ criticism.
The announcement was made by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on the floor of the National Assembly during a debate on the federal budget, after Speaker Ayaz Sadiq distanced himself from the ongoing controversy, clarifying that neither he nor the finance committee of the house had any role in this decision.
The speaker even declared that he would have no objection, if the decision to increase the salaries was withdrawn.
The speaker gave the “explanation” while interrupting the opening speech of Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan when the latter was about to mention the issue.
“Let me give an explanation. Neither the finance committee [of the house] nor the National Assembly has made this decision. Those who have done so, they can do so,” he said without elaborating, adding that those who could make a decision about the salaries of ministers, speaker or the Senate chairman, could even withdraw it.
“There is no harm, if it [the raise] is withdrawn,” he said. However, the speaker said that the decision to increase the salaries of the members of the parliament had been made by the house finance committee, thus implying that it could not be reversed.
Though, the speaker had not named any individual or institution, the parliamentary affairs minister while mentioning the issue, admitted that it was his ministry which had prepared a summary for the increase in the salaries of the ministers and the custodians of the two houses, stating that the summary was approved by the federal cabinet.
This assertion from the minister came as a surprise for many amid reports that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken a notice of the increase in the salaries and a harsh criticism from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who is also a member of the federal cabinet.
Quoting sources, the media had reported on Friday that the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month, besides huge increase in the allowance bringing the total financial benefit to over Rs2m a month.
However, during the post-budget press conference on June 11, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, Senate chairman and ministers.
The parliamentary affairs minister in his speech declared that since there was a criticism in the “concerned quarters”, therefore, the decision to increase the salaries could be “reviewed and withdrawn”, stating “it is not impracticable.”
After taking the whole responsibility on his shoulder by admitting that his ministry had sent the summary to the federal cabinet for the approval, Dr Chaudhry then stated that altho­ugh there was no big financial impact of the increase in the salaries of the MPs, ministers and the NA speaker and the Senate chairman, the government was ready to “rectify” the decision.
 
 

“Due to the general feelings among the government employees and those [sections of the society] living below the poverty line having no resources and for whom we have not added so much in the budget as our hands are tied, we can try to rectify [the decision] which has sent a bad message and caused a bad taste”, said the minister.
Dr Chaudhry, however, said they had to make this accumulative increase in the salaries as there had been no raise in the salaries of the MPs and the ministers in proportionate to the constant increase in the salaries of the government employees in the previous budgets over the past many years.
Faulty sound system
Earlier, the proceedings of the lower house of the parliament on the opening day of the bud­get debate were marked by disruptions and a controversy when the speaker anno­unced that the microphones and sound system inst­alled on the first four rows of the house were not functioning after developing a technical fault due to the protest of the opposition PTI members during the budget speech of the finance minister on June 10.
The speaker also stated that the repair of the system would cost upto Rs350m.
Interestingly, the opposition members had to come to the opposition leader’s seat to deliver their speeches as the NA Secretariat staff had made special arrangements to provide mic facility to the opposition members.
Initially, the proceedings of the house were not telecast live on the national as well as official social media websites, including YouTube and Facebook, but as soon as the opposition leader finished his speech and the parliamentary affairs minister took the floor, the live transmission of the proceedings began on the official social media channels.

The speeches of the opposition members were completely censored.

The parliamentary reporters also faced difficulties in the coverage of the proceedings as the National Assembly Secretariat staff had removed the speakers placed at the press lounge, besides the transmission was also not available on the screens installed there. The journalists had to sit in the press gallery to take notes of the speeches.
Due to complete censoring of their speeches, some of the opposition members, including Omar Ayub Khan, were seen making videos from their mobile phones during the proceedings.
Budget debate
Most of the speakers from both sides of the aisle delivered political speeches, instead of talking about budgetary measures.
All front treasury benches remained empty most of the time during the opposition leader’s speech in which he harshly criticised the government’s economic policies.
The opposition leader in his speech also talked about the alleged political victimisation of the opposition, and demanded immediate release of the “political prisoners, including Imran Khan.”
Alleging that there was no independent media and judiciary in the country, Mr Khan demanded fresh elections in the country after carrying out some poll reforms.

The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the clandestine nature of the operations, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into an attack that sent oil prices sharply higher on fears of regional escalation.
Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday.
Iran has not given a detailed account of what its Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called “unlawful and cowardly attacks”, but it has promised a harsh response. Iran’s mission at the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s covert operation and other subterfuge related to the attacks.
Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran, briefing journalists that its spy chief would go to Washington before the next negotiations.
Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely civilian.
The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes, which killed the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps among others.
 
 

The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran.
The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.
A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said was the organisation’s operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.
Some of the operation’s components would have taken years to be put together, said Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS).
The decision to strike Iran was made on Monday, the same day Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone, when Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin on Friday, said a second source, an Israeli defence official.
Their discussion was held after the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu, a third official, close to Netanyahu, said.
Press briefings
The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened on Thursday night.
In the days leading up to the strikes, Israel played out a ploy to create the impression an attack was not imminent, according to a fourth source, also an Israeli official.
 
 

False reports suggesting that a rift between Israel and the United States had emerged during Netanyahu and Trump’s phone call on Monday were not denied, the fourth source said.
A press release about a visit by Katz, Zamir and the head of Israel’s Air Force Tomer Bar to an air force base mentioned Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon — but not Iran.
The fourth source said that the ruse included misleading information given in press briefings. As the attack unfolded in the early hours of Friday, some Israeli journalists pointed to one such briefing, according to which Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Mossad Head David Barnea were to be sent to Washington ahead of the next round of nuclear talks on Sunday.
Dermer later appeared seated with Netanyahu at Israel’s defence headquarters bunker in Tel Aviv, in a video distributed by the prime minister’s office.
A fifth, military source said that Israel had been able to surprise Iran but since the operation was not over, there could be “difficult days” ahead.
Iran, which fired ballistic missiles at Israel when they traded blows last year, has promised “harsh punishment” in response to the attack. Israel said it had intercepted many of the 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p><small>2025-06-14 03:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609109-pakistan-strongly-condemns-israels-aggression-against-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan strongly condemns Israel's aggression against Iran</strong></a><br><p>
