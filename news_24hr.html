Rehman was arrested in August at Lahore Airport by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications through his platform. He was granted bail in the case by the Lahore High Court on November 25, but was not released from official custody.
Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman.
In the video uploaded on Sunday, Rehman outlined the timeline of events from his arrest and being remanded into the NCCIA’s custody. He described meeting Chaudhry, alleging that he was verbally and physically abusive.
“He stood up from his chair and verbally abused me,” Rehman alleged. “He asked me, ’Where does your money come from?’ I replied that it comes from YouTube. I have eight million subscribers. He accused me of corrupting the minds of children.
“He kept verbally abusing me and slapped me so much I lost count.”



Rehman further alleged that officials tried to bribe him, offering to resolve the issue for Rs70-80 million, which he said he did not have.
“When I was in NCCIA custody, you probably heard about $326,000 during a podcast with the assistant director. He said that they seized this money from me … the investigating officer ordered me to open my Binance account,” Rehman alleged.
“He closed all my trades and tokens at a loss and converted them to US dollars. He then ordered me to transfer it.”
The YouTuber further accused the IO of transferring the sum to his own personal account.
Rehman said that he felt “very helpless” during the first day of custody, further alleging that he was beaten by authorities despite cooperating with the investigation.
He added that when he met with someone he knew, he asked them to request that the guards “beat him less”.
An NCCIA Lahore spokesperson responded to Dawn’s request for comment on the allegations, replying that it is individuals who engage in corrupt practices, not institutions.
“The NCCIA maintains an uncompromising zero-tolerance policy toward any form of corrupt conduct by its officials,” the spokesperson said.
“All proceedings in this matter are being pursued strictly on merit and in full accordance with due process, and an investigation is already underway with FIA Anti-Corruption,“ he added.
On October 28, six NCCIA personnel were arrested and remanded on allegations of misusing their authority and taking bribes.
Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery” and would be produced in district court, where he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six staffers were Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered against nine people, including eight NCCIA personnel, with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Rehman’s wife, Aroob Jatoi.</p><small>2025-12-07 19:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08002339a453d59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959765/national-games-system-overpowers-spirit-in-basketball' target='_blank'><strong>National Games: System overpowers spirit in basketball</strong></a><br><p>Just four days before the National Games basketball event was set to tip-off, the Pakistan Basketball Federation (PBBF) was told the venue was gone. With teams arriving and no court to play on, the event itself was in jeopardy.
“We arranged everything in almost two days,” PBBF secretary Yaqoob Qadri told Dawn, revealing a significant off-court challenge. “There were some people who don’t want the event to happen.”
Yet, on Sunday, the roar of a packed crowd for the Army-Sindh clash at the North Nazimabad Gymkhana in Karachi was the definitive answer. Against a backdrop of administrative hurdles, the players delivered a classic on the hardwood: a tale of Army’s clinical system slowly dismantling Sindh’s passionate home stand, culminating in a 97-62 victory.
The roar in the arena was for Sindh. Every steal, every basket by the home team sent waves of noise crashing onto the court. But standing across from that passion was the cold, tall geometry of the Pakistan Army team. What unfolded was a classic clash of heart versus system.
The start was all Sindh. Feeding off the overwhelming home support, they edged a tight first quarter 6-4. Army’s towering presence, anchored by the 7’3“ frame of Taglub Ammar, was a problem.
“We took our competition lightly that’s why Sindh edged us in the first quarter,” Taglub admitted to Dawn.
Army’s top-scorer Shiraz Aslam, who initially missed some of his three-point shots struggled in start found his rhythm.
Sindh’s in-game leader, Ans Azhar, pinpointed the turning point.
“In the first quarter we started brilliantly and I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” he told Dawn. “In the second quarter when that wave passed we couldn’t keep the same intensity and that’s where they hurt us.”
That hurt was methodical. Army began dominating the second balls, converting rebounds into points and punishing every seldom mistake.
The tall player was no longer just a threat; he became the central piece of an unsolvable equation.
“We were to some extent not able to overpower them in some exchanges,” Ans conceded. “I wouldn’t say that it was a total mismatch but Army’s athletes are fittest of our country.”
By halftime, Army led 15-12. By the third quarter, the lead had swelled to 20. The crowd, still raising the roof, willed a comeback, but Army had locked in.
“We came prepared and were always confident of the comeback,” Shiraz said, who revelled in the electric atmosphere. “This is what we play for… The atmosphere today made the match very exciting.”
The final quarter was a formality, the gap insurmountable. Sindh’s physical effort, which saw them “commit too many fouls” and give away nearly 20 points from the line, was a testament to their fight.
“Against a team like Army you can’t shy away from those duels,” Ans stated. “We were very physical in the game… you play to win no matter what.”
Despite the loss, Sindh’s leader found perspective and promise.
“Obviously wasn’t the result we wanted… but we are still a work in progress,” Ans said, already looking ahead. “But one thing that I can ensure is that it will be improved and [we will] beat those professional sides at the top level with the same bunch.”
A theme of dominance
The men’s result echoed through the women’s bracket, where professional department teams showcased their structural advantage. The Army women routed Balochistan 56-6, while Wapda, the most dominant force in women’s basketball, cruised past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
For Wapda’s Kainat Zafar, the win was a controlled step towards the gold.
“We were trying to conserve our energy and avoid injuries,” she explained while talking to Dawn. “We tried to stick to the basics.”
She credits their dynasty to chemistry built over years together as a department — a key edge over provincial sides.
“The chemistry among the players is what I think keeps us on the top,” she said.
Yet, even in dominance, there’s respect. “Our main rivals are always Army,” Kainat noted, setting the stage for the tournament’s likely climax.</p><small>2025-12-07 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07235448368f26d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959764/israels-netanyahu-to-discuss-second-phase-of-gaza-plan-with-trump-later-this-month' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu to discuss second phase of Gaza plan with Trump later this month</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the second phase of a US plan to end Tel Aviv’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed.
Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold important discussions with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan’s second phase was achieved.
The prime minister’s office in November said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”, although a date for the visit has not yet been made public.
Netanyahu said that he would discuss with Trump how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. Israel and Hamas entered a ceasefire two months ago, but Israel has continued its bombardment of Gaza, killing Palestinians, as the death toll in the besieged enclave reached over 72,300 as of November 19, 2o25. Gaza’s health ministry says 373 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire started. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by Hamas.
Earlier today, Israel’s army killed seven Palestinians in northern Gaza, including a 70-year-old woman and her son. Attacks also wounded a child in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera. Tel Aviv also alleges that Hamas has been violating the ceasefire.
Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on “their commitment” to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.
Israel retained control of 53 per cent of Gaza under the first phase of Trump’s plan, which involved the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel. The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023, fighting Hamas.
Phase 2 must come out now: German chancellor
According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established in Gaza and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.
A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled.
“What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” Netanyahu said, describing them as central issues.
Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute, but that phase two “must come now”.
West Bank annexation remains subject of discussion: Netanyahu
Netanyahu said that he would also discuss with Trump “opportunities for peace”, an apparent reference to US efforts for Israel to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states.
“We believe there’s a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours,” Netanyahu said, asserting Israel would always insist on security control of the West Bank.
Trump has said he promised Muslim leaders that Israel would not annex the occupied West Bank, where Netanyahu’s government is backing the development of Jewish settlements.
The “question of political annexation” of the West Bank remains a subject of discussion, Netanyahu said.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0718360742a870d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959752/45-arrested-as-citizens-clash-with-police-during-sindh-culture-day-rally' target='_blank'><strong>45 arrested as citizens clash with police during Sindh Culture Day rally</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling.
“We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.”
The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters.
He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing.



Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
“In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations.
“Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.”
Later, the DIG said that 12 of the 45 arrested were released on the surety of the Karachi Bar Association president.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office.
In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.”







Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.



Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered.
Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge.
“Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

Their goldrush on Sunday was spearheaded by utter dominance in taekwondo and sharp shooting on the ranges.
The clearest demonstration of authority came in the taekwondo Poomsae events, where Army fighters ruled the roost, clinching eight gold medals across age categories.
Their women set the tone: Sana Sabir (Under-50), Naila (U-30), Mehar-Un-Nisa (U-40) and Zeena Sheraz (Under-20)  all stood atop the podium. The men followed suit with Adil Hussain (U-30), Mohammad Mumtaz (U-40), Irshad Ali (U-50) and Syed Zohaib (U-20) securing their own golds.
On the shooting ranges, Army and Navy engaged in a high-class duel, sharing three gold medals apiece.
Navy swept the 10m air pistol events, with Rabia Kabir (232.2) edging Army’s Rimsha Nadeem (231.6) for individual glory before teaming with Rasam Gul and Hadia Liaquat for team gold.
Army struck back in the 25m rapid fire pistol through Mohammad Shabbir while Navy’s G. M. Bashir, Maqbool Hussain and Abdul Quddus took the team title.
Army also claimed both skeet Olympic titles, with Imam Haroon (score 49) leading the charge.
Sindh’s first gold
The day’s most dramatic narrative unfolded away from the established powers, as the Sindh women’s netball team rose above a feisty, fractious final to secure a domineering 20-12 victory over favourites Wapda, claiming a statement gold — a first for the contingent.
It was a triumph of provincial grit over a departmental side with year-round training access.
“That makes this even better,” Sindh skipper Quratulain told Dawn. Team-mate Huma echoed the hunger for more support: “We’ll go a long way if we get that opportunity.”
The match itself descended into chaos. After Sindh seized a 13-9 half-time lead, the stifling heat seemed to boil over.
A third-quarter collision escalated into a shoving match. In the final quarter, a Wapda player made an expletive gesture, inciting the crowd. Sindh held their nerve, but sportsmanship evaporated at the final buzzer.
Handshakes were skipped, and an hour later, a sullen Wapda and bronze-winning Army drowned out Sindh’s celebrations with chants of “losers, losers!”
“The girls need their own court,” said Sindh coach Humaira Huma, a pioneer of Pakistan’s first national team. “Today was just a month’s practice. Imagine what they could do.”
In stark contrast, the men’s final was a pure sporting contest, with Army staging a last-gasp comeback to clinch gold 27-26 against Navy.
Hosts overwhelmed
On the basketball court, Army’s men showcased their systemic power, overcoming a raucous home crowd to dismantle Sindh 97-62.
Sindh started strong, leading 6-4 early. “We started brilliantly, but I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” Sindh’s leader Ans Azhar told Dawn.
Army’s towering 7’3“ center, Taglub Ammar, proved unsolvable. “We took the competition lightly initially,” Taglub conceded. Once settled, Army took control, leading 15-12 at halftime and stretching it to 20 by the final quarter.
Top-scorer Shiraz Aslam revelled in the atmosphere: “This is what we play for… The crowd made the match very exciting.”
Sindh’s physicality cost them nearly 20 points from free throws.
“We were very physical… you play to win,” said Ans, who vowed improvement: “We will beat those professional sides.”
In women’s basketball, the powerhouses marched on.
Army delivered a merciless 56-6 rout of Balochistan while Wapda, led by Kainat Zafar, powered past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
“We were trying to conserve energy and avoid injuries,” said Kainat, highlighting Wapda’s key advantage. “This chemistry is the advantage we have over provincial teams.”
Crushing win
Other sports saw their opening salvos. In a staggering display, Wapda’s women’s hockey team crushed Balochistan 18-0, with ten players on the scoresheet.
On the badminton courts, stars like Mahoor Shahzad (Wapda) and Palwasha Bashir (Sindh) led their teams comfortably into the semi-finals.
Army and Punjab also ensured progress with dominant wins.
Murad Ali (KP), Pakistan’s number one, led his team into the last-four in the men’s section as his side beat Railways to advance in the semis.
Army and Police also confirmed their berths in the next round.
The fencing mat witnessed a historic gold for the Higher Education Commission (HEC), delivered by Abdul Mussawir, who dashed Balochistan’s title hopes in the final.
Other sports that kicked off on Sunday included, rugby, volleyball, baseball, softball and table tennis.
Action continues across Karachi on Monday, with Army’s golden machine looking to build on a formidable lead, and provincial sides like Sindh aiming to channel their fighting spirit into more podium finishes.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0722580207891a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959760/transporters-press-ahead-with-wheel-jam-strike-in-islamabad-rawalpindi-tomorrow-despite-administrations-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters press ahead with wheel-jam strike in Islamabad, Rawalpindi tomorrow despite administration’s appeal</strong></a><br><p>Local public transporters on Sunday announced a wheel-jam strike for tomorrow (December 8) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, rejecting the local administration’s request to delay the protest against the new traffic ordinance, which has raised fines for heavy vehicles.
The strike was announced on the call of the Punjab Public Transport Association. Before the announcement, representatives of the association, along with the Goods Transporters Association, met City Traffic Police officer Farhan Aslam and Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi. The administration urged transporters not to observe a wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
However, local transporters refused to withdraw their decision, insisting they would go ahead with the strike to pressure the provincial government into repealing the ordinance.
“We tried to convince the transporters not to go for a wheel-jam strike, but they demanded to abolish the new amendments, and it was beyond our authority to do anything about it,” Shirazi said.
He added that the Punjab government had been informed of the demands of the transporters, and it would hold negotiations with the United Transport Association in Lahore.
Mutahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairman Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that “transporters were facing problems due to heavy fines, and it was difficult to manage their household budgets.”
“Heavy fines from Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 had become routine, and it destroyed their business,” Riaz said, adding that the government was trying to recover its financial burdens from transporters, who were already struggling with fuel and spare parts.
He demanded an immediate reduction in fines and an end to policies that “destroyed the sector.”
During the meeting, he said that the traffic police agreed not to impose fines on vehicles having a fitness certificate.
Meanwhile, the President of the Goods Transport Association, Shakeel Qureshi, said that freight vehicles and goods transporters in Rawalpindi would support the wheel-jam strike on Monday.
“We will join them in the decision of the Pakistan United Transporters Committee to strike on December 8,” he said, adding that the Rawalpindi transporters will keep their bases completely closed.
“We strongly condemn the traffic laws passed by the Punjab Assembly and the rate of fines,” he said. “Amendments to the customs laws that will be made are tantamount to economic murder of transporters.”
Qureshi went on to say that the government should take the time to be conscious and make decisions, keeping in mind the interests of the people. “It should not be that decisions are made by listening to one side and making laws without consulting stakeholders,” he said.
On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) Rawalpindi district has announced its full support for the December 8 strike of the Transport Action Committee against heavy traffic fines.
Spokesperson JUI Rawalpindi Hafiz Ziaullah said that heavy fines imposed by the Punjab government have made life difficult for the people of Rawalpindi, especially the poor motorcyclists.
He demanded that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, “adopt a people-friendly policy and reduce the unnecessary and unfair burden of fines.”</p><small>2025-12-07 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07222639a82bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959758/un-calls-on-taliban-to-lift-ban-on-afghan-women-in-its-offices' target='_blank'><strong>UN calls on Taliban to lift ban on Afghan women in its offices</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations called on the Taliban authorities on Sunday to lift its ban on Afghan women working in its offices, saying the restriction puts “life-saving services” at risk.
Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, Afghan women have been barred from doing most jobs, visiting parks and beauty salons, and attending school beyond the age of 12.
In September, the Taliban authorities began prohibiting women staff members from entering UN offices.
“We call for the ban on Afghan women staff and contractors from entering United Nations premises to be reversed, and for their safe access to offices and the field,” Susan Ferguson, the special representative of the UN’s women’s agency in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“The longer these restrictions remain in place, the greater the risk to these life-saving services,” Ferguson said, adding that they violated the UN’s principles of human rights and equality.
The statement did not say how many staff were affected, but UN sources indicated that several hundred women were facing the ban.
Staff have been working remotely for the past three months, notably assisting the victims of deadly earthquakes and Afghan migrants deported from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, Ferguson said.
Describing their work as “indispensable”, she said: “Only through their presence can we reach women and girls safely and provide culturally appropriate assistance.”
The Taliban authorities did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
In September, the UN’s refugee agency suspended cash aid to returned Afghan migrants, citing the impossibility of interviewing and collecting information on more than 50 per cent of returnees who were women.</p><small>2025-12-07 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/072023361df514e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959755/pti-says-attempts-to-malign-imran-will-only-increase-his-popularity' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says attempts to malign Imran will only increase his popularity</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Sunday stated that “further attempts to malign” party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in a bid to diminish his popularity would only cause his popularity to rise with each narrative orchestrated against him.
The party presented its stance during a rally held at Peshawar’s Sports Complex, where its leadership was joined by its political ally, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Both parties expressed their solidarity with Imran as they took exception to the recent remarks made against him, urging that “those responsible be held to account” to prevent similar remarks in future.
Speaking to the participants of the rally, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that undemocratic elements were apprehensive of the struggle of genuine political movements like the TTAP and PTI, prompting them to resort to using “improper language”.
“Pakistan is our country, and we will make all efforts to save it from disintegration,” Achakzai said, adding his party and its allies wanted a Pakistan “where no one harms others, where people with different schools of thought could live together peacefully, and this country moves forward with constitutional supremacy and rule of law”.
He also warned against a governor’s rule in KP, saying that such a move would lead to negative consequences.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, while addressing the rally, said that the PTI was not responsible if peace had not returned in the region due to the state’s security policies.
He added that since taking the oath as chief minister, he fulfilled all legal and constitutional obligations, but a different narrative was being built up against him, and elements were trying to show the world that PTI has adopted confrontational politics.
A resolution passed during the rally stated, “We, the people of Pakistan, consider Imran Khan a national hero and the elected and genuine prime minister of Pakistan, who was elected by the people on February 8, 2024. We categorically reject that he or his associates are in any way a threat to national security.”
The resolution, moved by PTI MNA Sher Ali Arbab, stated that the party recorded its strong protest against the recent remarks against Imran.
It said that such a language against a political leader was “against the principles of civil supremacy of Quaid-i-Azam”.
The PTI also condemned how those with dissenting political opinions were called “a growing threat to national security”.
Their statement came in reference to a press conference held on Friday by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, during which he assailed the incarcerated PTI founder for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The party announced another rally in Kohat on December 14.
Political figures assail PTI, Imran for ‘anti-army rhetoric’
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, meanwhile, took to X and assailed the PTI founder, stating that it is justified to call any individual “delusional” or “mentally ill” if they target the state in pursuit of political interests.
“Behind the response given in the DG ISPR’s press conference lies the incessant hate-mongering rhetoric of that person and his followers, for which there is no parallel in Pakistan’s history,” the post read.
Asif also condemned the PTI’s attempt to create divisions between the armed forces and their leadership and stated that “no effort contrary to the country’s dignity, sovereignty, and national security” would be allowed to succeed.
“The criminal sitting in Adiala cannot be permitted under any circumstances to toy with the country’s stability,” he wrote.







Earlier today, several political figures belonging to different parties — including PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal and Hanif Abbasi, PPP’s Sarfaraz Bugti, and the leadership of MQM-P — showed solidarity with the armed forces of Pakistan. They slammed Imran and the PTI for spreading propaganda against the armed forces and attempting to hatch an alleged conspiracy against the country.
“Political differences are part of any democracy—but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and unity of the country,” Iqbal wrote on X.
MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said the PTI was continuing its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it was “creating political instability in the country.”
Bugti, addressing a press briefing, said that Imran was “spreading propaganda against the armed forces and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies,” calling it “an intelligence-driven war against Pakistan”.

Red Bull’s Verstappen, who ended the campaign with more wins (eight) than any driver, triumphed in the season-ender with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri second and 12.5 seconds behind at the chequered flag.
Norris, Britain’s 11th Formula One world champion, took his points tally to 423 with Verstappen on 421 and Piastri third with 410.

McLaren, who secured the constructors’ championship in October for the second year in a row, won both titles in the same season for the first time since 1998.
“I’ve not cried in a while. I didn’t think I would cry but I did,” said an emotional Norris in a post-race interview, after also shedding tears inside his helmet.

“It feels amazing. I now know what Max feels like a little bit.

“I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It’s been a pleasure to race against both of them. It’s been an honour, I’ve learned a lot from both,” he added.
Norris’s mother Cisca gave Piastri a consoling hug while both Verstappen and the Australian congratulated the new champion in a show of sportsmanship.
The victory denied Verstappen the achievement of five titles in a row, something only Ferrari great Michael Schumacher has managed so far.
Charles Leclerc finished fourth in Sunday’s race for Ferrari with George Russell fifth for Mercedes and Fernando Alonso sixth for Aston Martin.
Esteban Ocon was seventh for Haas, ahead of Ferrari’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton – who failed to stand on the podium all year in a career low for the 40-year-old who joined the Italian team this year from Mercedes.

A day earlier, the PTI had lashed out at a press briefing by the military’s media wing, calling it “inappropriate and unfortunate” after the spokesperson accused incarcerated Imran Khan of being a “narcissist” and a “mentally ill person” who was edging into “security threat” territory through his persistent anti-army rhetoric.
Taking to the X platform, PML-N leader and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called Imran’s political rhetoric “a deeply irresponsible and dangerous trend that seeks to undermine Pakistan’s state institutions, weaken national cohesion, and erode public trust in the armed forces who defend our borders with courage and sacrifice.”
“Political differences are part of any democracy—but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and unity of the country,” he wrote.
Iqbal added that no leader had the right to weaponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security.
“The Pakistan Army is a professional, disciplined, and patriotic institution that has stood as the shield of this nation, from fighting terrorism to defending territorial sovereignty.
“Attempting to malign the armed forces or create discord between the people and their defenders serves only the agenda of Pakistan’s enemies,” he said, adding that he “strongly condemned Imran’s “continued politics of hate, distortion, and incitement against the state and state institutions.”



‘Another conspiracy against Pakistan?’ — MQM-P
The leadership of Muttah­ida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) also called out the PTI for “deviating from a political route and resorting to the politics of the streets to cause instability in the country”.
“The PTI has continued its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it used it to create political instability in the country,” MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said during a press conference in Karachi.“During this time, when all parliamentarians on both sides of the spectrum should have stood with the armed forces, the leadership of the armed forces, and the political leadership of the country, a campaign was instead initiated over the last two days, giving way to fears that there might be some foreign elements involved in all of this,” he said.
Siddiqui went on to say that all political parties could have different viewpoints and even different dreams for Pakistan’s future, “but whenever the country found itself in crisis, all political parties are seen to be standing together.”
“Even when PTI needed us, all political parties, including us, stood with them. Did we ever say we would not speak to political forces despite being part of the political force ourselves?” he questioned.
He continued: “So, I would also expect from the government that the anti-Pakistan rhetoric, and the campaign which is being led from outside Pakistan, should be carefully observed. Is this creating grounds for another conspiracy against Pakistan?”
He said that MQM-P, for the sake of Pakistan’s dignity, honour, respect, and prosperity, invites all political parties to come and sit together and talk about it.
“It is indeed the responsibility of all parties that if anyone is working against the interest of Pakistan, we should not only identify it, but also take action against it.
“Today, there is democracy in Pakistan, so democratic forces should together tackle those who, under the guise of democracy, are harming Pakistan owing to their ego or at someone’s direction. There is a need for a joint, united struggle against all such attempts.”
‘Propaganda against armed forces in line with hostile agencies’ agenda’: — Bugti
Balochistan Chief Minister and PPP leader Sarfaraz Bugti also assailed Imran for “spreading propaganda against the army and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies.”
Speaking during a press conference in Islamabad, he said that today, the nation needed to stand with its security forces more than ever before, as two provinces were facing a serious insurgency.
“In this situation, the nation has to choose, and the nation has chosen to stand with its forces. I can tell you about Balochistan, that the people of Balochistan have been with their forces, they are with the forces, and will be with the forces,” he asserted, adding that there was an urgent need to “abandon the narrative which was weakening the state.”
Referring to Imran, he said, “The popular leader you talk about, his kids are in London and on the other hand, every single day, people’s sons in the Pakistan Army — the captains, the majors, and the colonels are sacrificing their lives for the sake of the country’s security and for our future.
“Spreading propaganda against them and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies … this is an intelligence-driven war against Pakistan. Why are we becoming part of it? Our state should always be above our politics. Because if there is no state, there will be nothing.”
‘Had you listened to me then, we would not have anarchy, terrorism’: Hanif Abbasi
Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi assailed Imran during a press conference in Rawalpindi, calling him a “threat to national security” and stating that had his claims about the ex-premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now.
“I filed a case against you,” Abbasi said, addressing the PTI founder and referring to a legal case about the PTI receiving foreign funding and “compromising” patriotism.
“I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.”
Echoing the words of Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the railways minister called Imran a “mental patient” and slammed him for a social media post against the armed forces. He also assailed Imran’s family for giving interviews to Afghan and Indian media.
“His children appear on Afghan media, his sisters appear on Indian media. What’s going on here?” Abbasi asked. “You (Imran) have not been punished or mistreated. You cannot handle jail, and you’re threatening national security.”
The minister added that Imran’s post targeted an entire institution rather than one person and added that since becoming an atomic power, Pakistan’s institutions have been targeted by foreign states.
“If you were only against one person, you’d pray for martyrs, you would not say that MNAs going into NDU (National Defence University) are traitors because they met officers,” Abbasi stated.
He then turned his attention to Imran’s sisters, who appeared on Indian media outlets to give interviews and were the target of criticism by the government for “defaming Pakistan”.
The minister stated that the PTI founder’s sisters “said that the whole of India is crying for Imran Khan” and slammed them for “worshipping” the powers that be.
“If they meet you, then all is good, but if they don’t, then you are ready to threaten our nation’s security,” Abbasi said.“Your true face has been exposed in front of the world — you targeted your heroes,” he added. “If you are against one person, that’s fine, but you targeted monuments to martyrs, GHQ, Corps Commander House. You did what our enemies hoped to achieve.““My point is that I cannot understand how someone who plays with our national security is a Pakistani. They can be a traitor or a mental patient, but not a Pakistani.”
‘Imran always stood firm for country’: PTI
Reacting to Abbasi’s presser, PTI, in a statement, said that “it would be difficult for individuals like Abbasi to understand that Imran always stood firm for his country, its institutions, and the people of Pakistan at every forum.”“Imran Khan was the one who achieved diplomatic, military and narrative advantage over India and defended Pakistan’s stance at the global stage,” the statement said, adding that Imran strengthened the credibility of national institutions.
“However government was trying to portray that every dissenting voice was against the state,” the statement added.
Replying to allegations related to India and the Indian media, the PTI alleged that “Pakistan’s history was quite clear that the Sharif family had business dealings with Indian businessmen and personal relations with Narendra Modi.”
The statement further claimed that Imran’s only “crime” was that he was “the most popular leader struggling for genuine freedom.”
‘Politically charged’ press conference
During PTI’s Saturday press conference at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan said it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, after the DG ISPR called Imran “a mental patient“ for his constant anti-army rhetoric.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that whenever the PTI founder posted something on social media against the army chief, Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral.
“The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he (Imran) is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public,” the DG ISPR said.
In response, Gohar said that “ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction, adding there was still time for tone to be eased and for steps to improve the current situation.”
The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. He added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but the ISPR chief’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”.
On the other hand, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Imran was not a national security threat, but he had kept the people united.
“Do not drive away the people of Pakistan; they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI,” he said, adding that there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united.”
He termed the ISPR DG’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder.
“Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”</p><small>2025-12-07 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637936-three-women-found-dead-inside-home-in-karachis-gulshan-e-iqbal' target='_blank'><strong>Three women found dead inside home in Karachi's Gulshan-e-Iqbal</strong></a><br><p>

According to the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was conducted on Saturday on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement detailed that during the operation yesterday, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 12 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were found in the terrorists’ possession, it said, adding that they had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area as [a] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision [of] ‘Azm-i- Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Yesterday, a statement issued by the ISPR had said that 14 terrorists had been killed in three separate intelligence-based IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Balochistan’s Tank.
Earlier this week, security forces had killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.
President, PM laud forces for successful operation in Kalat
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Kalat, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president, in his statement, said the state of Pakistan was “fully capable of taking enemies of peace to their end at all costs.”
He reiterated that the “resolve of the nation will foil every conspiracy of Fitna al Hindustan.”
In his statement, PM Shehbaz said security forces were “achieving great successes against terrorism under the vision of Azm-e-Istehkam.”
“The nation is united against terrorism and is determined to completely eradicate all forms of this menace from the country,” the report quoted him as saying.

According to a letter dated November 26 and addressed to Barrister Gohar, which is seen by Dawn, the PTI leader had written an application to the commission on November 13 regarding the inclusion of senators into the PTI.
While the letter did not elaborate on the matter raised by Barrister Gohar, he seemed to have sought the inclusion of those senators into his party who were elected to the upper house of Parliament from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in July after much delay.
The ECP said in its letter that “after due deliberation, it was observed that the issue of intra-party election of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is pending before the commission due to the stay order obtained by the party from the Lahore High Court (LHC)”.
“Hence, in the above circumstances, the commission is not in a position to accept you as chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. Therefore, you do not have any locus standi, and you are informed, accordingly,” the letter read.
The PTI has held intra-party elections three times, but the initial two were voided by the commission. Following the third election, the PTI approached the LHC, which restrained the commission from issuing any final order in proceedings related to the intra-party polls.
On Saturday, Barrister Gohar also addressed the matter during a press conference, recalling that the last intra-party election of the PTI was held on March 3, 2024.
“We filed documentation pertaining to it, but there was no [confirmation of] acceptance by the election commission. Today, for the first time, I received the election commission’s letter in which they formally said that ‘we do not recognise you’. It is very unfortunate that they do not recognise the PTI,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-07 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637893-fo-rebuffs-indian-fms-highly-inflammatory-baseless-remarks-against-pakistan-army' target='_blank'><strong>FO rebuffs Indian FM's 'highly inflammatory, baseless remarks' against Pakistan Army</strong></a><br><p>

The FO’s condemnation came a day after Jaishankar alleged that India’s core challenges with its neighbouring country stemmed directly from Pakistan’s military establishment.
In its reaction to his remarks, the FO underscored that Pakistan was a responsible state, and all its institutions, including armed forces, were a pillar of national security, dedicated to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.







The FO’s statement also referred to a brief four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May, saying that it “vividly demonstrated Pakistan armed forces’ professionalism as well as their resolve to defend the motherland and the people of Pakistan against any Indian aggression in a befitting, effective yet responsible manner”.
“No amount of propaganda can belie this truth,” the statement added.
It labelled attempts by the Indian leadership to defame Pakistan’s state institutions and its leadership as “part of a propaganda campaign designed to distract attention from India’s destabilising actions in the region and beyond, as well as state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan”.
“Such incendiary rhetoric only exemplifies the extent of India’s disregard for amity, peace and stability in our region.”
The statement said that instead of making misleading remarks about the armed forces of Pakistan, “India must investigate the fascist and revisionist Hindutva ideology that has unleashed a reign of mob justice, lynchings, arbitrary detentions and demolition of properties and places of worship”.
Indian state and leadership both had become “hostage of this terror in the name of religion,” it added.
The statement further stressed that “Pakistan believes in co-existence, dialogue and diplomacy. However, it stands united and resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its interests and sovereignty”.</p><small>2025-12-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071431438ed8305.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959746/pakistan-to-sell-excess-gas-in-international-markets-from-january-1-petroleum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to sell excess gas in international markets from January 1: petroleum minister</strong></a><br><p>Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said on Sunday that Pakistan would begin selling excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) in international markets from January 1.
Malik’s statement during a press conference in Lahore came months after it was reported that Pakistan was exploring ways to sell excess LNG cargoes amid a gas supply glut that could cost domestic producers millions in annual losses.
He noted that Pakistan had been importing gas from “our friend” Qatar and Italian energy company Eni. But, he continued, there was an excess of this imported gas as the use of this fuel for power generation had reduced in the country during the past few months.
Resultantly, “we were compelled to divert it to domestic consumers, due to which circular debt was increasing in the gas sector”, he said, adding that it also caused a loss of around Rs1,000 billion to Pakistan from 2018-19 till now.
“From January 1, we will sell this excess fuel in international markets and reduce our burden while limiting the loss caused by it,” he added.
Moreover, he said, the measure would also allow Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises in the sector to operate on their full capacity and generate profit.
Last month, it was reported that Pakistan had struck a deal to cancel 21 LNG cargoes under its long-term contract with Eni as part of a plan to curb excess imports that have flooded its gas network. Meanwhile, sources also said that Pakistan was in talks with Qatar about gas supplies from the Gulf state, with options including deferring some cargoes or reselling them under existing contract clauses.
Foreign investment
During his press conference, Malik also outlined the expected investment in the petroleum sector by foreign companies.
He recalled that Turkiye’s energy minister had visited Pakistan recently and “after 20 years, Turkish Petroleum, in collaboration with Pakistani companies”, would be taking part in onshore and offshore exploration activities.
“Turkish Petroleum will also open its office in Islamabad, where 10 to 15 Turkish nationals will be working,” he said, adding that Pakistanis would also get employment there.
“We are moving towards decreasing our reliance on imported oil and gas,” the minister further stated.
He said a delegation of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) would be visiting Pakistan in the coming week, adding that it was also expected to collaborate with local companies for oil and gas exploration.
The minister said SOCAR was also opening its office in Pakistan. “It will also invest millions of dollars in the construction of an oil pipeline from Machike to Thalian in collaboration with the PSO (Pakistan State Oil) and FWO (Frontier Works Organisation).”
He said the pipeline’s construction would begin in a month or month and a half.
Malik said private fundraising of $3.5 billion for the Reko Diq project had been finalised, and now the banks were finalising the agreements. In addition, he said, local companies and Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold would invest more than $3.5bn in the project.
In total, $6-7bn would be invested in the first phase of the project, following which “you will see the face of Chaghi (the site of the project) changing”, he added.
The minister said Reko Diq’s signing ceremony was expected to take place in a month or two at the Prime Minister’s House.

A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has battered Southeast and South Asia, setting off landslides, flooding vast tracts and cutting off communities from Sumatra island’s rainforests to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka.
At least 1,812 people have been killed in the natural disasters rolling across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past two weeks.
Indonesia’s president on Sunday vowed to step up aid, with demonstrators rallying after the country’s death toll surpassed 900.
More than two million people in Sri Lanka — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by last week’s floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century.
The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said monsoon storms were adding more rain and making hillsides unstable, including in the central mountainous region and the north-western midlands.
Helicopters and planes were being used on Sunday to supply communities cut off by landslides in the centre of the country.
The Sri Lanka Air Force said it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar on Sunday, the latest batch of foreign aid.
The government has confirmed 618 dead — 464 from the lush tea-growing central region — while 209 people remain unaccounted for.
The number of people in state-run camps had dropped to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as floodwaters receded across the island by Sunday, the DMC said.
More than 75,000 homes were damaged, including close to 5,000 that were completely destroyed, it added.
‘Disaster tourism’
In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday flew back to Sumatra’s hard-hit Aceh province, with a ministry saying his visit was “to ensure the acceleration of emergency response and recovery in affected areas”.
The Indonesian government has so far shrugged off calls to declare a national disaster, which would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response. The toll in Indonesia on Sunday remained at 916 dead, with 274 still missing.

 

Prabowo will also “monitor the distribution of aid, the evacuation process of residents, and measures to reopen road access,” the Ministry of the State Secretariat said.
“The government emphasises that the handling of the floods in Aceh is a national priority and all resources are being mobilised to expedite the recovery of community conditions,” it added in a statement.
Speaking shortly after arriving in the capital Banda Aceh, Prabowo promised that “we will put all our efforts into this, and later we will repair all the bridges, hopefully within one or two weeks”.
Many survivors said their greatest need remained clean drinking water.
Some victims accused the Indonesian leader and other officials of engaging in “disaster tourism” and failing to address the crisis.
“We see that, including Prabowo’s visit in Bireuen today, it seems like a disaster tourism trip,” said Syahrul, a 35-year-old protester in northern Aceh province.
“We don’t need officials to just observe. We need their presence to address the issues faced by the community,” Syahrul told AFP.
Protesters carried placards reading: “The Aceh disaster is not a tourist spot; it’s not enough for Prabowo to just take a stroll.” In Sri Lanka, the government unveiled a major compensation package on Friday to rebuild homes and revive businesses wiped out by the natural disaster, which hit the island as it was emerging from its 2022 economic meltdown.
A senior official earlier said recovery and reconstruction might cost up to $7 billion.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million to help with rebuilding.
The money is on top of the $347 million tranche due later this month, part of a four-year, $2.9 billion IMF bailout loan agreed in 2023.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.</p><small>2025-12-07 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637878-sngpl-issues-new-winter-gas-schedule-for-punjab-kp' target='_blank'><strong>SNGPL issues new winter gas schedule for Punjab, KP</strong></a><br><p>

According to the FO statement, President Subianto will arrive in Islamabad and will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
“This will be President Prabowo’s first visit to Pakistan. The last presidential visit from Indonesia was undertaken by President Joko Widodo in 2018,” the statement said, adding that the upcoming visit carries added significance as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
During his stay, the statement said, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on President Prabowo, it added.
“The two sides will discuss a wide-ranging agenda aimed at further strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia relations and exploring new avenues of cooperation, including trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels.”
The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
It further stated: “Pakistan and Indonesia enjoy close, cordial and long-standing relations, underpinned by shared values and mutual interests. The visit of President Prabowo will provide an important opportunity to deepen bilateral ties and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, contributing to the continued growth and diversification of the partnership between the two countries.”</p><small>2025-12-07 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637853-pti-leaders-admit-imrans-x-posts-against-military-sparked-isprs-strong-response' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders admit 'Imran's X posts against military sparked ISPR's strong response'</strong></a><br><p>

Parallel findings from UN monitoring teams and a Washington Post investigation indicate that some of these weapons have already filtered to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
The 137-page report, released this week by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), recounts the scale of the two-decade American project to rebuild Afghanistan. Congress, it notes, provided roughly $144.7 billion between 2002 and 2021 to reconstruct the country and to support a democratic transition — “yet ultimately delivered neither.”
Recent UN assessments reinforce the regional implications of that failure. A UN panel reported that the Afghan Taliban continue providing logistical and operational support to the TTP, while the Washington Post has documented that dozens of US-origin weapons are now surfacing in Pakistan in the hands of terrorists targeting the state.

 

SIGAR attributes part of this spillover to the abrupt loss of visibility after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Due to the Taliban takeover, SIGAR was unable to inspect any of the equipment provided to, or facilities constructed for, the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) following the Afghan government’s collapse,” the report states.
The US Department of Defence, however, has confirmed that approximately $7.1bn worth of American-provided equipment was left behind — including thousands of vehicles, hundreds of thousands of small arms, night-vision devices and more than 160 aircraft.
The consequences of this transfer are already manifesting in Pakistan.
According to the Washington Post, serial numbers of at least 63 seized weapons inside Pakistan match those originally supplied by Washington to Afghan forces. The Washington Post report cited Pakistani officials as saying that some of these rifles and carbines are “significantly superior” to the weaponry commonly used by TTP fighters before 2021.
UN monitoring reports echo this concern. The 36th Monitoring Report (2025) estimates that the TTP maintains a force of around 6,000 fighters spread across Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces of Afghanistan, and shares training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Addressing the UN Security Council, Denmark’s deputy permanent representative Sandra Jensen Landi said the TTP continues to receive “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities” in Kabul.
Earlier UN reports detailed Taliban-provided guesthouses, weapons permits, movement authorisations, and immunity from arrest for TTP leaders — arrangements that have allowed the group to entrench itself deeper in Afghan territory. SIGAR’s own quarterly reports for 2025 cite a string of cross-border attacks, including an assault in South Waziristan that killed 16 Pakistani security personnel.
SIGAR’s final review also revisits the scale — and the futility — of US investment in Afghanistan’s security sector. Between 2002 and June 2025, Washington obligated $31.2bn for ANDSF infrastructure, transportation, and equipment. The US purchased 96,000 ground vehicles, more than 427,000 weapons, 17,400 night-vision devices, and at least 162 aircraft for Afghan forces. As of July 2021, just before the then-Afghan government collapsed, the Afghan Air Force still had 131 operational US-supplied aircraft — virtually all of which are now under Taliban control, according to the report.
Another $11.5bn funded construction of bases, headquarters, and training facilities across Afghanistan, most of which are now either controlled by the Taliban or completely inaccessible to US inspectors, it says.
The report concludes that America’s ambition to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan was hamstrung from the outset by flawed assumptions and misaligned partnerships. Early US decisions to back “corrupt, human-rights-abusing powerbrokers,” SIGAR argues, undermined governance, fuelled insurgent recruitment, and gradually hollowed out the institutions the US was trying to build. The watchdog estimates that $26–29.2bn was lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.
The human cost was far greater. Tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 2,450 US service members were killed, only for the Taliban regime to be restored — and now strengthened by the very equipment the US spent years procuring for its adversaries, it adds.
Despite the collapse, the United States has remained Afghanistan’s single largest donor, having disbursed more than $3.83 billion in humanitarian and development assistance since August 2021 — underscoring Washington’s continued struggle to balance humanitarian obligations with security fears.
As SIGAR ends its mandate after nearly two decades, the final report offers a sobering warning. The Afghanistan experience, it concludes, should serve as a cautionary tale for any future effort to rebuild fragile states on a massive scale — a failure whose ripple effects are now reshaping the security landscape of the wider region.</p><small>2025-12-07 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07113256ce52310.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959635/justice-zafar-ahmed-rajput-sworn-in-as-shc-cj' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput sworn in as SHC CJ</strong></a><br><p>

Born on October 16, 1965 in Hyderabad, Justice Rajput was enrolled as a lawyer for the subordinate judiciary in 1990 and became an advocate of the high court in 2001.
He had also served in the district courts as, initially, he was appointed as a judicial magistrate/civil judge in 1993 and promoted as senior civil judge in 2000. Thereafter, he left the service and started his private practice as a lawyer.
Justice Rajput was appointed as a judge of the SHC in August 2013 and he is set to retire in October 2027, if not elevated to the superior courts.
Presently, the SHC is functioning with 33 judges, including 21 permanent and 12 additional judges, against the sanctioned strength of 40.

Those who were offloaded belong to Faisalabad.
An FIA spokesperson said on Saturday that all of the passengers were going to Jeddah by flight number FZ 356 from Faisalabad airport; however, they were stopped during clearance on the basis of their suspicious movements and evidence.
The passengers included Hamza Ali, Zeeshan Ali, Samiullah, Shiraz Hassan, Imran Waris, Bilal Hassan, Syed Yasin Hussain, Muhammad Rizwan, Ghulam Rasool, Haq Nawaz, Faizal Bibi, Zahida Bibi and Sardaran Bibi.
He said there were reports that female passengers were being used as shields to travel to Europe through Saudi Arabia from various airports on Umrah visas.
During the investigation, suspicious international phone calls were detected which were made from the passengers’ mobile phones. He also added that calls from the phones of offloaded passengers were also detected which were made to an agent identified as Sajid Ali and chats were made with him related to their next illegal journey to Egypt and Libya.
According to the initial investigation, the passengers stated that they were planning to travel from Libya to Europe by boat.
The FIA Anti-Human Trafficking Circle has been handed over the custody of offloaded 13 passengers for investigation and legal action.
Meanwhile, FIA arrested two persons for violation of Copyright Act.
An official said that FIA Corporate Crime Circle team raided Sargodha Road and arrested both suspects Mazhar Ali and Arqam Ali from whom a large quantity of fake products of known registered companies were also recovered.
ACCIDENT: A youth died after he was hit by a speeding car near Tin Pullian Wala Adda on Shorkot Cantonment Road on Saturday.
Rescue 1122 said deceased identified as Amanullah (19) of Mauza Bhangoo was crossing the road when a car ran over him as a result he was critically injured. He was shifted to Shorkot THQ hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.The car driver sped away after the accident.
SUSPENDED: Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jehangir Anwar suspended secretary of union council No 70 of Pirmahal tehsil, Syed Zeeshan Haider, due to his failure to eliminate stray dogs in UC villages which caused rising dog-bite cases.
During his visit to Pirmahal tehsil on Saturday, people complained to the commissioner that a number of children and senior citizens had been bitten by the rabid dogs.
He also warned the assistant director (local government) to boost municipal services in all 17 rural UCs in the tehsil, including focussing on dog culling and sanitation.
The commissioner took notice of the poor condition of the cleanliness in Pirmahal THQ hospital and asked the MS to improve cleanliness within seven days otherwise action be taken against him. He set the Dec 31 deadline for the contractor to complete the construction of trauma centre in the hospital.
During the briefing, he was informed that after the completion of 20-bed trauma centre the total number of beds will increase to 50.
He also directed the assistant commissioner to deploy additional janitors for cleaning the hospital and submit him report. He said the general bus stand at Pirmahal is in bad shape and its essential repairs would be done by District Council funds.
The commissioner also visited the Lyallpur Museum at Faisalabad along with its Chairman Board of Governors Dr Amir Sarfraz. On this occasion, it was decided to expand the Lyallpur Museum and the commissioner said that it is necessary to display more than 5,000 artifacts already kept in stock in the museum. He sought an expansion plan from the curator of the museum and said that the facilities for visitors will be upgraded.
He said that the maintenance issues in the museum should be resolved within two weeks. He visited the galleries containing the history of the region. Additional Commissioner (Coordination) Amir Raza and Curator Maqbool Ahmed Malik were also present.

“Since the creation of the Crime Control Department in January 2025, the national media and human rights bodies have been highlighting incidents of extrajudicial killings by Punjab police,” said the petition filed by lawyers – Mian Dawood, Pervaiz Elahi, Rai Imran Khan and Nadeem Abbas Dogar.
The petition argues that the CCD has created a state of fear and panic in society with the impression that the police can, now, kill any person by declaring him a criminal after preparing his past criminal record by implicating him in already lodged FIRs through supplementary statements.
According to media reports, nearly 1,100 citizens have been killed in police encounters so far, it adds.
The petition argues that the superior judiciary, in multiple judgments, has already declared fake police encounters unconstitutional and illegal.
“Fake encounters are being used as an alternative to the criminal justice system,” it alleges.
The petition states that recent killing of a young lawyer, Zeeshan Dhaddi, at his residence by the police in Vehari is a shameful example of fake encounters.

 

It submits that the Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2022 was enacted specifically to curb fake encounters, which empowers the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to conduct an inquiry into every custodial death within 30 days.
The petition contends that the Lahore High Court in several judgments already directed the federal government and the Punjab chief minister to ensure the implementation of the law.
However, the citizens are still being labelled as suspects and killed in Punjab with impunity and the FIA has not conducted an inquiry into any custodial death to date.
The petitioners ask the high court to immediately halt all police encounters in Punjab and direct the FIA to conduct inquiries into police encounters conducted since the creation of the CCD.
The Punjab government, Punjab police, CCD, FIA, and the federal government have been made parties in the petition.

Tourists were among the dead in the blaze, which broke out at about midnight at a club in Arpora in the north of the coastal state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement that the deaths were “deeply saddening”.
Goa, a former Portuguese colony on the shores of the Arabian Sea, lures millions of tourists every year with its nightlife, sandy beaches and laid-back coastal atmosphere.







“Today is a very painful day for all of us,” Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement, adding that “25 people have lost their lives and six have been injured.” Sawant told journalists that “three to four” tourists had died, without giving their nationalities.
“I have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the entire incident to identify the cause and fix responsibility,” Sawant added.
‘Fire show’
Video images from the Press Trust of India news agency showed rescuers carrying the injured or dead on stretchers down the narrow stone staircase of the Birch nightclub.
“Most people died due to suffocation in the basement and kitchen area,” Nitin V. Raiker, Goa’s fire chief, told Indian broadcaster CNN News18.
“I received information that there was a club party going on, and a fire show was organised in the club. The wooden parts of the club caught fire, and smoke spread throughout the building.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
In May, at least 17 people died after a fire ripped through a three-storey building in the Indian city of Hyderabad.
A month before that, a fierce blaze broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, at least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-12-07 05:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6934cf16ac5ef.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959684/oman-navy-participates-in-bilateral-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>Oman navy participates in bilateral exercise</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Royal Navy of Oman (RNO) flotilla, comprising vessels Al Rasikh and Al Shinas, visited Karachi to participate in the 12th edition of Bilateral Exercise Thamar Al Tayyib (TAT) 2025.

Upon arrival at Karachi Port, the visiting ships were warmly received in a traditional welcome ceremony attended by senior officials of Pakistan Navy. A band of Pakistan Navy performed during the reception.
Exercise TAT-2025 served as an important platform for mutual learning, enhanced interoperability and professional development. Pakistan Navy and Royal Navy of Oman have been conducting the TAT series of exercises regularly since 1980 and TAT-2023 was conducted in Omani waters.
The visit included call-ons with senior Pakistan Navy leadership, onboard receptions and visits to key naval installations and training facilities. Personnel from both navies engaged in professional dialogues, operational discussions and exchange of experiences across various maritime domains.
The visit culminated in the sea phase, where naval ships from both forces conducted advanced operational maneuvers and joint exercises encompassing major facets of modern maritime warfare.

The assessment, conducted as part of Fafen’s “Countering Disinformation Thr­ou­gh Information” campaign, emphasis­­es the role of proactive disclosures in str­engthening institutional transparency and curbing misinformation. A lack of official and authentic information fuels speculation, rumours, assumptions, and conjectures, all of which become major drivers of disinformation that undermi­nes institutional credibility, erodes public trust, and contributes to instability.
The assessment reviewed 190 public bodies, including 36 secretariat departments, 98 attached departments, and 56 autonomous bodies, against the proactive disclosure requirements of Section 5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information (KPRTI) Act, 2013. The Act explicitly mandates the publication of 12 categories of information and emphasises the need for up-to-date, accessible information, including online.
Overall, autonomous bodies and secretariat departments showed the highest compliance at 64pc, while attached departments lagged behind at 50pc.
Among the secretariat departments, the Auqaf, Haj, Religious and Minority Affairs Department and the Minerals Development Department emerged as top performers, each disclosing 92pc of the required information. The Institute of Management Sciences (IMSciences), Central Prison Peshawar, and the Pesh­awar Development Authority (PDA) led among attached departments with 83pc compliance. Among autonomous bodies, the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, also recorded 92pc compliance.
However, the assessment found that nearly half of the public bodies fall below the 50pc mark. Twenty-seven Secretariat Depart­ments, seventy-three Attached Departments, and thirty Autonomous Bodies disclosed only 33-67pc of the required information. In addition, fourteen Attached Departments, two Autonomous Bodies, and one Secretariat Department disclosed merely 17-25pc.
Organisational information, such as a public body’s functions, duties, and structure, was the most widely available category, with 89pc of public bodies sharing these details. Legal frameworks governing public bodies were accessible on 84pc of the websites. Personnel information and details on public services were available on 76pc of the websites.
Significant gaps, however, persist in disclosures related to decision-making and financial transparency. Only 15pc of public bodies shared information about their decision-making processes or opportunities for public consultation.
Budget transparency was notably poor, with only 27pc publishing proposed and actual expenditures.

Addressing a groundbreaking ceremony of a mass transport system, Prime Minister Shehbaz said the recent election results in Punjab reflected the public’s trust in the PML-N leadership.
“In the next three years, the incumbent PML-N government has the mandate to serve the people,” he said, stressing that they should work tirelessly under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.
In remarks broadcast live on national TV channels, he expressed optimism that, on the basis of hard work and the launch of development projects, the next election results across the country would be favourable for the PML-N.
“The journey towards progress and prosperity has just begun, and we will move rapidly along the path of development. In the next elections, owing to this hard work, the PML-N will achieve historic results,” he added.

Recent victory reflects people’s trust in PML-N, Shehbaz claims at groundbreaking of mass transit system project

The ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal and provincial ministers, parliamentarians, members of national and provincial assemblies, relevant authorities, and a large number of citizens.
The prime minister termed the groundbreaking of the mass transport system a major initiative to facilitate city dwellers, as well as residents of surrounding areas, calling it a key step in providing public relief. He said the project was a gift from the Punjab chief minister and would transform the entire district, providing immense relief to commuters, including students, patients, labourers, lawyers, and people from all walks of life.
He recalled Nawaz Sharif had launched development projects at a time when the country was “embroiled in slogans and politicking,” burying that style of politics. He said the former prime minister and chief minister had initiated road networks, health facilities, and numerous other economic initiatives, starting a new chapter in politics during the 1988 elections which, he remarked, continued under PML-N leadership. He said history would remember Nawaz Sharif’s achievements “in golden words”, including making Pakistan a nuclear power in 1998. Had that not been the case, he opined, the situation during the recent conflict with India in May would have been different.
Carrying forward Nawaz Sharif’s legacy, the journey of progress was advancing rapidly under the dynamic leadership of his daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, he added.
He lauded the Punjab government’s initiatives, including the construction of a cancer hospital, the launch of metro bus services, the Clean Punjab campaign, pollution-reduction efforts, provision of housing for the homeless, assistance for flood-affected people, and the provision of missing facilities in schools.
The prime minister said that all these measures spoke for themselves and, like truth, could not be ignored even by political opponents.
CM Maryam, in her remarks, highlighted the key initiatives launched by the provincial government, saying the country had witnessed significant progress and development under the PML-N leadership. She also briefed the audience on the Gujranwala Mass Transit System project.

Police officials said unidentified individuals had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the track in the Nuttal area of Nasir­abad. Upon receiving information about the device, police and Frontier Corps personnel rushed to the site and cordoned off the area.
The bomb disposal squad also reached the location and safely defused the IED, Nasir­abad SSP Ghulam Sarwar Bhaou said. He added that the attackers wanted to target the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express, but timely action saved the train from a potential blast.
Trains halted in Jacobabad 
Meanwhile, the Jaffar Express arriving from Peshawar to Quetta and the Bolan Mail coming from Karachi were stopped at Jacobabad Railway Station due to security reasons.
According to railway officials, both trains were halted on Saturday at Jacobabad to ensure the safety of passengers. Authorities are assessing the situation, and services will be resumed once conditions are deemed secure.
Railway officials further stated that the Chaman Express, scheduled to run from Quetta to Chaman today (Sunday), has also been cancelled.

At the same time, market players believe it will be difficult for the State Bank to engineer a weaker rupee to boost exports, arguing that past experiences of devaluation failed to deliver a sustained increase in export volumes.
Some currency experts said the scope for further devaluation to support exports was limited, particularly as the US dollar itself has come under pressure against major global currencies.
“There is no mathematical calculation behind this expectation that the dollar may slip below Rs280 by the end of this month. It is the market sentiment and it happens at the end of the year,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He believes the dollar will slip below Rs280 only for a brief period.

Experts warn against devaluation, say past episodes failed to increase exports

Other experts said dollar demand would remain steady but sentiment had improved after a $3 billion rollover from Saudi Arabia, which they expect to support the rupee.
“If anything, the risk right now is that the rupee may trade below 280 per dollar, which could destabilise export-based industries, whereas a mild depreciation would be the right way forward,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
During the current fiscal year, the rupee has appreciated gradually, with more noticeable gains since July 31, when the dollar hit its peak for the year. On July 31, the dollar was traded at Rs284.27, compared to Rs280.42 on the last trading day of the outgoing week.

 

One dealer noted that the US dollar has already lost about 12 per cent against major international currencies, arguing that the rupee had effectively helped the dollar remain relatively strong and stable in the local market.
Exports, however, have been declining. They fell 15.4pc in November, swelling the trade deficit for the first five months of FY26 to $37.2bn and putting pressure on the current account.
The market has been rife with speculation that the government is under pressure to devalue the rupee to support exporters, but the currency’s gradual appreciation has dismissed such perceptions.
“Yes, the calls for a weaker rupee have grown louder. You hear the usual arguments: global demand is soft, INR (the Indian rupee) drifting towards 90 per dollar, exporters cannot price orders due to high costs, and a correction will magically ‘fix competitiveness’,” Mr Mamsa said.
The rupee had collapsed from 180 to 300 against the dollar in just two years — one of the sharpest devaluations in the region. But there was no meaningful export boom, no import compression beyond what the SBP manually enforced and no structural improvement.
“A few publications this week are again glorifying REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) and implying that a weaker rupee is somehow ‘necessary’. It’s a familiar narrative: REER goes above 100, currency is ‘overvalued’, therefore devalue it. It’s an incomplete way to look at a modern FX (foreign exchange) market,” Mr Mamsa said.
Currency experts also pointed out that the IMF has not treated REER as a primary barometer for the exchange rate since 2018, but exporters continue to exert political pressure for devaluation to shore up margins.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the officials were involved “in the oppression of women and girls and in undermining good governance or the rule of law” in Afghanistan.
Australia was one of several nations which pulled troops out of Afghanistan in Aug 2021, after being part of a Nato-led international force that trained Afghan security forces and fought the Taliban for two decades after Western-backed forces ousted them from power in 2001.
The Taliban, since regaining power in Afghanistan, have been criticised for deeply restricting the rights and freedom of women and girls through bans on education and work.
The Taliban government says it respects women’s rights, in line with its interpretation of Islamic law and local custom.
Wong, the Australian foreign minister, said in a statement the sanctions targeted three Taliban ministers and the chief justice, accusing them of restricting access for girls and women “to education, employment, freedom of movement and the ability to participate in public life”.
The measures were part of a new Australian government framework that enabled it to “directly impose its own sanctions and travel bans to increase pressure on the Taliban, targeting the oppression of the Afghan people”, Wong said.
Australia took in thousands of evacuees, mostly women and children, from Afghanistan after the Taliban retook power in the country, where much of the population now relies on humanitarian aid to survive.
