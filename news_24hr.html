Part of the multi-storey Islamic boarding school on Indonesia’s Java island collapsed as more than 150 students gathered for afternoon prayers.
Around half a dozen youngsters are still unaccounted for.
“We hope we can conclude the recovery today (Monday), and we will return the bodies [to the families],” National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operations director Yudhi Bramantyo told a press conference on Monday.
The collapse was Indonesia’s deadliest disaster so far this year, Budi Irawan, the deputy head of the national disaster agency (BNPB), said.
Investigators have been examining the cause of the collapse, but initial indications suggest that substandard construction may have contributed to the incident, according to experts.
The families of the missing agreed last Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end.
Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.
At least three people were killed and dozens were injured in September when a building hosting a prayer recital collapsed in West Java.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06161740392a0c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946993/at-least-four-dead-28-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-punjab-over-last-24-hours-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least four dead, 28 injured in rain related-incidents across Punjab over last 24 hours: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least four people have died and another 28 have been injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents across Punjab as the province received heavy rainfall, a spokesperson for the Rescue 1122 Punjab said on Monday.
According to a weather alert issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) last week, a strong westerly weather system was likely to affect the upper catchments of all major rivers, along with Islamabad, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing “heavy to very heavy wind-thunderstorms and rains” from October 5 to October 7.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Punjab Farooq Ahmed said in a statement that, “Over the last 24 hours, four people, including two children, were killed in rain-related incidents, while another 28 were left injured.”
He added that in Faisalabad, a 12-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy lost their lives as the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rains, injuring another seven people.
“A 70-year-old man was killed in Nankana Sahib, while a 65-year-old man died in a similar incident in Kasur”, the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.
“Meanwhile, at least six people were injured in separate roof collapse incidents in Samundri, Jaranwala, and Kakarwala, four were injured in Chak, three in Manawala, and five people were injured in Faqirwali, Allah Abad, and Sahiwal in separate incidents.”
Per the statement, another two people were injured in roof and wall collapse incidents in Lahore.
Separately, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), “Most districts of Punjab received heavy rains in the last 24 hours, with Multan recording the highest level of rain water at 113mm.”
It added that Faislabad recorded 78mm of rain, Bahawalpur 44mm, Lahore 40mm, Khaewal 28mm, Toba Tek Singh 25mm, Sialkot 19mm, Attock 10mm, “ the statement said.
Gujranwala, Muree, and Sahiwal recorded 8mm, Okara 7mm, Narowal 6mm, Mangla 5mm, Gujrat and Hafizabad 3mm, while Layyah and Kasur recorded 1mm each, the spokesperson said.
PDMA warned that rainfall will continue in most parts of Punjab in the next 24 hours, with rain expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujarat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, and Mianwali.
The spokesperson also cautioned that the “water level in rivers may increase due to the rain, with water in the Chenab River to rise by October 7.”
“While the levels in the rivers Sutlej and Ravi will depend on the release of water from India,” the statement quoted him as saying. “Water level at Indus and Jhelum is expected to rise as well.
The PDMA requested citizens to take precautionary measures and placed relevant authorities on high alert, as per the statement.
Rain emergency declared in Multan
A rain emergency was declared in Multan after the district received heavy rainfall on Sunday night, followed by another spell today afternoon, Managing Director Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Khalid Raza Khan said in a statement.
He requested people to take necessary precautions, including avoiding electricity poles and staying indoors.
On Saturday, Director General PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, while addressing a media briefing in Lahore, had said showers were to begin in Punjab from Sunday and continue till October 7 (Tuesday) in the northern parts.
The PDMA chief said the north and northeastern regions from Rawalpindi to Lahore were likely to receive 30 to 35 millimetres of rainfall on average, while the province’s southern parts could see 5 to 10mm.
He warned that the intensity of the showers would increase on October 6 and 7, with 50 to 70mm of rain anticipated in northern and northeastern Punjab, extending into central districts as well.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061640017ba854b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947001/nobel-medicine-prize-goes-to-researchers-into-immune-system-precision' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel medicine prize goes to researchers into immune system precision</strong></a><br><p>American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments.
This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute.
Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour,” Kyodo news agency reported.
Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’
The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king.
Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan.
“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.
The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added.
After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing.
Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron REGN.O to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.
Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca AZN.L.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BAYGn.DEBlueRock.
Medicine the first prize of Nobel season
The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars.
The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank.
Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime.
Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines.
Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types.
Medicine, in accordance with tradition, kicks off the annual Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature, peace and economics, with the remainder set to be announced over the coming days.
More than a century after their inception, the Nobel Prizes remain steeped in tradition. The awards culminate in ceremonies attended by the royal families of Sweden and Norway, followed by lavish banquets held on December 10 — the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061602172663e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946991/govt-should-take-parliament-into-confidence-on-new-us-policy-raza-rabbani' target='_blank'><strong>Govt should take parliament into confidence on ‘new US policy’: Raza Rabbani</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairperson Raza Rabbani emphasised on Monday that the federal government should “immediately” take parliament into confidence on its “new US policy”, particularly mentioning media reports about the sale of rare minerals and the supposed plan to offer Pasni port to Washington.
“The federal government has not taken the people or parliament into confidence on the dynamics of the new relationship with the United States,” Rabbani stated in a press release. He added, “It is the right of the people to know the details and the direction of the foreign policy. In history, the US has never been a reliable friend to depend upon.”
On the sale of precious and rare minerals to American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM), he said it was “unfortunate” that information about the deal had come through the media.
He stressed that “real stakeholders” in this matter were the provinces, which should have been taken into confidence through the Council of Common Interests.
“The federal government fails to realise that Article 172 [of the 1973] Constitution […] is in operation, [and] the provinces are 50 per cent owners of the mineral resources,” Rabbani pointed out.
According to Article 172: “Any property which has no rightful owner shall, if located in a province, vest in the government of that province, and in every other case, in the federal government […]  Subject to the existing commitments and obligations, mineral oil and natural gas within the province or the territorial water adjacent thereto shall vest jointly and equally in that province and the federal government.”
In this connection, he also recalled that the provinces had “rejected the federal government-sponsored minerals law”.
The legislation has particularly faced opposition in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and even ignited debate on resource control.
 
 

Rabbani further stated that it was “alarming” to learn from the international media that Pasni port may be offered to Washington. “This will have very serious repercussions on the other regional relationships,” he said.
He asserted that the federal government should “immediately take parliament into confidence on the various aspects of its new US policy”.
The former Senate chairperson’s assertion comes against the backdrop of
Pakistan is entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
USSM, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
But the opposition party, the PTI, has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram referred to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington. He warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests“.
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06095850a272dba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946958/welcome-step-pm-hails-malaysian-announcement-of-import-of-halal-meat-worth-200m-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Welcome step’: PM hails Malaysian announcement of import of Halal meat worth $200m from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed on Monday his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries.
The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan.
 






PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”.
“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”
The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.
Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”.
Moreover, he said, “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny.
“Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.”
PM concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”.
PM addresses business forum
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday that Pakistan and Malaysia can create a new market through joint efforts and also become potential suppliers to other countries.
Addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries improve further.
“This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.”
“We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”.
Referring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “gamechanger”.
‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’
Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together.
PM Shehbaz began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation and called the country a “second home”.
“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.
“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.
 






PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser.
“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.
“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.
“Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.
 






The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said.
He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.
“It  will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will  achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come it will increase and  have a quantum jump,” he said.
The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.
“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.
 






He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.
“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering.
Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia.
 






PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine
In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.
He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million.
Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”.
“So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said.
Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.
Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.
He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue.
 
 

“We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.
“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.
PM given guard of honour
After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.”
“He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said.
“The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.
 






According to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier.
Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06150158a189d1e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946992/un-to-decide-on-broad-eu-backed-investigation-into-afghanistan-atrocities' target='_blank'><strong>UN to decide on broad EU-backed investigation into Afghanistan atrocities</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Human Rights Council will decide on Monday on an EU proposal to set up a UN investigation into abuses in Afghanistan, which could enable criminal investigations into suspected violations by both the Taliban and foreign troops.
The European Union motion calls for investigators to prepare evidence for future court proceedings and is among the strongest forms of UN rights probe, on par with existing investigations into crimes in Syria and Myanmar.
The United States, which had troops in Afghanistan until 2021 within a NATO coalition, has previously opposed scrutiny of its actions, for example, by the International Criminal Court, but backed research into suspected Taliban violations.
President Donald Trump has disengaged from the council and did not take a stance in these negotiations, diplomats said. However, a State Department spokesperson said: “Under the leadership of President Trump, the United States government will not tolerate international organisations that attempt to exert unlawful jurisdiction over American troops.”
Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch, called the launch a “significant step that could break a decades-long cycle of impunity”.
“If it gives just one regional commander pause for thought on committing violations because he knows there is a case file open, then it’s worth it.”
Comprehensive probe
For years, both Afghan and international rights groups have sought such a probe. Calls have become louder as the Taliban tightened restrictions on women and freedom of expression.
The Taliban authorities say they respect rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law.
The new investigation would cooperate with an existing ICC probe. The ICC has previously indicated it would deprioritise suspected crimes by US forces after Trump imposed sanctions in 2020 over its Afghanistan work.
While the EU proposal does not mention abuses by international troops, it is described as comprehensive and has no time limit, meaning it could address these, diplomats said.
Investigations launched by the 47-member council can lead to war crimes prosecutions. Some countries which sent troops to Afghanistan, such as Britain and Australia, have initiated inquiries, but prosecutions have been rare.
It was not immediately clear whether states would vote on the proposal, which Ukraine, Norway, and South Korea also back.
China has raised doubts about the probe’s costs and whether it would help improve local rights, diplomats said.
China’s diplomatic mission did not respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-10-06 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06134543f35d4fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946988/saudi-govt-allows-holders-of-all-visa-types-to-perform-umrah-while-in-kingdom' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi govt allows holders of all visa types to perform Umrah while in kingdom</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia has announced that visitors and residents holding any type of visa will now be permitted to perform Umrah while in the Kingdom, a statement from the Ministry of Haj and Umrah said on Sunday.
According to the Saudi Press Agency, the ministry has indicated that people holding “personal and family visit visas, electronic tourist visas, transit visas, work visas, and other types of visas” will be able to perform Umrah in the kingdom during their stay.
The ministry said the move was part of the Kingdom’s efforts to streamline procedures for Umrah performers and broaden access to services within the Haj and Umrah system, in support of the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030.
“This step reflects the Kingdom’s ongoing commitment to facilitating the arrival of Muslims from around the world to perform their rituals with ease and tranquillity,” the statement said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
In July, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistic measures for the pilgrimage season.</p><small>2025-10-06 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06125528adfdf8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946978/islamabad-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-omar-ayub-2-others-over-2024-sangjani-rally' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues bailable arrest warrants for Omar Ayub, 2 others over 2024 Sangjani rally</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad anti-terrorism court on Monday issued bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zartaj Gul and central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram in a case pertaining to the Sangjani rally in September last year.
On Sept 8, 2024, clashes took place between PTI leaders and the Islamabad police as party supporters rallied on the outskirts of the city, demanding the “immediate release” of ex-premier Imran Khan and criticising the government for marginalising the party. Following that, at least 10 PTI MNAs were arrested on Sept 9 and 10 last year from different areas of Islamabad, including the Parliament House.
Today, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over the hearing, where lawyers Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and Murtaza Toori appeared on behalf of the PTI leaders.
The judge rejected Ayub’s application seeking an exemption from the hearing. “None of them have appeared before the court even once,” Judge Sipra observed.
 
 

Subsequently, he ordered that the three PTI leaders be arrested and produced before the court. The hearing was adjourned till October 20.
Akram reacted to the development by writing “warrant factories” in a post on X, sharing screenshots of various media outlets airing the news of the warrants being issued.
 






Ayub was among the key PTI leaders who had addressed the Sangjani public rally. Others who spoke included Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan, Hammad Azhar, and Ali Muhammad Khan.
Late-night parliament arrests over Sangjani rally
In September last year, the PTI had said nearly a dozen of its lawmakers, including Akram, had been arrested. Gul and Ayub were also wanted by the police, but fearing arrest, some of them had taken shelter inside Parliament House.
Late night on Sept 9, 2024, law enforcement agencies arrested at least three key members from different areas of Islamabad, including Sher Afzal Marwat from the Parliament House.
Just after 3am the next day, plainclothesmen stormed the Parliament House — disconne­c­ting the power supply and barging into the building’s Ser­vices Branch — to whisk away more PTI legislators.
 
 

Others taken into custody over their alleged role in violence at the Sangjani rally included Malik Amir Dogar, Ahmed Chattha, Zain Qureshi, Zubair Khan Wazir, Awais Haider Jakhar, Syed Shah Ahad Ali Shah, Nasim Ali Shah and Yousuf Khan Khattak.

“On June 14 next year, we’re going to have a big UFC fight at the White House — right at the White House, on the grounds of the White House,” Trump told a crowd of Navy sailors at the huge naval base Norfolk in Virginia.
He did not mention that June 14 is his birthday or that next year will be his 80th.
This year, on Trump’s 79th birthday, he held a military parade to commemorate the founding of the US Army.
In August, UFC boss Dana White said the mixed martial arts bout at the White House would be held on July 4 next year, the day the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its founding.
Trump has been a regular guest at the often-bloody UFC contests, where fighters punch, kick, and grapple with their opponent in a no-holds-barred battle to submission or knockout.
Bringing the brutal combat sport to the centre of US political power will mark a historic first.
At a press conference shared on UFC’s YouTube channel, White said that early next year, “we’ll start looking at building the White House card, which I will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled in the history of this company.”
 


UFC is the largest and most successful organisation in the burgeoning world of MMA, a blend of martial arts disciplines like jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, boxing, and wrestling.
Bouts take place in an eight-sided ring — dubbed “The Octagon” —bounded by a chainlink fence.
With few exceptions — such as eye-gouging — male and female fighters are allowed to employ almost any technique to attack their opponent.
The sport’s popularity with young men — a key demographic in the 2024 US election — and Trump’s long association with the UFC have made the president a regular fixture at some of its more high-profile events, where he is greeted like a rock star.
Its brutal nature and high injury rate mean the sport is controversial, with doctors decrying the potential for brain damage amongst fighters who are repeatedly hit in the head, though it has gained increasing mainstream acceptance in recent years.</p><small>2025-10-06 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06133451256f4ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946986/frances-new-pm-sebastien-lecornu-resigns-hours-after-cabinet-unveiled-deepening-political-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>France’s new PM Sebastien Lecornu resigns hours after cabinet unveiled, deepening political crisis</strong></a><br><p>France’s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned on Monday, barely 14 hours after appointing his new cabinet, after allies and foes alike threatened to topple his government, driving French stocks and the euro sharply lower.
His swift resignation was unexpected and unprecedented, and marked another major deepening of France’s political crisis.
The far-right National Rally immediately urged President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election.
After weeks of consultations with political parties across the board, Lecornu, a close ally of Macron, had appointed his ministers on Sunday and they had been set to hold their first meeting on Monday afternoon.
 
 

But the new cabinet line-up had angered opponents and allies alike, who either found it too right-wing or not sufficiently so, raising questions on how long it could last, at a time when France is already mired deep in political crisis, with no group holding a majority in a fragmented parliament.
Lecornu handed his resignation to Macron on Monday morning.
“Mr Sebastien Lecornu has submitted the resignation of his Government to the President of the Republic, who has accepted it,” the Elysee’s press office said.
French politics has become increasingly unstable since Macron’s re-election in 2022 for want of any party or grouping holding a parliamentary majority.

The French president’s decision to call a snap parliamentary election last year deepened the crisis by producing an even more fragmented parliament. Macron named Lecornu, a former defence minister, to the post last month and was his fifth prime minister in two years.
“There can be no return to stability without a return to the polls and the dissolution of the National Assembly,” National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said after Lecornu resigned.
 






Daunting task of finding approval for austerity budget
Lecornu had faced the daunting task of finding approval in a deeply divided parliament for an austerity budget for next year.
His two immediate predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. France’s public debt has reached a record high, official data showed last week.
Paris’s benchmark CAC 40 index dropped 1.5 per cent as Lecornu resigned, making it the worst-performing index in Europe, as banking shares came under heavy fire, leaving BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 4pc to 5pc.
The euro slid 0.7pc on the day to $1.1665.
 
 

France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is now the European Union’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the 60pc permitted under EU rules.
Previous governments had rammed the last three annual budgets through parliament without a vote, a method allowed by the constitution but deeply criticised by the opposition.
But Lecornu promised last week to ensure lawmakers were able to vote on the bill.
France has been mired in deadlock since Macron gambled on snap parliamentary elections in June last year in the hopes of bolstering his authority. The move backfired, leaving the Macron-friendly bloc in the assembly in a minority.</p><small>2025-10-06 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061242517dd00e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946979/fo-says-evacuation-of-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmad-khan-hoped-for-in-next-couple-of-days' target='_blank'><strong>FO says evacuation of ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan hoped for in ‘next couple of days’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office said on Monday it was making efforts for the safe evacuation of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Muhstaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, and hoped that the process could be “successfully concluded within the next couple of days”.
Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF). The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it and detained the activists on board.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO said in a statement.
“With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO said.
The statement also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”.
 






Last week, Pakistan and several other countries condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for the release of those detained by Israel. “We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release,“ he said in a post on X on Thursday.
In a later post, he commended the “dignified participation” of Pakistani activists, including Mushtaq, in the humanitarian mission.
“The government of Pakistan … strongly demands the return of its citizens, praying and striving for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the homeland,” he added.
 






On Friday, he assured JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq.
The PM told Naeem that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations.
Subsequently, the FO assured in a statement yesterday that it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens” who were detained following the interception of the GSF by Israeli forces.
Particularly mentioning Mushtaq, the FO said it had been confirmed through the “diplomatic channels of a friendly European country” that Mushtaq was in the custody of Israeli forces, “safe and in good health”.
“We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis,” the FO added.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir noted in a post on X today that the activists detained during the Israeli raid were receiving a hero’s welcome upon their return home. “God willing, [former] senator Mushtaq will also return to a hero’s welcome,” he added.
 






Israel had previously blocked attempts to bring aid to Gaza as well. In June, the aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.</p><small>2025-10-06 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06113027d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946972/cop-martyred-as-miscreants-attack-police-checkpoint-in-kps-kohat' target='_blank'><strong>Cop martyred as miscreants attack police checkpoint in KP’s Kohat</strong></a><br><p>A cop was martyred while a Frontier Constabulary (FC) official was injured when a police checkpoint came under attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Monday.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have witnessed terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Kohat District Police Officer (DPO) Dr Zahidullah Khan said that a “large number of miscreants” had attacked a checkpoint in Kohat’s Darra Adamkhel from “multiple sides” at 1am.
He said that an exchange of fire then took place between the police and the unidentified assailants, which claimed the life of one cop and left an FC official injured. He said that the exchange of fire went on for two-and-a-half hours.
“The unidentified assailants aimed to capture the checkpoint, but their attempt was thwarted,” he said, adding that a search operation was currently underway.
“Three improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been recovered so far during the clearance operation,” the DPO said.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred cop. In a statement, he also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“The sacrifices of the police in the war against terrorism will not go in vain,” he added.
The attack comes a day after a soldier was martyred and another injured when unidentified assailants opened fire on them near KP’s Bannu district.
On Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
According to a Dawn report, KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.</p><small>2025-10-06 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627202-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-issued-for-ptis-omar-ayub-zartaj-gul-in-sangjani-rally-case' target='_blank'><strong>Arrest warrants issued for PTI leaders including Omar Ayub in Sangjani rally case</strong></a><br><p>

A deepening depression over the Arabian Sea on Friday intensified into a cyclone by the name of Shakhti, escalating into a severe cyclonic storm within the next 24 hours as it headed towards the central-north Arabian Sea.
A PMD update issued at 11am and posted on social media platform X said, “The severe cyclonic storm Shakhti over west central and adjoining northwest of the Arabian Sea has weakened into a cyclonic storm during the last six hours.”
The department said that the system was likely to move east-southeastwards over the same region and weaken into depression by the next 24 hours, adding that under its influence isolated rain was likely in the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan today.
The statement further added that sea conditions were expected to remain rough due to “squally winds” gusting to 90 kilometres per hour near the Sindh coast, warning fishermen against venturing into the deep sea until tomorrow.
While sea conditions will remain “very rough to high and then very high” over the north-west and west-central Arabian Sea over the next 24 hours, the severity is expected to gradually reduce after this.
 






According to state-run news agency APP, electricity supply has been affected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, Charsadda, Shabqadar, and Swabi due to heavy rain.
It quoted the Peshawar Electric Supply Corporation (Pesco) spokesperson as saying that 113 feeders had developed faults amid rains, disrupting electricity supply to several areas. Of the affected feeders, 55 had been repaired so far, he added.
Meanwhile, the spokesperson said, Pesco field staff was put on high alert.
On Sunday, Security forces and locals rescued over a dozen fishing boats trapped in the Arabian Sea by high tides triggered by the cyclone.
Balochistan’s Provincial Secretary for Fisheries Tariq Qamar Baloch said that all field officers had been placed on high alert and the department was in close coordination with the Pakistan Navy, Levies Force, and local administration to monitor the situation.

The fire began in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Sawai Man Singh Hospital, “releasing toxic gases”, hospital official Anurag Dhakad told the ANI news agency, adding that a short-circuit was the suspected cause.
“Five patients are still critical,” he said, while 13 had been safely evacuated from the two wards of the hospital in the capital of Rajasthan, which draws patients from across the desert state.
 






Fire brigade teams arrived within 20 minutes after the fire began late on Sunday in the neurosurgery ICU, hospital superintendent Sushil Kumar Bhati told the agency.
Most of the hospital equipment was gutted in the roughly two hours it took to bring the fire under control, however, broadcaster NDTV said.
Jaipur Police chief Biju George Joseph said a forensic investigation would determine the exact cause.
The government of Rajasthan, whose capital is Jaipur, has set up a panel to investigate the cause, ANI said.
 
 

It will study the hospital’s firefighting arrangements and the management’s response, as well as steps to avoid similar incidents, the agency added.
Similar hospital fires in India have been blamed on short circuits in electronic equipment.

Police were called on Sunday evening to the city’s Inner West, where the alleged gunman was firing from his property at random at passing cars and police.
A large contingent of police swarmed the area and locked down the street, before entering the property above a business and arresting the man. They seized a rifle from the scene.
Office worker Joe Azar said he was working across the road when he heard what he thought were fireworks or rocks being thrown at the windows.
“Some guy’s windshield blew up, then the bus stop glass shattered,” Azar told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
“The surreal feeling kicked in like, ‘Oh, this is what’s happening’,” he said.
“It was frantic. It all happened so quick, so I couldn’t comprehend what was going on,” he added.
Police had initially said up to a hundred bullets were fired and 20 people were wounded. But on Monday, New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry revised the number of shots to around 50 and the toll of wounded to 16.
“In my 35 years in the police, there’s been very few incidents of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street,” he added.
The accused shooter was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries to the area around his eyes sustained during his arrest.
No charges have been laid against the alleged gunman yet. A police investigation is ongoing.
One man self-presented to hospital with a gunshot wound following the incident, but would likely survive, police said. The remaining people were treated by ambulance staff for minor injuries, including shattered glass as bullets hit their car windows.
‘Terrifying’
New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon on Monday described the shooting as “serious and terrifying”.
The gunman’s motive was unclear but there were “no known links to terrorism activity or any gang activity”, he told local radio station 2GB.
One witness who gave his name as Tadgh told the national broadcaster ABC he had been watching rugby when he first heard the gunshots.
“It was very loud and ‘bang, bang, bang’ and flash-bangs and sparks and smoke and the whole works. It was something out of a movie, really,” he said.
Mass shootings are relatively rare in Australia. A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place since 1996, when a lone gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania.
In August, alleged gunman Dezi Freeman went on the run in the bush after being accused of killing two police officers. He remains at large.
And in 2022, six people including two police officers were killed in a shooting near the small Queensland town of Wieambilla.</p><small>2025-10-06 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06104628a1cb3d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946854/govt-has-withdrawn-aimal-walis-security-claims-anp' target='_blank'><strong>Govt has withdrawn Aimal Wali’s security, claims ANP</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Awami National Party central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan and his family, following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament.
The withdrawal of security came despite assurances by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in a personal telephone call to Aimal Wali with the latter thanking the chief minister.
However, it transpired later that police personnel were reportedly withdrawn which, the provincial government’s spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted.
 






Meanwhile, the chief minister’s focal person on digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, in a post on social media platform ‘X’ said the provincial government deployed four police personnel for Mr Khan’s security while eight personnel were deployed at his residence in Charsadda district.
 







CM’s focal person says four policemen deployed for ANP leader’s security while eight personnel posted at his residence in Charsadda

However, ANP’s central spokesperson said it was an offer which was not accepted as yet.
He appreciated the provincial government’s gesture. “We thank the KP government but, also, we can provide security to our provincial president,” he said.
Similarly, Walibagh, the residence of Aimal Wali, said that federal government had also withdrawn Federal Constabulary from the abode of ANP chief and his father Asfandyar Wali Khan.
On Saturday, federal government withdrew Federal Constabulary personnel deployed for Aimal Wali’s security following his speech wherein he criticised Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for allegedly presenting samples of rare earth metals to US President Donald Trump in Washington.
Aimal Wali, in a tweet on his X account [former twitter] said that federal government/interior ministry took back all the security personnel allotted to him, his father and family. He said that if anything happened to him or his family, the responsibility would rest with the government.
 






“I’ll keep on speaking for the public and am ready for anything coming my way. Yes, I will be moving more securely with private personal and Salaars [referring to ANP workers],” the ANP president tweeted.
Soon after the federal government’s decision, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur called Aimal Wali and assured him that the provincial government would make security arrangements for him and his family and directed KP police chief in that regard.
On Sunday, however, KP police personnel assigned for security of the ANP president were also called back. None among the police officials took the responsibility while KP police’s security division, established for providing security to VVIPs, bureaucrats and politicians, could not be reached for an official version despite repeated attempts.
“It was early in the morning when provincial government also withdrew Aimal Wali’s security and called back police personnel,” ANP central spokesperson Ehsanullah told Dawn. He said that party workers took over security of the ANP president and his father.
A statement later issued from Bacha Khan Markaz, the central office of ANP, here said that KP police chief completely disregarded directives of chief minister. He said that Mr Gandapur appeared completely powerless against the group comprising ‘Khaki patrons’ of the hybrid regime entrenched in central government and their political lackeys.
It said that Mr Gandapur personally assured Senator Aimal Wali Khan that his security detail would be maintained and not reduced.
However, despite assurance, all relevant police personnel were ordered to report back to line duties this [Sunday] morning, he said. The ANP central spokesperson asked Mr Gandapur to clarify his position.
He said that the hybrid regime refused to abide by the Constitution concerning provincial autonomy and federation. He said that ANP would devise a comprehensive plan regarding security of its leadership to effectively counter such violations and ensure protection of party leadership.
Also, the ANP leadership termed withdrawal of security of the party chief an attack on 18th Amendment.
Former chief minister and central leader of ANP Ameer Haider Khan Hoti termed the decision of withdrawing security of Aimal Wali a political revenge and questioned if any political leader’s security would be determined by centre’s likes or dislikes. He also questioned that if asking questions in the parliament was a crime.
“Withdrawing [ANP president’s] security for raising Constitutional questions in parliament is an attempt to suppress opposition,” he said.
Mr Hoti said in a statement that federal government’s interference in provincial matters was a threat to democracy.
He said that provincial police chief refused to follow Mr Gandapur’s orders.
On the other hand, KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif refuted the ANP leadership’s claim, saying provincial government did not withdraw Aimal Wali’s security.
“If the chief minister has ordered, security will be provided. How it is possible that the chief minister issues orders and security is not provided,” he questioned while talking to Dawn.

They also warned the government to refrain from endorsing any proposal, including the Abraham Accords, which they said was against the will of the Palestinian people.
Dozens of caravans from different parts of the city converged near the Nursery bus stop on Sharea Faisal, where they formed a mammoth rally addressed by leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).
Riding motorbikes, cars, buses and other modes of transport, the participants carried Palestinian flags and placards bearing images of Hamas leaders.
 







JI chief warns Islamabad against joining Abraham Accords

The march was organised by the party as a show of solidarity with Gaza, particularly in the backdrop of Israeli aggression against the Freedom Flotilla.
In his address, JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman made it clear to Islamabad that any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine, set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would not be tolerated at any cost.
 
 

“Even decades ago, the All India Muslim League used to protest against Israel,” he said. “On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one was the Pakistan Resolution and the other was for Palestine. There is only one state, and that is Palestine, and there is only one leadership in Gaza, and that is Hamas,” he said while urging the government to recognise Hamas and support it as the legitimate representative of the people of Gaza.
“Don’t dare to accept Israel or join the Abraham Accords,” he warned.
He said that the United States was directly responsible for the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and therefore had no right to deliver lectures on humanity.
The JI leader claimed that Israel had failed militarily in Gaza as it could not secure the release of its soldiers from Hamas and was, in fact, engaging with the group in one way or another to secure their freedom.
“Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class here is not even willing to mention Hamas by name because they fear any movement that originates from the people. The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the US and Israel,” the JI chief added.
He also stressed the need for another UN, saying the current one had become a total failure and an “agent” of the US and Israel, having never resolved the issues faced by Muslims.
He was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.
 






“We want to tell the rulers and opposition parties of Pakistan to abandon hypocrisy and double standards. The people of Gaza and Hamas must be accepted, and Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan,” he said.
He also called on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, currently in Adiala Jail, to express solidarity with Hamas and condemn Israel and the US.
“From Karachi’s Keamari to the mountains of Chitral, the public is united in one voice: we will not accept slavery to America,” he said.
“Greta Thunberg was tortured and forced to kiss the Israeli flag — this is the real face of the Zionist state,” he added.
Other leaders, including Dr Osama Razi, Monem Zafar and Advocate Saifuddin, also addressed the rally.

The police registered a case against one identified and eight unknown suspects.
DPO Sohaib Ashraf took notice of the incident and directed the Kot Momin SDPO to arrest the suspects.
Meanwhile, Sargodha Commissioner Jahanzeb Awan, along with Deputy Commissioner retired Capt Muhammad Waseem, visited Kot Momin tehsil to review the ongoing and completed flood damage assessment surveys in Khan Muhammad, Sial Mor and Rahanwala areas.
On this occasion, the survey teams were briefed about the survey methodology and data collection. The commissioner directed to ensure transparency and accuracy in all stages of the survey.
He said that the survey process should be completed soon so that the affected families could get compensated. He said that after this, two additional re-verification teams would thoroughly check the records to ensure that there were no mistakes or omissions.
 
 

The commissioner stressed that the district administration, PDMA and the revenue department should maintain close contact with each other so that the relief money reaches the real victims directly.
ACCIDENT: A man died after being hit by a high-speed train on Sunday near Bhalwal.
The body of the deceased, identified as Ali Raza, was handed over to his heirs after necessary formalities.
As per details, Ali Raza, a father of two, lost his life after being hit by a high-speed train near Bhalwal on the Sargodha-Lalamusa railway track. The Railway Police were investigating the incident.
Meanwhile, two people were killed and another two were seriously injured when a car fell into a canal due to high speed.
According to details, Naveed Ahmed (38) and Muhammad Khan (45) of Kale Da Kot died when their car fell into a canal near Ghulapur Bangla of Kot Momin in Sargodha. Two others, Bilal and Omar Hayat, were seriously injured in the accident and were shifted to the THQ Hospital.
ANTI-SMOG CAMPAIGN: Additional deputy commissioner general (ADCG) Rana Muhammad Abu Bakar has directed all departments to intensify activities to eliminate smog.
In a meeting of the district anti-smog committee, he said that awareness should be provided to farmers to prevent stubble burning. Action should be taken against violators under a zero tolerance policy, he added.
 
 

He said that the traffic police should take strict action against smoke emitting vehicles, while the regional transport authority should ensure transparency in issuance of fitness certificates.
Along with this, the district agriculture, environment and local government departments should jointly run an awareness campaign so that the public could be informed about the harm caused by smog and how to prevent it.
Mr Abu Bakar said that as per the instructions of the Punjab government, no negligence would be tolerated during the anti-smog campaign. All officers should be present in the field and ensure compliance, so that citizens could be provided with a clean and healthy environment.

The assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Sharaa, whose forces led a coalition that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December after more than 13 years of civil war.
Dozens of members of the local committees were queueing at Syria’s National Library, formerly called the Assad National Library, to cast their vote.
According to the organising committee, more than 1,500 candidates — just 14 per cent of them women — are running for the assembly, which will have a renewable 30-month mandate.

Assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Al Sharaa

Sharaa is to appoint 70 representatives out of the 210-member body. The other two-thirds will be selected by local committees appointed by the electoral commission, which itself was appointed by Sharaa.
But southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province, which suffered sectarian bloodshed in July, and the country’s Kurdish-held northeast are excluded from the process for now as they are outside Damascus’s control, and their 32 seats will remain empty.
“I support the authorities and I’m ready to defend them, but these aren’t real elections,” said Louay al-Arfi, 77, a retired civil servant sitting with friends at a Damascus cafe.
“It’s a necessity in the transitional phase, but we want direct elections” to follow, he said.
Under a temporary constitution announced in March, the incoming parliament will exercise legislative functions until a permanent constitution is adopted and new elections are held.
Sharaa has said it would be impossible to organise direct elections now, noting the large number of Syrians who lack documentation after millions fled abroad or were displaced internally during the civil war.
Final list likely to be out today
Around 6,000 people are taking part in Sunday’s selection process.
Preliminary results are expected to emerge after it ends, with state TV reporting that some centres started counting the votes.
The final list of names is due to be announced on Monday.
Under the rules, candidates must not be “supporters of the former regime” and must not promote secession or partition. Those running include Syrian-American Henry Hamra, the first Jewish candidate since the 1940s.
“The next parliament faces significant responsibilities, including signing and ratifying international agreements. This will lead Syria into a new phase, and it is a major responsibility,” said Hala al-Qudsi, Damascus’s electoral committee member running for a seat herself.
She was focused on the ongoing talks between Syria and Israel, stating that she would “say ‘no’ to any security agreement with Israel that does not serve the interests of the Syrian people”.
In September, Sharaa voiced hope for a security agreement with Israel.
Rights groups have criticised the selection process, saying it concentrates power in Sharaa’s hands and lacks representation for the country’s ethnic and religious minorities.
In a joint statement last month, more than a dozen groups said the process means Sharaa “can effectively shape a parliamentary majority composed of individuals he selected or ensured loyalty from”.

The government initiative follows Thursday’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester.
A pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London went ahead on Saturday despite pleas from Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the capital’s Metropolitan Police to delay it.
The government said police would be authorised to consider the “cumulative impact” of protests when deciding to impose limits on protesters.

London witnesses huge rally despite Starmer’s appeal for postponement

“The right to protest is a fundamental freedom in our country. However, this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement.
Over 1,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London’s Trafalgar Square with nearly 500 people arrested for showing supporting for the banned Palestine Action campaign group.
Organisers rejected calls not to gather saying they “stood in solidarity” with the Jewish community over the Manchester attack but that “cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win”.
A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed at a vigil for the Jewish victims of the synagogue attack.
“Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes,” Mahmood claimed.
“This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community.” Questioned by a BBC television interviewer about the Jewish community’s repeated warnings about the dangers they face, Mahmood admitted she was “very worried about the state of community relations in our country”.
The home secretary added, speaking to Times Radio, that there was a broad “problem of a rise not only in anti-Semitism but in other forms of hatred as well”.
“There are clearly malign and dark forces running amok across our country,” she asserted
Police shot dead assailant Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old UK citizen of Syrian descent, within minutes of the alarm being raised on Thursday.
One person died in the attack outside the synagogue in north Manchester.
Another died after suffering a fatal gunshot, believed by police to have been fired by armed officers as they tackled Shamie.
Three people who were seriously injured remain in hospital, including one who is also believed to have been accidentally hit by police fire.
Counter terrorism police have been granted more time to detain four people arrested on suspicion of terrorism-linked offences over the incident.

CAIRO: Hamas on Sunday called for a swift start to a prisoner exchange with Israel, as negotiators from both sides prepare to meet in Egypt today (Monday) for crucial talks aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long Israeli invasion of Gaza.
Foreign ministers of several countries, including Egypt, said the talks were a “real opportunity” to achieve a sustainable ceasefire.
“Hamas is very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions,” a senior official told AFP.
The diplomatic push follows the group’s flexible response to US President Donald Trump’s roadmap to end the fighting and secure the release of captives held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Ahead of the discussions in Egypt, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza.
“You can’t release (prisoners) in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop,” Rubio told CBS News. “There can’t be a war going on in the middle of it.”
Negotiators are due to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing the hope that the prisoners could be released within days.
Cairo confirmed it would be hosting a delegation from Hamas for talks on “the ground conditions and details of the exchange of all Israeli detainees and Palestinian prisoners”.
The White House said Trump had also sent two envoys to Egypt — his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff.
“During communications with mediators, Hamas insisted that it is essential for Israel to halt military operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip, cease all air, reconnaissance, and drone activity, and withdraw from inside Gaza City,” a Palestinian source close to Hamas said, adding that the group would “also halt their military operations” in parallel.
 
 

According to Trump’s plan, in return for the prisoners, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences and more than 1,700 detainees from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after the war began.
‘Complete obliteration’
But Trump has warned he will “not tolerate delay” from Hamas, urging the group to move quickly towards a deal “or else all bets will be off”.
“When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he posted on Truth Social.
He also said Hamas will face “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to give up power and control of Gaza, Reuters reported.
When asked if Netanyahu is on board with ending the bombing in Gaza and supporting the US’ broader vision, Trump told CNN on Saturday, “Yes on Bibi.”
In the interview that aired on Sunday, Trump added that he expects to soon know whether Hamas is committed to peace.
He also said talks on implementing a truce for Gaza will take days. “They’re in negotiations right now as we speak. They’ve started the negotiations. It’ll last a couple of days,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see how it turns out. But I’m hearing it’s going very well,” he added.
Strikes continue
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on Gaza, in spite of the US calls for a pause. Footage showed thick smoke billowing over the skyline over the coastal territory on Sunday.
Gaza’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, said Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza on Sunday, after several attacks through the night.
“The decision to occupy Gaza, the collapse of multi-storey buildings, and the intensity of IDF operations in the city have led to the evacuation of roughly 900,000 residents to the south, creating immense pressure on Hamas and the countries that support it,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a speech on Sunday.
 
 

The UN estimates that around one million people were living in the area before the assault began.
“There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of air strikes (since last night). The tanks and military vehicles have slightly pulled back, but I believe this is a tactical move, not a withdrawal,” said Muin Abu Rajab, 40, a resident of Al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City.
Hayya appears on TV
Before arriving at Cairo, Hamas’ top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya broke his silence during a pre-recorded statement that aired in Qatar overnight, in his first televised appearance since Israel targeted him and other leaders of the group in Doha last month.
The Hamas leader remained defiant in the interview, saying he drew no distinction between those killed in the attack on Doha, including his son, and the tens of thousands who have died during the nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza.
“We hope that their blood will pave the way to victory, the way to Jerusalem, the way to the disgrace of the occupation, and the way to the dignity and triumph of the nation,” he said in the video aired by Al Araby Television Network in Qatar.
Hope for sustainable ceasefire
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of several Islamic countries on Sunday welcomed the latest developments over Gaza, affirming that these represented a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in the Gaza Strip, APP reported.
Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza, said a joint statement of the foreign ministers, shared by the foreign office spokesperson with the media.
The foreign ministers also welcomed the US president’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and to begin implementation of the exchange agreement. They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region.
They also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Com­mittee of independent technocrats.
Pakistani citizens
Also on Sunday, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was actively engaged with its international partners to ensure the safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens who were illegally detained by the Israeli occupying forces.
In response to media inquiries concerning Pakistani nationals aboard the Sumud flotilla, the spokesperson said in a statement, “Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health.”
 
 

He added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, Senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”

• Supplier continued delivery to other industries, made ‘dubious’ force majeure claims to escape accountability
ISLAMABAD: Electricity consumers in Pakistan are having to shoulder a financial burden of nearly Rs215 million, mainly due to regulatory weaknesses, it has emerged.
While the capacity trap, currency devaluation and exch­ange-rate volatility are touted as the main factors behind expensive electricity, similar attention is not paid to issues of weak contract enforcement and inadequate regulatory oversight, which are actually forcing consumers to foot the bill for contractual default by private companies.
 
 

In the latest episode that has come to light, a Punjab-based coal power plant faced a significant contractual default by its long-term supplier.
Subsequent decisions by regulators such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) allowed the resulting financial burden to be passed directly on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs.
This is just one example of persistent weaknesses in the coal procurement process, which previously made headlines earlier this year, sparking inquiries and leading to partial improvements. However, the issue is far from resolved and continues to add to the public’s financial strain.
Dawn reached out to Nepra with a set of questions on Sept 22. Over the following weeks, the regulator repeatedly promised a written response, but failed to provide one until going to press.
Default on coal supply
The issue at hand stems from the breach of a long-term coal supply agreement between the power plant and its coal supplier in December last year. The contract, awarded through a competitive process, secured a substantial discount of $2.51 per tonne on API-4 specification coal.
This was seen as an improvement over a previously-challenged contract, which only offered a discount of $0.50 per tonne.
However, the supplier defa­ulted on its obligation to del­iver coal against issued purchase orders, citing an alleged ‘force majeure’ as the basis for its non-performance, referencing factors such as congestion at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa and, notably, the India-Pakistan conflagration in May.
The claim regarding terminal congestion is noteworthy, as industry experts routinely consider this risk as a foreseeable trade challenge in the international coal market.
However, the use of the India-Pakistan flare-up as an excuse does not hold up, as documentation indicates that other suppliers successfully fulfilled their contractual obligations during the same timeframe.
Additionally, other industries in Pakistan continued to import coal without interruption, raising questions over the enormity of the supplier’s ‘force majeure’ claims.
Interestingly, while it defaulted on the long-term contract with the power plant, the company continued to supply coal to other industries, suggesting the decision was linked to the high discount offered rather than the self-proclaimed ‘force majeure’.
Cost increases
As a direct consequence of the default, the power plant in question was forced to procure replacement coal from the next-ranked supplier, at a significantly higher price. This resulted in an additional cost of $1.86 per tonne being incurred.
When applied to the total defaulted quantity of nearly 372,000 tonnes across eight vessels, this nonperformance by the original supplier generated a verifiable loss of $691,931, equivalent to around Rs197m.
The regulatory response by Nepra solidified the public’s exposure to this financial loss. In its Fuel Cost Adjustment decision of June 26, 2025, the authority green-lit passing the full impact of the Rs197m cost directly into consumer tariff, instead of protecting consumers’ interests by holding the defaulting party accountable, as explicitly outlined in the Coal Supply Agreement.
The contract stipulates that the defaulting party must bear the incremental cost of replacement coal and forfeit its performance guarantee to cover such losses. According to records, the supplier’s performance guarantee was not forfeited, and the recovery of the $691,931 loss was not enforced by either CPPA-G or Nepra.
Despite its ongoing default, the same company was allowed to continue supplying under the long-term tender and participate in, and win, a spot tender for the same plant again on June 11, 2025.
This spot tender secured a discount of only $1.58 per tonne, which was 93 cents per tonne lower than the discount on the defaulted long-term contract. The price disparity created an additional loss of $55,800, about Rs16m, on a single 60,000-tonne supply, placing yet more burden on consumers.
The CPPA-G’s issuance of NOC to the defaulting supplier, both for the spot tender and its continued long-term supplies, illustrates the absence of an effective systemic penalty framework.
Following an earlier episode, a Nepra fact-finding committee had identified “anomalies” in the coal procurement process. The committee’s subsequent report underscored the structural weaknesses inherent in the system, which led to single-bidder scenarios and limited competition.
The report had also acknowledged the absence of requisite regulatory guidelines for long-term coal procurement and recommended the urgent creation of an independent coal regulator to protect consumers from unjustified costs. But even after the passage of eight months, those recommendations remain unenforced.

The incident came the same day as a separate attack on a religious leader left at least five people injured.
According to police, Judge Malik Inayatur Rehman and his security staff came under fire from unidentified assailants near Khari City Hospital.
The judge’s vehicle was hit by at least 12 bullets, but all occupants survived the ambush.
Law enforcement agencies reached the site soon afterwards and cordoned off the area for investigation.
Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan took notice of the attack and directed the home secretary, inspector general of police, and other law enforcement authorities to tighten security across the city.
He instructed them that those involved in the attack be dealt with “iron hands” and brought to justice. The chief minister also urged citizens to remain peaceful and united to foil the designs of elements seeking to disturb the region’s peace.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah also condem­ned the attack and called for a transparent investigation. Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, Deputy Speaker Sadia Danish, Opposition Lea­der Kazim Mesum, lawyers’ representatives, and civil society members also denounced the incident.
Religious leader attacked
Earlier in the day, a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) was also targeted near the Central Police Office (CPO).
Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire.
According to a GB government statement, Maul­ana Nisar, his driver, and three police personnel assigned to his security sustained injuries.
Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices.
 
 

CCTV footage showed the assailants fleeing in a Suzuki vehicle they allegedly snatched at gunpoint after their own vehicles became inoperative.
The injured were shifted to a hospital for medical treatment, where their condition was reported to be stable.
Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Protests erupt
Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest.
Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region.
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation.
In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.”
The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said.
Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits.
Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.

However, the opposition PTI has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
US Strategic Metals (USSM), which signed an MoU with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
Sources in Washington hope this will pave the way for Pakistan’s formal entry into the global supply chain for critical minerals, a sector of growing importance for global industries and national security.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MOU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”
USSM CEO Stacy W. Hastie said the first delivery “opens an exciting chapter of collaboration between USSM and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organisation, aimed at expanding trade and deepening friendship between our two countries.”
For Pakistan, the agreement offers a gateway into the global critical minerals economy, with the potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue, create jobs, and promote technology transfer.
 
 

The country’s mineral wealth is often estimated at around $6 trillion, placing it among the world’s most resource-rich nations.
For the US, the partnership promises access to key raw materials while reducing reliance on external monopolies that dominate the global minerals market.
Disclose secret deals
But not everyone is convinced that this and other similar deals will be a boon for Pakistan. In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram demanded the government to disclose details of alleged secret deals with the United States.
Referring to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington, the spokesperson warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Mr Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests.”
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.
He urged the government to learn from the “disastrous consequences” of Mughal Emperor Jahangir’s 1615 decision to grant trading rights to the British at Surat Port, which he said ultimately led to colonial control.
Commenting on simmering political tensions between the PPP and PML-N, Mr Akram stated that the public disagreements were a “well-thought-out plan” to “divert public attention from chronic national issues”.

Yet, despite years of visibility and repeated campaigns, the disease remains a worsening crisis in Pakistan. The country is often cited as having among the highest breast cancer incidence rates in Asia: one in nine women is at risk in her lifetime. GLOBOCAN 2020 reported over 25,000 new cases in Pakistan, while advocacy groups estimate up to 90,000 annually, with some 40,000 deaths. Studies estimate an annual rise of over 5pc in cases. If awareness alone were enough, these numbers would not be climbing. The problem lies in the gap between knowing and acting. A comprehensive review of studies found that only about a third of Pakistani women have meaningful knowledge of breast cancer, and even fewer practise self-exams or undergo mammograms. Myths persist, particularly in rural areas, where stigma, male gatekeeping, and the absence of female doctors delay diagnosis. More than 70pc of cases are still detected at stages III or IV, when treatment is costly and survival rates collapse. Early detection offers over 80pc five-year survival, compared to less than 20pc in advanced stages of the disease. For families — and the already overburdened health system — late diagnosis is ruinously expensive.
Breast cancer must therefore be reframed as a national emergency, not just an annual awareness theme. That means universal, subsidised screening; Urdu- and regional-language campaigns that reach beyond urban elites into rural communities; and sustained investment in female health workers who can overcome cultural barriers. Employers, too, must play their part, offering workplace screening, paid medical leave, and support for women undergoing treatment. Pink ribbons may start conversations, but they will not stop this epidemic. Only when awareness is matched by decisive action — structural, financial and social — will the tide truly begin to turn.
