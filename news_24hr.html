Rescuers were racing to find 38 missing people in rough seas after the vessel carrying 65 passengers sank before midnight on Wednesday as it sailed to the popular holiday destination from Indonesia’s main island Java.
“23 rescued, 4 dead,” Rama Samtama Putra, police chief of Banyuwangi in East Java, where the boat departed, told AFP.
President Prabowo Subianto, who was on a trip to Saudi Arabia, ordered an immediate emergency response, cabinet secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya said in a statement on Thursday, adding the cause of the accident was “bad weather”.
Java-based Surabaya search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit confirmed the same figures in a statement, and said efforts to reach the boat were initially hampered by adverse weather conditions that have since cleared up.
Waves as high as 2.5 metres with “strong winds and strong currents” had affected the rescue operation, he said.
The agency had earlier said 61 people were missing and four rescued, without giving a cause for the boat’s sinking.
“KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya… sank about 25 minutes after weighing anchor,” it said.
“The ferry’s manifest data totalled 53 passengers and 12 passenger crews.”
A rescue team of at least 54 personnel including from the navy and police were dispatched along with inflatable rescue boats, while a bigger vessel was later sent from Surabaya city to assist the search efforts.
The ferry crossing from Ketapang port in Java’s Banyuwangi regency to Bali’s Gilimanuk port — one of the busiest in Indonesia — is around 5 kilometres as the crow flies and takes around one hour.
It is often used by people crossing between the islands by car.
 
 

Four of the known survivors saved themselves by using the ferry’s lifeboat and were found in the water early on Thursday, the rescue agency said.
It said the ferry was also transporting 22 vehicles, including 14 trucks. It was unclear if any foreigners were onboard when the ferry sank.
Accidents common
Rescuers said they were still assessing if there were more people onboard than the ferry’s manifest showed.
It is common in Indonesia for the actual number of passengers on a boat to differ from the manifest.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards and sometimes due to bad weather.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
A ferry carrying more than 800 people ran aground in shallow waters off East Nusa Tenggara province in 2022 and remained stuck for two days before being dislodged with no one hurt.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra island.</p><small>2025-07-03 06:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612151-calls-within-pti-for-dialogue-with-powerful-quarters-grow-stronger' target='_blank'><strong>Calls within PTI for dialogue with ‘powerful quarters' grow stronger</strong></a><br><p>

Rover finds a clue</strong></a><br><p>PARIS: Why is Mars barren and uninhabitable, while life has always thrived here on our relatively similar planet Earth? A discovery made by a Nasa rover has offered a clue for this mystery, new research said on Wednesday, suggesting that while rivers once sporadically flowed on Mars, it was doomed to mostly be a desert planet.
Mars is thought to currently have all the necessary ingredients for life except for perhaps the most important one: liquid water. However, the red surface is carved out by ancient rivers and lakes, showing that water once flowed on our nearest neighbour.
There are currently several rovers searching Mars for signs of life that could have existed back in those more habitable times, millions of years ago.
Earlier this year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover discovered a missing piece in this puzzle: rocks that are rich in carbonate minerals. These  “carbonates” — such as limestone on Earth — act as a sponge for carbon dioxide, pulling it in from the atmosphere and trapping it in rock.
A new study, published in the journal Nature, modelled exactly how the existence of these rocks could change our understanding of Mars’s past.
Brief ‘oases’
Lead study author Edwin Kite, a planetary scientist at the University of Chicago and a member of the Curiosity team, said it appeared there were  “blips of habitability in some times and places” on Mars. But these  “oases” were the exception rather than the rule.
On Earth, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet. Over long timescales, the carbon becomes trapped in rocks such as carbonates. Then, volcanic eruptions spew the gas back into the atmosphere, creating a well-balanced climate cycle supportive of consistently running water.
However, Mars has a “feeble” rate of volcanic outgassing compared to Earth, Kite said. This throws off the balance, leaving Mars much colder and less hospitable.
According to the modelling research, the brief periods of liquid water on Mars were followed by 100 million years of barren desert — a long time for anything to survive.
It is still possible that there are pockets of liquid water deep underground on Mars we have not yet found, Kite said. Nasa’s Perseverance Rover, which landed on an ancient Martian delta in 2021, has also found signs of carbonates at the edge of dried-up lake, he added. Next, the scientists hope to discover more evidence of carbonates.
Kite said the best proof would be returning rock samples from the Martian surface back to Earth — both the United States and China are racing to do this in the next decade.
Are we alone?
Ultimately, scientists are searching for an answer to one of the great questions: how common are planets like Earth that can harbour life? Astronomers have discovered nearly 6,000 planets beyond our Solar System since the early 1990s. But only for Mars and Earth can scientists study rocks which allow them to understand the planet’s past, Kite said.
If we do determine that Mars never hosted even tiny micro-organisms during its watery times, that would indicate it is difficult to kick-start life across the universe.
But if we discover proof of ancient life, that would  “basically be telling us the origin of life is easy on a planetary scale,” Kite said.

In an advisory issued to the deputy commissioners across the province, the PDMA quoted the Pakistan Meteorological Department as revealing that moist currents are penetrating into most parts of the region and likely to intensify in the next couple of days.
“A westerly wave is also expected to approach on July 5 evening and night. Under the influence of the new weather system, showers along with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds, with isolated and scattered heavy rainfalls, are expected in Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Kolai-Pallas, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and North and South Waziristan from July 5 to 11 with occasional gaps,” it said.
The PDMA warned that heavy to very heavy rains could generate flash floods in nullahs and streams of Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Abbottabad, Buner, Bajaur, Battagram, Buner, Hangu, Torghar, Haripur, Karak, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Khyber, Kohat, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Shangla, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Tank during the forecast period.

Urges authorities to take measures to minimise damage

It also said that urban flooding was very likely to happen in low-lying areas of Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan, while there’s a likelihood of riverine flooding in Chitral, Swat, Panjkora and Kabul rivers.
According to the PDMA, landslides may cause roads closure in the vulnerable hilly areas of Abbottabad, Battagram, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Khyber, Kohistan, Kolai-Pallas Kohistan, Kurram, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Shangla, Swat, Torghar and North Waziristan districts.
Also, heavy rainfall and windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the period.
The PDMA urged deputy commissioners of all districts to take all precautionary measures against downpours and floods to minimise damage to public life and property and livestock.
It also asked authorities to assess and plan deployment of additional resources and exercise control over traffic leading to and in the vicinity of vulnerable and tourist areas and securing by physical means and keeping people away from loose structures such as buildings under construction, advertisement hoardings, electric poles and solar panels to prevent damages and save lives.
In the advisory, the PDMA said authorities should keep monitoring rivers, streams, local and rainfed nullahs, ensure drainage systems are clear from obstacles to facilitate the efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding, coordinate with relevant municipal administrations to ensure mitigation and preparedness measures for landslides and urban flooding, and secure or remove billboards and hoardings in view of wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It urged farmers to take all necessary measures to prevent damage to their crops.
The PDMA said cattle and sheep herders should undertake necessary mitigating and precautionary measures to protect their livestock from wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It said that people travelling on provincial and national highways in at-risk and affected areas should be forewarned of adverse conditions and detoured to safe waiting areas under guidance of authorities, national highway and motorway police, law-enforcement agencies.
The PDMA asked people to seek shelter in safe areas such as sturdy buildings or underground structures during wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms and avoid objects that posed a risk of failing or being struck by lightning.
It stressed the need for the availability of emergency services personnel and equipment in areas at high risk of urban and flash flooding and landslides, immediate stocking of basic commodities like medicines in regions that are likely to be cut off from other regions during landslides.

German alpinist David Göttler made his way down via paraglider, while the French duo of Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein etched themselves into the history books by skiing down the peak, nicknamed ‘The Killer Mountain’.
 
 

CEO of Adventure Tours Pakistan Naiknaam Karim told Dawn that the three foreign climbers began their summit attempt on Nanga Parbat, via the Schell route.
The trio climbed from the approximately 3,600-metre-high base camp to the summit between June 21 and 24.
Göttler, 47, had planned to descend from the top by paraglider.
However, upon reaching the summit, strong winds forced him to launch his paraglider from 7,700 metres instead. He successfully flew from that altitude and landed at base camp in 30 minutes, according to the organisers.
Michael Beek, a German tour operator, mountain guide, and paragliding instructor, congratulated Göttler in a Facebook post, writing that Göttler had made a historic first.
“Summiting Nanga Parbat in alpine style with Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein was incredible; but to be able to fly down from 7,700m all the way back to base camp on the same day has brought my joy to the next level,” he said.
Meanwhile, his French companions, Duperier and Langenstein, camped the night at 7,625m, and later skied and trekked down the massive Rupal Face, which rises 4,600 meters from base camp, arriving three days later.
Theirs is considered the first ski descent of the Rupal Face, and a first from the summit of Nanga Parbat.

A Pakistani delegation, headed by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, reached Washington this week, hoping to secure a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would avert the reimposition of a 29 per cent US tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. The tariff relief was temporarily paused earlier this year, but a final decision hinges on the outcome of the ongoing talks.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that Washington may allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful progress is visible, potentially pushing the cutoff toward Labour Day. However, Pakistani officials say they are working to complete the deal this week to remove any uncertainty for exporters and investors.
The proposed framework includes increased Pakistani imports of US goods — particularly crude oil — alongside incentives for American investment in Pakistan’s mining, infrastructure, and energy sectors. Key projects under discussion include the Reko Diq copper-gold mine and associated energy infrastructure. The agreement is also expected to pave the way for greater engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Pakistani negotiators are optimistic that a deal can be finalised this week, ensuring continued access to the US market.

• Experts say Karachi is surrounded by several active and dormant fault lines, can’t withstand even a moderate intensity tremor
• Call for equipping people with a life-saving knowledge and tools, as well as ensuring strict enforcement of building codes
• Need stressed for imposing ban on unauthorised extraction of groundwater
KARACHI: While the recent seismic activity affecting parts of the city seems to have settled down to an extent, indicating what some experts describe as an “increasing stability” of the reactivated fault line after release of built-up energy, a sense of unease still exists in the people, who repeatedly experienced low-intensity tremors for over three weeks in June, it has emerged.
Speaking to Dawn, the residents of Quaidabad, Landhi and Malir — the localities most affected by a series of low-intensity tremors starting from June 1 and ending on June 22 — say that that the fear of being hit by a potentially a high intensity earthquake constantly grips their hearts.
“We no longer live a normal life. The very thought of being struck by a disaster wakes me several times at night. Last night, too, I felt slight shaking; first at 3am and then at 4.45am. But, there was no official confirmation. I think the tremors were too minor to be recorded,” said Bashir Ahmed Mirjat, local journalist and resident of Umer Marvi Goth, Quaidabad.
According to him, the situation has been extremely disturbing over the last month. On every seismic event, people used to come out on streets, praying for their safety, and then returning to their chores.
“It was a continued state of absolute helplessness. Every day, seemed like the end of life. I can say with certainty that I felt more than 40 tremors — including the first one of 3.6magnitude — in 22 days. Their high frequency badly affected people’s mental health.”
Like Mijrat, who moved to the locality in Karachi three years back, many villagers have had their lives’ first encounter with persistent seismic events. Shocked and panicked, some of them returned to their hometowns.
Faiza Shahzaib, teacher and resident of Landhi, heard a loud and intense sound followed by a tremor just two weeks ago. “It forced all of us to come out on the street. It was the second time that people had to leave their homes out of fear following an earthquake last month. Still, we are too scared.”
Residents believe that their fears stem from the missing role of the state as well as the absence of provision of information by official sources.
Shazia Nadeem, Shahzaib’s colleague residing in the Muslimabad area of Malir City for over five decades, says, “People rely on whatever is being presented on the social media these days, which at times constitute misinformation. Till today, there is no government initiative to inform, educate and train (in disaster preparedness) those living in the quake-vulnerable areas. Hence, most of us don’t know what to do if God forbid, a disaster strikes.”
The residents, from the information gathered from the social media, also link the prolonged seismic activity directly with the excessive withdrawal of groundwater in their localities, which has been facing an acute shortage of piped water for decades. The situation, they believe, is also causing their land to sink.
Sharing data of the city’s low-intensity tremors, Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder Leghari, who has done a postgraduate diploma in seismology from Japan, said that the historical data showed that mild to moderate tremors had been recorded in Karachi from time to time since the 1960s.
Life amidst fault lines
Karachi, experts say, is surrounded by several active and dormant fault lines, and the recent seismic events — a total of 57 low-intensity tremors in 22 days in the month of June this year — are consistent with the region’s natural tectonic movements.
“The Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir areas are located near active fault lines, making them more to vulnerable to seismic events. Minor earthquakes may pre-empt high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the Landhi fault,” explains Mr Asif Rana, former director of the Geological Survey of Pakistan.
According to him, the city’s close proximity to several seismic faults, including the Allahbund fault, which runs parallel to Sindh’s coast, and the junction of the Indian, Arabian and Eurasian plates, makes it susceptible to natural seismic activity.
“While the triple junction hasn’t witnessed a major earthquake since 1945, geologists think that substantial seismic energy has been accumulating in the region, making the area increasingly vulnerable to a significant quake,” he said, adding that if such an event occurs under the seabed near Sonmiani, which is only 50km away, it could potentially generate a tsunami that could hit Karachi, too.
Tsunami-generating earthquakes in the region, he says, have been reported as early as 1881.  Two offshore earthquakes – one of 8-magnitude reported in 1945 and the other in 1947 of 7.3-magnitude – generated tsunamis, which hit Sindh and Makran coastal areas.
Karachi, Mr Rana points out, is located on the edge of a stable crust of the western rifted margin of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, which is creating continuous stress on its rifted western margin, resulting in re-activation of the dormant faults.
“The Landhi fault has become active recently after several decades and is currently going through a normalisation phase. Another nearby fault close to Thano Bulah Khan had also contributed to the last month’s seismic events.”
Asked about the possible link between the recent 5.5-magnitude quake in Musakhel, Balochistan, and Karachi’s seismic events, he said there are no indication that these events are triggering each other as Karachi’s seismic activity is considered localised.
“We must remember, though, that all these events are part of the same regional tectonic framework. This swarm is regarded as normal, not a precursor to a major quake. The region is prone to significant earthquakes, including the devastating 1935 Quetta earthquake of 7.7magnintude, which killed over 35,000 people.”
An analysis of the 57 low-intensity tremors shows the majority (33) were recorded in areas close to Malir. Other areas where tremors were felt were: Quaidabad, Landhi, Gadap, DHA City and DHA Karachi and Korangi. There were 10 tremors on June 2 followed by a dozen the next day.
The last six tremors — four of them had above three-magnitude — were recorded on June 22.  “But, what is unusual this time was their high frequency in a single month. Having said that, the city has never seen a major earthquake,” he said.
Both experts endorse the possibility of the city seeing more low-intensity tremors, given the fact that the region is seismically active.
They also call for equipping people in the vulnerable areas with the life-saving knowledge tools required to face a potentially high intensity earthquake as well as ensuring the strict enforcement of building codes.
“It’s time that the authorities take the situation seriously. The haphazard way Karachi has grown over the years is a recipe for disaster as even a moderate intensity tremor (between 4 and 5.5 magnitude) can cause havoc in densely populated areas,” Mr Rana says.
Highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of the fault lines, already known, and mapped, Mr Moin Raza Khan, former head of Pakistan Petroleum Limited, says that tectonic movements definitely disturb the skin of the earth, causing damage to the infrastructure under and above the ground.
“When the earth moves, it readjusts itself and then stays calm. This is called re-equilibration. We need to monitor our fault lines and take steps to keep our infrastructure in and above the ground secured, ensuring the safety of human life and investment,” he says.
‘Sinking’ city
On the link between the extraction of underground water and tremors, senior marine geologist Dr Asif Inam, also the former head of the National Institute of Oceanography, explained that Karachi, like many other coastal cities worldwide, relies heavily on groundwater for both domestic and industrial purposes.
Unregulated withdrawal, he points out, typically leads to the extraction of water beyond the aquifers’ recharge capacity. This often results in the compaction and readjustment of subsurface soil, leading to the subsidence of adjacent land. This land subsidence, he says, can also facilitate faults running parallel to the Karachi’s coastline.
“There is an urgent need to ban unauthorised water withdrawal in Karachi, as coastal areas are already at risk from rising sea levels. Any subsidence in these regions could exacerbate the situation, particularly since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted a sea level rise of approximately 60 centimetres along Karachi’s coast by the end of the century.”
Dr Inam underscored the need for a comprehensive coastal zone management plan for Karachi to protect strategic infrastructure from the impacts of climate change and related coastal hazards.
“It is essential to continuously monitor changes using modern geodetic techniques, such as InSAR [Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar] and GPS [Global Positioning System] measurements, to detect even minor changes in ground elevation that could affect infrastructure or increase flood risk,” he said.

What’s next for the Middle East?</strong></a><br><p>The recent Iran-Israel direct military confrontation, and the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities have sparked a geopolitical rebalancing across the wider Middle East. From Islamabad to Ankara, capitals across West Asia are urgently rethinking their strategies after the dramatic events of the past two weeks. Every actor with a stake in the region’s decades-long conflicts is now re-evaluating its position and seeking to understand where the major powers and other regional countries stand. Most crucially, the lessons that Tehran and Tel Aviv draw from this showdown will shape the emerging power dynamics across the region.
From Tehran to Tel Aviv — major takeaways
The 12-day war catapulted the simmering covert and proxy battles between the two sides into a direct war of attrition, the first for Iran since the Iran-Iraq War. For three decades, the Islamic Republic had relied on various militias in its protracted conflict with both Israel and the US. But as the war came home — with direct Israeli attacks and targeted US strikes on Iran’s prized nuclear facilities — the absence of a capable air force able to defend Iran’s skies became evident.
 
 

Although this may be an outcome of decades-long sanctions that have constrained Iran’s military procurements, the fact that the Iranian air force did not engage Israeli fighter jets when they entered its airspace has significant implications for the post-ceasefire rebuilding of its nuclear enterprise. Tehran will have to factor in Israel’s air superiority as it seeks ways to regain control of its skies.
Politically, Iran now faces its most existential question: should it seek a nuclear shield to ensure the security of the regime?
 


For nearly three decades, Iranian leaders have toyed with the notion of ‘nuclear latency’ or ‘nuclear threshold’ — that is, putting in place the building blocks of a nuclear capability that would enable them to sprint toward a nuclear weapon whenever a political decision is made. US and Israeli strikes have sought to neutralise one of the bomb pathways — uranium enrichment — in which Iran has invested over the past decade. The extent of the setbacks to Iranian nuclear facilities is not yet known.
Conversely, for Tel Aviv, the shifting political goalposts posed a challenge to its military strategy. Moving from merely disrupting Iran’s nuclear pursuits to seeking regime change limited the Israeli military’s ability to achieve its objectives solely through air power and by sowing discord within Iran’s decision-making structures. This shift also unnerved the Gulf neighbours of both Iran and Israel, as it revived memories of the 2003 Iraq war.
Yet, as the aggressor, Israel could not unilaterally strike the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant and had to rely on Washington to carry out the attack. This dependency grants the Trump administration political leverage over Israel as it seeks to enforce the Israel-Iran ceasefire, and especially, ensure Israel’s compliance.
Beyond this, Israel now views itself as the predominant military hegemon across the Middle East; a perception that could spark unease in other regional capitals wary of a risk-taking Israel, potentially triggering inter-state wars rather than just conflicts with militant groups.
Nervous Gulf
During the 12-day war, the most anxious leaders were in the Gulf region. For decades, the Gulf states had relied on the American security umbrella and their political influence in Washington to advance their political and security interests. During this time, both the Gulf states and Israel perceived a common threat from Iran’s regional ambitions.
Yet, in recent years, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had found ways to stabilise ties with Iran and pursue coexistence. That delicate balance has now been disturbed by the war, as the Gulf faces a new threat: Iran’s warnings of attacks on US bases across the region.
Post-ceasefire, the Gulf now faces several daunting scenarios:

Preparing for a nuclear-armed Iran
Coexisting with a weakened regime in Tehran that may seek to reassert its position, sparking further instability
Bracing for the next war, as Israel’s risk-acceptance threshold has increased
Pursuing geopolitical balancing by deepening engagements with Tehran, Moscow, and Beijing

During the war, Israel’s ambition of regime change unnerved Gulf leaders. As much as the Gulf states oppose a nuclear-armed Iran, it is the possibility of a civil conflict that puts regional leaders on edge. How can a stable political transition be achieved in a country with nearly half a million trained soldiers, where any power vacuum could result in a bloody civil war? Would Israeli or American forces actually commit to fighting on the ground to support opposition groups? And if civil unrest erupts, how can Iran’s stockpile of nuclear materials and technology be effectively secured?
 
 

Gulf countries, and Iran’s other neighbours, dread the prospect of prolonged internal unrest in Iran, as it could embolden centrifugal forces across the region. Moreover, political instability in Iran would likely lead to an exodus of people toward the Gulf and Europe, while triggering a new wave of militant violence.
The great powers: Limits of influence?
For the great powers — the US, Russia and China — the evolving geopolitics of the Middle East is crucial for their global strategies. For the US, which is both an actor in the current conflict and an external power influencing regional dynamics, the key challenge is to avoid new entanglement in the Middle East.
Washington’s primary strategic focus remains the Indo-Pacific, and a prolonged conflict in the Middle East would only serve as an unwelcome distraction. For now, the United States’ main interest lies in maintaining a weakened, non-nuclear Iran, which would allow its Gulf partners to deepen their ties with Israel. Both Washington broadly, and the Trump administration specifically, have backed a Middle East shaped by the Abraham Accords — promoting normalisation between Israel and key Arab states, while largely sidestepping the divisive issue of Palestine.
This vision of peace is intended to enable Washington’s Gulf security partners, working in coordination with Israel, to take greater responsibility for regional security. In turn, this would allow the United States to reallocate military resources to the Asia-Pacific, where it is increasingly focused on countering China. However, Washington believes that a nuclear-capable Iran would inevitably undermine this regional order.
Conversely, for Russia and China — whose absence from the current war was striking — the situation posed a strategic paradox. On the one hand, a distracted United States mired in Middle Eastern conflicts benefits both Beijing and Moscow; on the other, it comes at the cost of weakening their key regional partner, Iran.
For different reasons, both powers chose to remain on the sidelines — Russia is bogged down by the war in Ukraine, while China, focused on maintaining economic stability amid an intensifying trade war with the US, has little appetite for external entanglements. As a result, neither provided Tehran with concrete military support nor acted to dissuade Washington from targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities.
 
 

Yet, both great powers cannot allow Israel to dominate the Middle East in ways that would entrench a US-led regional order at the expense of their own influence. Post ceasefire, China and Russia are likely to prioritise stabilising Iran and gradually rebuilding its economy and military capabilities, so it can better defend itself in the future. The more pressing question is: will Beijing and Moscow support Tehran’s nuclear quest, if the latter decides to sprint towards a nuclear breakout?
Immediately, however, a prospective ceasefire in Gaza between Hamas and Israel, again brokered by the US, will calm regional tensions across the Middle East. If it materialises, it indicates that the Iran-Israel ceasefire will also hold, providing considerable room for direct US-Iran talks on nuclear and regional issues. Similarly, the Gaza ceasefire will provide a window for a regional initiative to shape the future of governance and security in Gaza, with active support from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Any tangible progress on Gaza will build momentum towards Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries joining the Abraham Accords, and in the process, effectively reshape the regional order.
For now, the many ‘unknown unknowns’ surrounding the current geopolitical conundrum in the Middle East make it a volatile flashpoint. But as the belligerents, regional nations, and great powers evaluate the war’s outcomes, the nuclear aspirants around the world are drawing a stark lesson: nuclear weapons remain the ultimate guarantor of state security.

According to reports circulating on social media, a ninth-grade student was allegedly abducted at gunpoint near Notkani Chowk in Matli. A complaint filed by her uncle, Majno Maharaj, at the Matli police station alleges that two armed men — Maqsood Dars and Manzoor Dars — forcibly entered the family’s home and abducted the girl, Shahneela, while two unidentified men waited outside in a white vehicle used for the abduction.
 
 

The victim’s family has expressed the fear that the girl is at imminent risk of being forcibly married to someone and converted — both of which are violations of the country’s law.
The suspect’s family has allegedly refused to return the girl despite the family’s appeals, it was stated.

SHRC urges law enforcers to ensure safety and recovery of 15-year-old

The SHRC has cited several legal provisions that criminalise the actions allegedly taken by the suspects.
It stated that Sections 365-B, 364-A, and 506 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) prohibit abduction, forced marriage, and threats. Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees religious freedom, rendering forced conversions unconstitutional.
The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and its associated Rules (2016) empower law enforcers to intervene in such cases, it said.
Specifically, Rule 8 mandates the rescue and recovery of child victims while Rule 9 authorises search warrants for missing children, it added.
Rule 10 provides for the temporary custody of rescued minors. Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows police to act pre-emptively in cognizable offenses.
Expressing grave concern, the SHRC highlighted the increasing number of cases involving child marriages and forced conversions among Hindu minorities in Sindh.
The commission described these incidents as serious violations of child rights, minority protections, and constitutional guarantees.
Under its powers vested by Section 4 (i) (ii) of the Sindh Protection of Human Rights Act, 2011, the SHRC has directed the authorities concerned to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a report through a competent officer before the Commission by July 7, 2025, at 11am.

Presiding over the meeting, Senator Mohsin Aziz criticised the absence of Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari, who was expected to respond to queries, particularly regarding independent power producers (IPPs) and their controversial contracts, which he described as unjust to the public.
Senator Shibli Faraz accused the Power Division of failing to address the ballooning circular debt and shifting the cost of inefficiency onto consumers. He said project costs were often inflated to benefit IPPs and lamented the lack of transparency. “The Power Division consistently avoids disclosing facts,” he said, as quoted in a statement from the Senate Secretariat.
Senator Aziz said the division’s continued deflection of responsibility to a Task Force was unacceptable, especially since the Task Force itself operates under the Power Division and remains answerable to it.

Senate panel demands accountability over circular debt and inflated IPP returns

Secretary Power Division Dr Fakhr-e-Alam Irfan informed the committee that repayment of circular debt had been linked to the debt servicing surcharge and assured that no additional burden would be passed on to consumers. He added that subsidies were being curtailed to help control debt accumulation.
Senator Aziz questioned why IPPs were granted excessively high returns and why no effort had been made to recover excess payments. He also demanded an explanation for the continued load-shedding despite the availability of surplus power.
The Secretary replied that outages were being carried out in areas with high electricity theft. He said overall losses had declined and efficiency had improved, with efforts underway to deploy theft-detection technology at the transformer level.
Senator Ponjo Bheel raised concerns about prolonged outages in Tharparkar, Matiari, and Umerkot, where load-shedding reportedly lasted up to 14 hours a day. He said residents in these areas were paying their bills yet remained without power. He also alleged corruption by local officials who took bribes for illegal connections and disconnected meters only to restore supply in exchange for further payments.
Following deliberations, the committee expressed displeasure over the Power Division’s failure to address key questions and directed that detailed responses be submitted in the next meeting.
Senator Haji Hidayatullah highlighted a billing issue in Peshawar, where a property that had been previously declared clear of dues by Pesco was later billed Rs 2.3 million. He alleged that Pesco officials offered to “settle” the bill for Rs300,000 in return for clearing it.
The Power Division secretary assured the committee the matter would be investigated.
K-Electric officials informed the committee that of their 2,100 feeders, load-shedding did not occur on 70pc, while 30pc faced outages due to high theft rates. They also noted that consumer bills were being broken into instalments to ease payment burdens.
The committee chairman proposed reviewing the strict electricity slab system and suggested switching to an annual average-based billing structure. The Secretary added that 58pc of consumers fell under the “protected” category, paying Rs10 per unit. He also highlighted the launch of a scheme that allows consumers to submit meter readings via a mobile app, with 500,000 downloads and 250,000 registrations to date.

A few things stand out.
First is the sharp increase in tax collections in FY25 despite very heavy headwinds. Revenue increases in a year of anaemic growth and slowing inflation are very hard to fetch, but they seem to have found a way to do it nonetheless, a fact the chairman went to great pains to highlight. In one of his public presentations, he showed that FBR tax collection increased by Rs2.4 trillion from last year.
The final figure was still below the target, despite the latter having been revised downward multiple times during the year. But that is not the big story here. That is a matter between the government and the IMF and does not really concern the rest of us.
What we have to ask is this: where did all this incremental tax revenue come from? The chairman has emphasised that this year much of the revenue increase was not due to what they call ‘autonomous growth’, which is revenue increase that comes from raw inflation and economic growth alone. That revenue increase does not lead to an increase in the ‘purchasing power’ of the government, since its spending rises correspondingly, especially when inflation is the driver of revenue growth.
This year, according to him, the bulk of the revenue increase came from what they call ‘new tax measures and rates’, as well as ‘improved compliance’. Between these two heads, something like Rs1.67tr was collected, according to FBR figures, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total incremental revenue collection.

Even the ‘people’s representatives’ were more worried about the rights of non-filers and fraudsters than of compliant taxpayers.

So far so good. New tax measures and heightened tax rates alone brought in something like Rs805 billion, but nowhere can one find a breakdown of this figure to learn which revenue heads contributed the bulk of this increase. But take a quick look at the July to March figures released by the finance ministry on its website. In the July to March period, the data there shows an increase of Rs1.7tr in FBR tax collection, of which Rs863bn comes from ‘direct taxes’. Based on reporting from earlier this year, you can be certain that an appreciable portion of this increase comes from taxes paid by salaried individuals.
And therein lies the rub. The chairman is keen to tell us that he has performed a great feat and raked in incremental revenues under very difficult conditions. But he is not willing to give us a breakdown of where this money has come from. If he were to do so, the data would most likely show that the FBR has pulled off this great feat by squeezing more from a few, rather than increasing the base of taxation. They have succeeded in pulling blood from stone. If this is not the case, they should release a breakdown, which shows the largest revenue heads that have contributed to the Rs805bn increase in collection from ‘new taxes and rates’.
Their one initiative to try and broaden the base was the so-called Tajir Dost Scheme, and although the finance minister went on record as late as February saying that he stood by the scheme, despite its rather dismal performance till then, they had to admit defeat and abandon it barely a month later. Revenue collection under that scheme was then replaced with withholding taxes on unregistered retailers, which they say led to a large increase in retailers registering themselves, and in some cases even a net positive tax liability.
This is the crux of the problem that needs to be highlighted over and over again. Salaried people have seen their purchasing power burn in the inflationary fire that raged ferociously from 2021 to 2024. As soon as that fire was doused they saw a raft of taxes. First, they had to pay for the state’s excesses in pushing growth via reckless money supply creation. Then they had to pay for bridging the state’s fiscal deficit. At least some of the money they have been forced to contribute has gone to increase compensation for government servants (including military officers) and ministers. The state shields itself and its personnel from the effects of its own excesses and incompetence. And compliant salaried people, who belong to all sections of the middle class, have to foot the bill.
What makes this possible is the near total absence of any voice that salaried people have in the country’s policy conversation. When the Finance Bill 2025 came up for discussion in the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, objections were raised on the tax on solar panels, the powers of arrest for FBR officers and the provisions that would make it more difficult for non-filers to buy and sell high-value assets.
But there was barely a whisper about salaried people or taxes on business income, which hits small and medium enterprises harder than large manufacturers. Even the so-called people’s representatives were more worried about the rights of non-filers and tax fraudsters than the massive burden placed on compliant, honest payers.
Now begins round two of this charade. For the fiscal year which began this week, they have to pull this feat off one more time. FBR revenues have to rise by Rs2.4tr all over again, but already, the stone has nearly been bled to death. Some amount of this will come from ‘autonomous growth’ though that amount will be smaller due to lower inflation. And the rest, dear reader, will land on your doorstep, regardless of how you feel, and irrespective of what magic trick they are claiming they intend to pull off next year. Happy new fiscal year to all my readers.

• Officials targeted en route from Nawagai to Khar after conducting anti-encroachment drive
BAJAUR: An assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area on Wednesday afternoon.
District Police Officer Waqas Rafique said it was an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion and said the bomb was planted on a motorcycle parked alongside the road.
Four people, including Nawagi subdivision assistant commissioner (AC) Faisal Ismail, Nawagi tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, policeman Zahid Khan and a passerby, Fazal Manan, died at the scene, while 18 others were injured when the IED went off, District Police PRO Israr Khan told Dawn.
One of the wounded policemen, identified as ASI Noor Hake­em, passed away while being shifted to hospital in Peshawar.
Sources told Dawn that AC Ismail and his team were returning to the Civil Colony Khar after conducting an anti-encroachment drive in Nawagai bazaar, when their official vehicle was targeted.
Residents, police and rescue officials told Dawn that the incident occurred on the Bajaur-Pesh­awar highway in Sadiqabad market, about 5km from district headquarters Khar, around 1:45pm.
Rescue 1122 workers alongside locals from nearby areas rushed to the scene and began efforts to transport the injured to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar where emergency was already declared.
The DPO along with a team of senior police officials visited the spot and collected evidence to be used for investigation.
News of the blast spread quickly across the district, especially in Khar tehsil, prompting scores of people from all walks of life to rush to the Khar DHQ Hospital to donate blood for the injured.
According to the updated data shared by Rescue 1122 and the medical superintendent of the Khar DHQ hospital, four policemen identified as constable Ayaz Khan, constable Muhammad Zameen, constable Saidur Rehman and Fazal Haq were among 17 people wounded in the blast.
 
 

The reports stated that five injured individuals, including three policemen, were referred to various hospitals in Peshawar due to their critical condition, while the others remained under treatment at the DHQ hospital.
The bodies of all five victims were dispatched to their native areas after their combined official funeral prayers held at the police line late on Wednesday evening.
The body of assistant commissioner Faisal Ismail was sent to his native Wadigram area of Swat district.
Both the outlawed TTP and the IS-Khorasan militant group claimed responsibility for the attack on social media.
The incident also drew condemnation from President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz Sharif, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur, and Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, among several others.

This development has firmly established the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) as the dominant force in the provincial legislature.
As a direct consequence of the ECP’s ruling, the total number of PML-N members in the Punjab Assembly has surged from 206 to 229. This increase is primarily attributed to a substantial rise in their representation on reserved seats for women, which climbed from 36 to 57. Similarly, the party’s presence on minority seats has also seen an uptick, increasing from five to seven.
 
 

Other political parties have also seen changes in their numerical strength. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has gained one minority and one women’s reserved seat, boosting its total membership from 14 to 16.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) now holds three women’s reserved seats, up from two, bringing their total members to 11. The Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) also saw an increase in its representation, gaining one women’s reserved seat, which raised its total members from six to seven.
Despite these changes, the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) strength in the Punjab Assembly remains at 76 members, while the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) continues to have 27 members. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) each retain their single seats.
Overall, in the 371-member Punjab Assembly, 369 are currently present. One independent member, Mian Aslam Iqbal elected from PP-171 (Lahore-27) in the 2024 vote, is yet to take the oath, and a by-election for one seat is still pending.
The Election Commission’s recent decision has effectively reshaped the political dynamics within the Punjab Assembly, solidifying the PML-N’s numerical majority in the house.

Can it be climate-proofed? What will be the direction of the journey and how can we proceed?
Parliamentary oversight in nascent democracies like ours is fundamental to effective democratic governance. It provides mechanisms for legislative scrutiny of government actions, policies and budgets. A comparative analysis of parliamentary oversight systems in Pakistan and other democracies shows stark differences in institutional effectiveness, particularly concerning environmental and climate governance oversight.
Pakistan’s parliamentary committees have a crucial role in shaping the climate future of the nation — one of the most vulnerable to, and least prepared for, climate change. Yet, gaps in parliamentary scrutiny persist even if Pakistan has adopted Climate Budget Tagging, classifying 35 per cent of non-tax revenue and 9.4pc of gross revenues as climate-relevant.
 
 

Despite being led by stalwarts, climate parliamentary committees face limitations. They lack timely access to the finance bill and are neither empowered nor sufficiently resourced, leading to cursory oversight that seldom challenges or proposes substantial increases in climate allocations. This oversight is highlighted in IMF reports. In several ways, the IMF’s policy actions under its $7 billion Extended Finance Facility and $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility fill the void left by weak parliamentary oversight.

Pakistan’s parliamentary committees have a crucial role in shaping our climate future.

Unaddressed priorities: The 2025-26 budget process, offered an opportunity to the National Assembly and Senate Standing Committees on Climate Change to define their oversight role. Despite an 183pc increase in mitigation funding, committees failed to adequately scrutinise the finance bill or challenge steps such as the 18pc tax on solar panels. Significant cuts, including 66pc in pollution abatement and 82pc in agricultural research, were also overlooked.
There is no public record of substantial committee review or objection to key budget decisions, nor did committees adequately assess alignment with Pakistan’s updated NDCs or national priorities such as water and food security, or disaster risk reduction. For FY2025-26, climate initiatives make up about 7pc of the total budget and 8pc of the development budget. This is concerning, given our need for accelerated climate adaptation investment.
One is not certain if the committees had an opportunity to further advance Pakistan’s climate agenda, including proposing enhanced allocations for ecosystem-based adaptation aligned with the National Adaptation Plan’s emphasis on otherwise celebrated nature-based solutions. Ironically, a new carbon levy was introduced to discourage fossil fuel use, but without tabling specific plans to fund or outlining their expected impact on communities. This approach of funding climate transition through fossil fuel consumption contradicts our long-term decarbonisation goals. Deeper scrutiny was also needed for climate finance revenue streams, supported by stronger committee proposals for diversifying green revenue mechanisms.
The budget allocated only Rs2.78bn for climate change under the PSDP, while $348bn is needed by 2030. Committees could have proposed higher allocations and innovative financing. But even more critically, the committees have not begun to scrutinise how PSDP allocation will be climate-proofed during the fiscal year.
Insufficient integration: The parliamentary committees have not fully grasped how budget allocations connect with Pakistan’s overall climate policy frameworks. They missed important opportunities to engage with new financial tools like Climate Budget Tagging, Pakistan Green Taxonomy and the National Climate Finance Strategy. It was also an opportunity for parliamentary committees to provide oversight to ensure that public sector investments are effectively climate-proofed, particularly by monitoring the implementation of the Handbook on Climate Risk Screening for Policy Planning, designed to integrate climate resilience into all development projects, and approved by the cabinet. Limited involvement prevents climate considerations from being properly integrated across government spending.
Experts and international partners have urged parliament to propose better funding allocations and explore new financing options like leveraging private sector investments, municipal bonds, disaster risk financing, and climate trust funds. Stronger parliamentary oversight is essential for accountability and improved climate finance management. The Pakistan Institute of Parliamentary Services is mandated to serve as a research secretariat for parliamentary committees.
These committees must show greater leadership in advancing adaptation finance strategies and robust mitigation policies. They should formally advocate for increased funding across sectors like early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, and water security. Opportunities exist to champion investments in renewable energy.
Empowering parliament: Pakistan’s latest budget process reveals an urgent need for enhanced parliamentary climate oversight and opportunities for institutional development through international cooperation. Limited committee engagement creates governance gaps, undermining climate action and democratic accountability. Empowered oversight is a democratic imperative and climate necessity. With support, climate committees can become effective agents of change.
Formal partnerships and knowledge sharing with leading global parliaments will enable Pakistan’s committees to adopt best practices in budget review, build institutional capacity, and enhance climate governance. Skeleton structures exist, but committees need to model their engagement with climate oversight on the UK’s parliamentary approach led by their Environmental Audit Committee that scrutinises government policies on climate change, emissions reduction and sustainability, ensuring accountability.
The Climate Change Committee advises parliament on carbon budgets, monitors progress on net-zero emissions and assesses climate risks and adaptation efforts. Additionally, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Climate Change is a cross-party group of members of both Houses that promotes discussion and action on climate policy. These bodies offer a model for Pakistan to strengthen its climate governance and parliamentary scrutiny.
Moving forward: To strengthen climate oversight, committees should first undertake procedural reforms: mandatory pre-budget hearings, stakeholder engagement and ongoing capacity building through global partnerships. Giving committees the authority to extend deliberation periods and empowering them to propose budget amendments would align our system with global best practices. Meanwhile, the climate committees can create dedicated research services and enhance coordination between them and the planning and development, and finance and revenue committees.

According to news reports, several senior PTI leaders, who have now been in jail for close to two years, have written to their incarcerated chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on one only with the military establishment.
Their letter, sent from Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore, proposes that the PTI resolve matters with the political leadership first and then approach the powers that be. Though there are some questions regarding the letter, such as who wrote it and whether it was really signed by the jailed leaders, who are being held in separate barracks, its contents do not seem unreasonable or outside the realm of political possibility.
The signatories reportedly include PTI vice-chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, all of whom have made a significant personal sacrifice for the party.
The PTI cadres may have good cause to resent the current regime, but the party should remember that its experience is not unique. Every national political entity has faced similar humiliation, oppression and/or forced capitulation at some stage of its career. During the height of the last overt dictatorship, some parties realised they could not continue to allow themselves to be used against each other for the establishment’s long vendetta against civilian rule.
The Charter of Democracy was born of that realisation. But when the PTI emerged as a major political force, rather than embracing the Charter’s spirit, it aligned itself with those historically opposed to civilian supremacy. Since its ouster, there has merely been a turning of the tables. Therefore, for its own sake and for the sake of Pakistan’s besieged democracy, it needs to first re-establish the rules of engagement with other political parties.
The jailed PTI leaders’ perspective should matter, especially to those who are out among the people and struggling to keep the party together due to their inability to establish clear lines of communication with the top leadership.
But, as always, much depends on what party chief Imran Khan thinks of the proposal. The jailed leaders have requested to be included in the dialogue process and to have regular access to the former prime minister at Adiala Jail. Given the interest this letter has generated, it appears that the space for dialogue may not have closed yet.
The initiative, tentative as it may be, deserves encouragement, including from the government. If space for reconciliation remains, both the government and PTI must seize it before the country’s democratic prospects are buried even deeper under the weight of their endless confrontation.

• Minister says govt committed to protecting human rights; insists commission must follow SOPs
LAHORE: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has expressed deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.
 






It added that HRCP’s work is based on the rights of all citizens and persons, as enshrined in the Constitution and Pakistan’s international commitments and obligations.
“We note with disappointment that persons claiming to represent the security apparatus have obstructed the organisation of HRCP events by informing either the venue or our staff that a no-objection certificate (NOC) was required for indoor meetings, although this is not a legal requirement.
“Two recent examples include a high-level consultation in Islamabad on regions facing militancy and terrorism and their impact on human rights, and a roundtable in Gilgit on local communities’ right to natural resources. Ironically, both the relevant legislators and officials from government departments had confirmed their participation on both occasions,” it added.
The statement said: “There have also been incidents across the country where our members and staff faced harassment and intimidation. For the first time in HRCP’s decades-long history, its chairperson was taken in for questioning by the police in Karachi. We have reason to believe that other actions are not merely coincidental.
 
 

“These include an attempt to seal our office premises in Lahore in 2024, the removal of the office’s electricity meter, and a bank’s refusal to release our funds, citing a State Bank of Pakistan directive — the existence of which was categorically denied by the latter in writing when asked by a court.”
The HRCP urged the authorities to respect the fundamental freedoms of association, assembly, and expression, and to ensure that human rights defenders can operate without fear of reprisal or undue interference.
“Civil society organisations such as HRCP are essential if Pakistan wishes to develop into a state that upholds the rights of all its citizens and remains responsible for their well-being. More broadly, human rights work helps create a more tolerant and inclusive society — something that Pakistan is in dire need of at present,” the statement concluded.
HRCP Chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt told Dawn that some months ago, a police contingent, including lady police officers, arrived at his residence and took him to the local police station. He said he was threatened and asked irrelevant questions about his family. A large number of lawyers and journalists gathered outside the police station, and he was released after being held for a few hours.
HRCP Secretary General Harris Khalique said the organisation’s credibility comes from its independence, responsible behaviour, courage, and impartiality. “Muzzling our voice will be as big a loss for the country as ours,” he added.
Founding member Hina Jillani told Dawn that the state’s actions against the commission were short-sighted and could not silence the voice of civil society. “We constructively gave recommendations to the state about rule of law, democracy, and the situation of human rights in the country, and it was their right to do so.”
She said the state had made some matters sensitive on its own due to its short-sightedness and urged the authorities to widen their perspective and listen attentively to the voices raised in HRCP’s consultative meetings.
Former chairperson and current council member Zohra Yusuf pointed to the broader issue of democratic backsliding in the country and the disregard for the rule of law by the very institutions meant to uphold it. She expressed dismay over the lodging of various FIRs as well as threats and intimidation faced by HRCP members and office bearers.
SOPs for holding events
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry told Dawn that the government is pursuing legislation in support of human rights and would ensure the rights of all citizens.
He said that HRCP must also adhere to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set for holding any event. “Everyone has to intimate the administration and seek an NOC for holding any religious event, human rights consultation, or any other gathering to ensure security,” he said.
Mr Chaudhry maintained that obtaining an NOC from the administration is a legal requirement for holding events and HRCP should comply with it. “National and foreign delegates were invited to HRCP events, and the state needs to be informed to provide better security,” he added.
He further stated that the government is committed to upholding the human rights of all citizens and, if other departments are approaching the HRCP, the organisation must fulfil all legal requirements.

US District Judge Randolph Moss said in a 128-page opinion that Trump’s Jan 20 proclamation blocking all migrants  “engaged in the invasion across the southern border” from claiming asylum or other humanitarian protections went beyond his executive power.
The American Civil Liberties Union brought the challenge to Trump’s asylum ban in February on behalf of three advocacy groups and migrants denied access to asylum, arguing the broad ban violated US laws and international treaties. Moss said he would stay the effective date of a related order for 14 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.
 
 

The decision applies to migrants who were subject to Trump’s ban or could be in the future, part of a certified class in the litigation. Such class certifications remain unaffected by last week’s Supreme Court decision reining in nationwide injunctions.
Moss ruled that neither federal immigration law nor the US Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented  “enormous challenges.”
“Nothing in the [Immig­ration and Nationality Act] or the Constitution grants the President or his delegees the sweeping authority asserted in the Proclamation and implementing guidance,” wrote Moss, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.  “An appeal to necessity cannot fill that void.”

Meanwhile, the National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority has also issued multiple impact-based weather alerts for various regions of Pakistan in light of forecasted severe weather conditions expected from July 2 till July 8.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, with water levels in major rivers and hill torrents expected to rise sharply, flash floods are likely in Dera Ghazi Khan and urban flooding is anticipated in major cities of the province, including Lahore.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia issued the alert and directed all deputy commissioners (DCs) and disaster response teams to remain alert.

NEOC issues alert for severe weather conditions till July 8 as monsoon system pairs with westerly wave

The Provincial Control Room is operating round-the-clock, and emergency services like Rescue 1122 have been put on high alert, he added.
Farmers have been advised to manage their activities accordingly, while tourists and travelers have been urged to avoid risky routes, especially in landslide-prone areas such as Murree and Galliyat.
 
 

The disaster authority has warned people against staying in weak structures, venturing near floodwaters, or ignoring weather advisories.
Lightning strikes and roof collapse pose additional risks, it warns, saying children are particularly vulnerable near accumulated rainwater or floodwater.
It also issued a weather alert warning of intensified monsoon rains across the province from July 5, forecasting heavy-to-very heavy rainfall in most districts until July 10.
The advisory highlights risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides, particularly in vulnerable areas like Murree, Galliyat, and DG Khan mountains.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents, coupled with a westerly wave, will trigger widespread rains, windstorms and thunderstorms, with the heaviest downpours expected in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Sargodha.
It warns that the low-lying areas in major cities, including Lahore and Rawalpindi, may face urban flooding, while hill torrents in DG Khan and northeastern Punjab could overflow.
Severe weather conditions
Meanwhile, the NEOC said in a statement that these alerts highlight the growing risk of flash floods, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and urban flooding in different parts of the country.
 
 

Low to moderate rainfall was likely to continue until July 5, after which an active southwest monsoon system, coupled with a westerly wave, was expected to enter the country triggering moderate to heavy rainfall and localised thunderstorms.
The most affected regions include upper catchments of major rivers including central and lower Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Due to this forecast, increased river flows were expected across the country.
In particular, Kabul River Nowshera is likely to swell due to rising tributaries such as Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah.
Inflows into Tarbela Dam may reach the low flood limit. Flash floods in riverine areas, especially where nullahs and local streams converge, may pose threats to nearby settlements.
Simultaneously, the risk of glacial lake outburst floods and landslides had increased in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where ongoing high temperatures had accelerated glacier and snow melt.
The situation was further worsened by incoming moist currents and rainfall. Vulnerable glacial valleys and narrow mountain passes may face sudden glacial lake outburst floods, flash floods, road blockages, and disruptions to infrastructure and tourism.
The National Disaster Management Authority has has urged the public to take precautionary measures.
It asked residents in at-risk areas to avoid unnecessary travel, secure important belongings, and prepare for potential evacuation.

• Firing, strikes by Israeli forces claim lives of 139 Palestinians in 24 hours
CAIRO: After US President Donald Trump announced that Israel had agreed to the “necessary conditions” to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas said on Wednesday it was studying the so-called “final ceasefire proposal”.
But while the group wants Israel to completely pull out of the enclave, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has set his sights on the elimination of Hamas.
A day earlier, Trump had said that after a “long and productive” meeting between his representatives and Israeli officials, Tel Aviv had agreed to the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.
 
 

In its statement, Hamas said it was studying new ceasefire offers it received from the mediators Egypt and Qatar, but stressed it aimed to reach an agreement that would ensure an end to the war and an Israeli pullout from Gaza.
In a statement, Hamas said it was “conducting national consultations to discuss what we received from the proposals of the… mediators.”
It added that it sought “to reach an agreement that guarantees ending the aggression, achieving the withdrawal (of Israel from Gaza) and urgently aiding our people in the Gaza Strip”.
Qatar and Egypt have been mediating efforts to end the conflict.
A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations said, “There are no fundamental changes in the new proposal” under discussion compared to previous terms presented by the United States.
The source said the new proposal “includes a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release half of the (22) living” Israeli prisoners in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for Israel releasing a number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
“There will not be a Hamas. There will not be a Hamastan. We’re not going back to that. It’s over,” Netanyahu claimed at a meeting hosted by the Trans-Israel pipeline.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said a majority within the coalition government would back an agreement that would see the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in Gaza.
Of the 50 Israeli prisoners yet to be released, at least 20 are believed to be still alive.
Deaths in Gaza
Meanwhile, Gaza health authorities said Israeli gunfire and military strikes killed at least 139 Palestinians in separate attacks in north and southern areas over the past 24 hours.
 
 

Among those killed on Wednesday was Marwan Al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, who perished in an airstrike that also claimed the lives of his wife and five children, medics say.
For Palestinians, who have fled multiple times and face daily struggles to find food 21 months into Israel’s military campaign, there was a glimmer of hope but many worried that any ceasefire would only be temporary.
“We want a complete end to the war on Gaza, not like every time — a partial agreement and ceasefire that lasts a month or two, then the war returns,” said Samir Al-Masri in Khan Yunis.
At the end of May, Hamas had said it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, which Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff said was “totally unacceptable”.
That proposal had involved a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the remains of other Palestinians; Hamas would release the remaining Israeli prisoners as part of a deal that guarantees the end of the war.
A source close to Hamas said that Hamas leaders were expected to debate the proposal and seek clarifications from mediators before giving an official response.
Meanwhile, the Hamas-run interior ministry has accused Yasser Abu Shabab, a Bedouin clan leader, of treason and ordered him to surrender and face trial.
Shabab, who does not recognise the authority of Hamas and accuses the group of hurting the interests of Gaza, had 10 days to surrender, the ministry said.
The Abu Shabab group described the Hamas order as a “sitcom that doesn’t frighten us, nor does it frighten any free man who loves his homeland and its dignity”, in a post on the Facebook page that usually carried the group’s announcements.
Israel also claimed to back some of Gaza’s clans against Hamas, but has not said which.

• Ruling coalition’s strength in NA jumps to 235, opposition shrinks to 98
• Four independents also added to govt tally
ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition formally gained a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributed the disputed reserved seats among the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F, in light of last week’s Supreme Court verdict.
The ECP issued victory notifications for 74 of 77 lawmakers, including 19 members of the National Assembly, 27 of the Punjab Assembly, 25 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly.
 
 

These reserved seats for women and non-Muslims were originally designated for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the electoral front of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
The ECP’s decision follows a landmark 7-3 majority decision by a 10-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which last week overturned a previous 8-5 verdict delivered by a 13-member bench on July 12, 2024. The earlier judgement had ruled in favour of PTI’s eligibility for reserved seats.
The PML-N secured the most, bagging 43 out of the 74 seats across the national and provincial legislatures.
The PPP has benefited by the addition of 14 seats, while the JUI-F saw its tally rise by 13. One seat each has gone to the PML-Q, MQM-Pakistan, Awami National Party, PTI-Parliamentarians and the Iste­h­kam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP).
Among the 19 restored National Assembly seats, 13 were awarded to PML-N, four to PPP, and two to JUI-F.
Three National Assembly notifications were withheld — JUI-F’s Sadaf Khan, due to a Supreme Court order dated April 22, 2024; and PML-N’s Sobia Shahid and Shehla Bano, who have already taken oath as members of the KP Assembly.
Although the Supreme Court bench did not clarify how the reserved seats would be redistributed, the ECP had already allocated them among various parties following the Peshawar High Court’s decision.
However, a week after the apex court suspended the PHC verdict last year, the ECP had halted notifications for 77 lawmakers elected on these reserved seats across the National and provincial assemblies.
Updated party position
The National Assembly has now updated the party position. According to an official document issued by the NA Secretariat, the PML-N now leads with 123 members, the PPP has increased its strength to 74, the MQM-P holds 22 seats, PML-Q five, and IPP four. The Balochistan Awami Party, National Party, and PML-Z each retain one seat.
The total now stands at 231, but the document cites the ruling coalition’s strength as 235, also counting four independent lawmakers.
Sources told Dawn these include Chaudhry Usman Ali (NA-142 Sahiwal), Mubarak Zeb (NA-8 Bajaur), Aurangzeb Kitchi (NA-159 Vehari) and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146 Khanewal) — all of whom were PTI-backed independents who have since switched allegiances.
According to the document, the opposition’s strength in the 333-member house has shrunk to 98, comprising 80 SIC members, 10 from JUI-F, five PTI-backed independents, and one each from Balochistan National Party, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party.
In the Punjab Assembly, PML-N’s tally has risen to 229 from 206 with the addition of 23 seats (21 for women and two for non-Muslims). PPP now holds 16 seats compared to 14 previously, as it gained one seat each reserved for women and minorities. PML-Q and IPP have 11 and seven seats, respectively, after gaining one reserved seat each for women.
In the Sindh Assembly, PPP’s numbers rose to 120, with one additional seat each for women and non-Muslims. Its rival MQM-P now holds 38 seats after securing one more reserved seat for women.
In KP, JUI-F saw the biggest gain, adding 10 seats (eight for women, two for non-Muslims) to reach a total of 29.
PML-N added seven (six for women, one for minorities), reaching 26. PPP’s representation doubled to 12 with the addition of five reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. PTI-Parliamentarians and ANP each added one seat, bringing their totals to five each.

• Tasks Kundi with engaging opposition MPAs to explore options for forming a new govt
• Aimal Wali warns against dissolving KP govt, advises PM to ‘let it collapse on its own’
ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‘regime change’ in Khyber Pakht­un­khwa (KP), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation.
The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events had further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan called on the PM, where they discussed the prevailing political scenario.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ameer Maqam,  Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashar Iqbal, Prime Minister’s  Adviser Rana Sanaullah, Minister of State for Power Abdul Rehman Kanju  and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Talha Barki were also  present on the occasion.
A source close to Governor Kundi told Dawn that the issue of possible change of KP government was thoroughly discussed.
 
 

“Yes, we discussed the matter,” the source quoted Mr Kundi as saying. A press release issued by the governor’s spokesperson said the PM  tasked Mr Kundi to start a campaign for forming a new government in KP and hold consultation with opposition members of the provincial assembly.
Mr Kundi and federal minister Ameer Muqam have also been tasked to meet JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultation.
But others offered different counsel. When contacted, ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan told Dawn that the issue was discussed during his meeting with the PM. However, he said he had advised the premier against dissolving the KP government through  ‘external means’.
“I told the PM that let the KP government die its own death. If you (PM) remove the provincial government, you will give an easy escape to the PTI-led regime, which has completely failed to deliver,” Mr Aimal said.
He said KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has no other way but to leave the government and if the Centre made any attempt to topple the PTI-led regime in KP, it would be a welcome move for the CM. “I told PM that Ali Amin Gandapur has taken maximum benefits after becoming CM and it will be a blessing for him if he is removed and sent home,” he added.
 
 

He further said the prime minister was ultimately convinced that forcefully removing the provincial government would be a mistake. “We are already suffering due to the trend of toppling governments and now how can we do it by ourselves,” he said.
Saudi peace efforts
PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appreciated the efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for peace in the Middle East as well as its significant role in the ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India.
The prime minister said this in a meeting with the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Islamabad Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, while fondly recalling his warm and cordial telephone conversation with the Saudi Crown Prince on June 24.
The PM told the ambassador that as Pakistan had assumed the rotating Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July, and it would count on Saudi Arabia’s support to ensure that its tenure was conducted smoothly and successfully.
PM to visit Baku
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office announced the PM would attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting on July 3.
In a statement, it said the PM will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.

Now, women will be able to get promotions and higher posts after changing their domiciles, as the Supreme Court has ruled that new domiciles will be considered and such changes will not affect the provincial quota. 
The judgement, a copy of which available with Dawn, was issued by a two-judge SC bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. 
The petition was filed by Dr Shumaila Naeem, a gold medallist, who joined government service as a medical officer based on her Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domicile. After marrying a civil servant with a Balochistan domicile, she changed her domicile to that of her husband. 

SC allows domicile change without career risk for couples in govt service

Subsequently, based on her new Balochistan domicile, she applied for the advertised post of Associate Professor (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), BPS-19, at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. She topped the written exam conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), but was not called for an interview due to her domicile change, with the FPSC alleging that her original domicile was from KP. 
Speaking to Dawn, Shumaila Naeem said her departmental representation and subsequent review petition were dismissed by the FPSC. “However, my appeal under Section 7(3)(d) of the FPSC Ordinance 1977 was allowed by the Islamabad High Court through a judgement dated January 28, 2025 by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq. But instead of implementing the IHC order, the FPSC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court,” she said. 
“The apex court held that a married woman retains the legal discretion or choice to either adopt her husband’s domicile or retain her own,” she added. 
The court ruled that the respondent had voluntarily opted to adopt her husband’s domicile, which is legally permissible. It rejected the FPSC’s stance and declared that the seat of Associate Professor is still vacant. The court directed that the candidate be considered for appointment to the post on the basis of her Balochistan domicile within a fortnight. 
Dr Shumaila said that in the past, many female civil servants had no choice but to work in a province different from their husbands’. 
“This decision, which has now become a precedent, will allow them to change their domiciles and serve at the same station as their husbands. It will bring peace of mind to them and their families,” she said.

Last month, Field Marshal Asim Munir became the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president when he met Donald Trump for talks at the White House. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law. The two had discussed joint counter-terrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington.
Today, PAF’s Directorate General of Public Relations (DGPR) said that in a “significant development” aimed at strengthening bilateral defence cooperation and advancing mutual interests, the air chief undertook an official visit to the US, adding that it was the “first by a serving PAF air chief in over a decade”.
It said the high-profile visit marked a “strategic milestone” in Pakistan-US defence cooperation and “proved instrumental in deepening institutional ties” in addition to addressing key regional and global security issues.
 






The DGPR said that at the Pentagon, the air chief called on US Air Force (International Affairs) Secretary Kelli L Seybolt and  Chief of Staff of the US Air Force General David W Allvin.
“The discussions centred around advancing bilateral military cooperation, enhancing interoperability and exploring avenues of joint training and technology exchange. Chief of the air staff highlighted the historic and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and US, particularly in the domains of defence and security cooperation.
“He reiterated his resolve to further enhance the existing ties in the realms of military-to-military cooperation and training between the air forces of the two countries. The two sides also agreed upon the continuation of high-level military engagements in future through senior-level interactions,” the DGPR said.
It said these interactions were deemed crucial for maintaining momentum in ongoing cooperative endeavours in the areas of joint training, operational exercises and military exchange programmes between the two nations.
At the US State Department, the air chief met Brown L Stanley from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Eric Meyer from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. The DGPR said the meetings served as a forum to “underscore Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional stability, its firm commitment to counter-terrorism efforts and its nuanced perspective on the evolving geopolitical dynamics of South and Central Asia”.
As part of his engagements at Capitol Hill, the air chief held “substantive dialogues with prominent members” of the US Congress, including Mike Turner, Rich McCormick and Bill Huizenga.
“These interactions reinforced the importance of robust engagement in strengthening bilateral relations and provided a valuable opportunity to share Pakistan’s views on strategic challenges, regional security frameworks and the impact of emerging technologies on defence cooperation.
“Emphasising Pakistan’s status as a peace-loving nation, the air chief reaffirmed the country’s enduring sacrifices and notable operational achievements in the global war on terror, while also outlining Pakistan’s evolving security calculus in response to the rapidly shifting regional geopolitical landscape.”
The DGPR said the “landmark visit” not only reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to promoting regional and global peace, but also laid the groundwork for renewed institutional collaboration, strategic dialogue and enhanced interoperability between it and the US Air Force.</p><small>2025-07-02 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0223155694a36f5.jpg?r=231611' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921678/sbps-foreign-exchange-reserves-climb-to-1451bn' target='_blank'><strong>SBP’s foreign exchange reserves climb to $14.51bn</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday that its foreign exchange reserves rose to $14.51 billion by June 30.

A press release issued by the SBP today said its reserves rose by $5.12bn to reach $14.51bn, as compared to $9.39bn on June 30 last year.
“This reflects a noticeable improvement in the country’s current account balance and realisation of planned inflows during the year,” the SBP said.
Earlier this week, China rolled over $3.4bn in loans, two senior Pakistani government officials told Reuters, in a move that was expected to help boost the country’s foreign exchange reserves, a requirement of the International Monetary Fund.
Beijing rolled over $2.1bn, which has been in the SBP’s reserves for the last three years, and refinanced another $1.3bn commercial loan, which Islamabad had paid back two months ago, the sources said.

Hailing today’s victory as a “milestone in women’s football”, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) wrote in an X post, “Pakistan defeats 95th-ranked Indonesia 2-0. Power, passion, and purpose on full display.”
 






Nadia Khan opened up the scoring eight minutes into the match, before Suha Hirani doubled the lead in the 19th minute by scoring a penalty.

“The onus was on Indonesia to find their way back, but despite introducing Isa, Helsya Maeisyaroh and Marsela Yuliana Awi into the mix, [Coach] Satoru Mochizuki’s charges were unable to overturn the deficit,” said an AFC press release.
 






Pakistan face Kyrgyzstan in the final game of the group on July 5 (Saturday).

Last week, the Constit­utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.
Acting on the court’s verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its July 24 and 29 notifications from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.
In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.
After this process, the ruling coalition ach­ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224.
 


The National Assembly Secretariat’s Legislation Branch later issued the National Assembly composition reflecting the actual party position after the apex court’s verdict and ECP’s distribution. It showed the treasury benches as now having 235 seats to the opposition’s 98 seats, for a total of 333 seats with one MNA suspended and two reserved seats being vacant.
The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies. In the KP Assembly, 10 seats were given to the JUI-F, seven to the PML-N, six to the PPP and one each to the PTI-Parliamentarians and Awami National Party.
The PML-N was given 23 seats in the Punjab Assembly, two for the PPP and one each to the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party.
In the Sindh Assembly, two seats were given to the PPP and one to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.
Reserved seats case
Through its March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls — of reserved seats.
In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.
The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.
The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP becoming major beneficiaries. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.
On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority verdict, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.
However, the ruling was not implemented by the National Assembly, while the ECP had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, ECP and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgment.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p><small>2025-07-02 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021903375b7da8f.jpg?r=191358' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921664/pti-presents-message-of-unity-warns-against-toppling-kp-govt' target='_blank'><strong>PTI presents ‘message of unity’, warns against toppling KP govt</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party was standing together and presenting a “message of unity” amid rumours of rifts while warning the federal government against toppling the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.
 
 

“We discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,” Gohar said. “It is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today’s meeting.”
Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran’s plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: “Whatever Khan sahib decides, we will execute it.”

Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today’s meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party’s direction to addressing dialogue with the government.
“Whatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.”
Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.
“This is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan sahib said that there should be dialogue,” Gohar said. “Even after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan sahib says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,” the party chairman added.
Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI’s part, but said that the government was “not sincere” since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.
Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. “Even if these seats go to the opposition … then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,” Gohar stated. “Those who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.”
PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with “discord set to one side”.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI’s government in KP.
“If you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state … if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,” he stated.

He criticised the government, saying that it was a “disgraceful stain on the state and its institutions” within the country’s political history, but “they are not ashamed”.
“We are time-tested people who have given sacrifices … So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan’s people.”
 


Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most “democratic day” in history, along with the “attack on Pakistani people”, referring to the election results.
“We will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.”
He further said, “We stand with Imran’s struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.”
Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench’s verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.
“Legal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,” Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran’s leadership and would remain so.</p><small>2025-07-02 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612082-no-lawful-way-to-oust-ptis-kp-govt-says-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>No lawful way to oust PTI's KP govt, says CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>
