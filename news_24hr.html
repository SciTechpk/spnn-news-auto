“The CPEC has brought new opportunities for livelihood, trade and connectivity to GB. Our collective task is to ensure that these opportunities reach every valley and every village, creating shared prosperity for all,” he said, while speaking at a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of the region’s freedom from Dogra rule.
“As we celebrate your independence day … let us renew our collective resolve to make GB a model of development, justice equality. Your region offers the best to the rest of the country and the world at large,” he said.
He also talked about the people of occupied Kashmir, saying: “While you enjoy liberty and rights under the flag of Pakistan, they continue to face occupation … we stand with them until they too can live in freedom in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.”
He further said that over the past seven decades, the people of GB had marched “shoulder to shoulder” with the rest of Pakistan.
“You have guarded our borders, advanced our progress, carried our flag to the world’s highest peaks. This region is not only the crown of Pakistan, but also our northern gateway and a symbol of our lasting friendship with China,” he said, adding that the Karakoram Highway stood as a “living memento” of the partnership with China.
In his remarks, the president said that the PPP had always extended a “loving hand and heart” toward the people of GB.
“Our priorities are pure. You should receive education, you should be healthy, and [in] every valley … there should be schools,” he said.
He highlighted the region’s strengths, including its capacity for hydroelectric power generation and the “limitless” potential for tourism.
“I was just talking to the commander sahib today, and I was thinking that the kinds of planes in which I came here — they are not very expensive. So if GB gets its own airline, then what’s the harm in that?” he asked, adding that his party’s efforts and intentions were to promote the region.
He concluded his remarks by saying: “May the people of GB continue to play their full part in building a progressive, prosperous Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-11-01 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/01141709a438092.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952550/jordan-germany-say-international-force-in-gaza-needs-un-mandate' target='_blank'><strong>Jordan, Germany say international force in Gaza needs UN mandate</strong></a><br><p>Jordan and Germany said on Saturday that an international force expected to support a future Palestinian police in Gaza under US President Donald Trump’s post-war governance plan should have a UN mandate.
Under the US-brokered ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, a coalition of mainly Arab and Muslim nations is expected to deploy forces in the Palestinian territory.
The so-called international stabilisation force is supposed to train and support vetted Palestinian police in the Strip, with backing from Egypt and Jordan, as well as secure border areas and prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas.
 
 

“We all agree that in order for that stabilisation force to be able to be effective in getting the job done, it has to have a Security Council mandate,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.
Jordan, however, will not be sending its own forces to the Strip.
“We’re too close to the issue and we cannot deploy troops in Gaza,” Safadi said, adding his country was nonetheless ready to cooperate with the international force.
Safadi was speaking at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain alongside his German counterpart Johann Wadephul, who also supported a UN mandate for the force, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”.
“We understand that this is of utmost importance to those countries who might be willing to send troops to Gaza and for the Palestinians. Germany would also want to see a clear mandate for this mission,” Wadephul said.
The idea of the stabilisation force has drawn some criticism, with UN experts last month warning it would “replace Israeli occupation with a US-led occupation, contrary to Palestinian self-determination”.
The UN has mandated international peacekeeping forces in the region for decades, including UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, which is currently working with the Lebanese army to enforce a November 2024 ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.</p><small>2025-11-01 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/011047165a7aca6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952541/return-of-afghans-via-torkham-border-resumes' target='_blank'><strong>Return of Afghans via Torkham border resumes</strong></a><br><p>Officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan said on Saturday that the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been reopened for Afghan refugees returning to their country.
Speaking to Dawn, Khyber Deputy Commissioner Bilal Rao confirmed that the Torkham border crossing had been reopened earlier today for the resumption of Afghan refugees’ repatriation.
Khizer Shah, the spokesman of the Pakistani embassy in Kabul, and Afghan officials also confirmed the development.
“Torkham gate is now open for refugees. We welcome our countrymen,” Qureshi Badloon, head of the Information and Culture in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, told Dawn.
The repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19.
Pakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border.
Trade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes.
Although Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the “border remains closed for trade for now” and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation.
Officials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return.
‘Thousands of refugees stranded’
Meanwhile, Afghan Consul General Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir told Dawn on Friday that thousands of Afghan refugees were stranded and living on the road due to the closure of the Torkham border crossing.
“There are hundreds of vehicles, carrying thousands of refugees, stranded on roads from Nowshera till Torkham,” he had said, adding that many did not have access to food, water or shelter.
He had stated that refugees were continuing to be expelled, especially from Punjab, which was leading to an increase in the number of those stranded on roads. He had appealed for the provision of water, tents and food for the stranded refugees.
 
 

Shakir said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had not helped the stranded refugees either, most of whom he said were registered and held Proof of Registration (PoR) cards.
Following the recent border tensions, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had asserted that the government would grant no further extension to Afghan refugees and that all refugee camps will be shut down.
He was informed that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals had been repatriated.
The government has also warned that harbouring illegal Afghan residents wo­­uld be treated as a serious offence and violators wo­­u­ld face stern punishment.</p><small>2025-11-01 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0113180815e75a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952544/not-planning-to-enter-politics-again-anytime-soon-says-ex-pti-leader-ali-zaidi' target='_blank'><strong>Not planning to enter politics again anytime soon, says ex-PTI leader Ali Zaidi</strong></a><br><p>Former PTI leader and ex-federal minister Ali Haider Zaidi on Saturday refuted reports of him “planning a political relaunch”, saying that he had no plans of doing so anytime soon.
Zaidi was among the top PTI leadership who quit either the party or politics altogether amid a state crackdown on the party following the May 9, 2023 riots, which witnessed military installations being vandalised in protest of Imran’s arrest earlier that day.
“Some [are] suggesting that I’m planning a political relaunch. Let me be clear: I am not planning to enter politics anytime soon,” Zaidi said on X.
 






The first reason Zaidi stated for not rejoining politics was that his “financial circumstances and my personal family obligations” would not allow it.
“Secondly, there is no politics in a country where the corrupt, the land grabbers, the extortionists, even those with blood on their hands are gifted power through a rigged election, protected by a compromised judiciary, which even today, fails to deliver justice,” he claimed.
“When justice dies, politics loses its purpose,” the former PTI Sindh president said.
“Imran Khan was, and remains, the only leader who truly tried to change this system. Sadly, he’s rotting in jail. And we all know why,” he added.
“I wish all my old colleagues well,” Zaidi further said.
The clarification comes after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release.
The media reports had claimed that ex-ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Asad Umar, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, former MNA Mahmood Moulvi, and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots.
According to the Tribune report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” the publication reported a source as saying.
 
 

The reports come after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met PTI vice president Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail.
“If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him (Qureshi), then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” they said.
They affirmed that the entire PTI wanted Imran to be freed from prison and alleged that some elements within the party wanted otherwise so “their leadership can keep shining”.

Trump announced he would be hiking tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 per cent and terminated all trade talks following what he called the “fake” anti-tariff ad campaign.
“I did apologise to the president. The president was offended,” Carney told journalists in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, adding trade talks would restart when the US is “ready”.
Carney also confirmed that he had reviewed the ad with Ford before it aired, but said he had opposed using it.
“I told Ford I did not want to go forward with the ad,” he said.
The ad, commissioned by Ford, an outspoken Conservative politician who is sometimes compared to Trump, uses a snippet of Republican icon and former president Reagan saying that tariffs cause trade wars and economic disaster.
Carney also called talks with China’s leader Xi Jinping a “turning point” in relations, adding he had raised tricky topics like foreign interference with Beijing.
 
 

Canada’s relations with China have been among the worst of any Western nation but both are at the sharp end of Trump’s tariff onslaught, even after Xi and the US leader’s deal on Thursday to dial back tensions.
China and Canada on Friday held their first formal talks between their leaders since 2017.
“We have now unlocked a path forward to address current issues,” Carney told journalists in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, referring to China.
“Our overall discussion was constructive,” he added.
Carney said on Saturday he had accepted an invitation from Xi to visit “in the new year”.
“I directed our ministers and officials to work together to find solutions to current challenges and to identify areas for cooperation and growth,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-01 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/011215129cd6c74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952539/no-democracy-without-womens-participation-eyebrows-raised-at-kps-all-male-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>‘No democracy without women’s participation’: Eyebrows raised at KP’s all-male cabinet</strong></a><br><p>After days of existing in a state of limbo, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s new cabinet finally took shape on Friday after ten provincial ministers were sworn in while two advisers and a special assistant were appointed.
However, many on social media were quick to point out that the new KP government, with Chief Minister Sohail Afridi at the helm, lacked female representation.
“No woman representation, afsos (regrettable),” said Haroon Rashid, managing editor at Independent Urdu.
 






“These all-male clubs are not only unacceptable but also unstoppable,” said journalist Mariana Baabar.
“So it’s an all-male 13-member provincial cabinet picked by KP CM Afridi that took the oath of office on Friday in Peshawar,” she said.
 






National Democratic Movement member and ex-MNA Bushra Gohar, replying to KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, pointed out that he had “signed the summary of an all-male provincial cabinet”.
“You could have at least raised an observation about it. Concerning that women are excluded from all key decisions forums in the province,” she added.
 






Journalist Zahid Gishkori said he hoped that CM Afridi would include at least one woman in his cabinet.
 






Writer and activist Afiya Shehrbano Zia said the appointment of an “all-male KP cabinet reveals the limits of women’s loyalty to a populist male leader — only symbolic rewards available for political tradwives”.
 






Aaj TV Peshawar Bureau Chief Farzana Ali responded to a post from producer Adeel Raja, who said that the PTI’s reserved seats for women were “snatched” from the party and the lone woman who won on a general seat was the current deputy speaker of the provincial assembly.
Responding to this, she said that women could still be appointed as advisers and special assistants. She further stated that capable women like Ayesha Bano, a former member of the provincial assembly, can be included.
 






Former KP ombudsperson Rukhshanda Naz noted, “Men are included as advisers, why not women? There is no democracy without women’s participation.”
 






Meanwhile, Shireen Mazari, ex-human rights minister and former PTI leader, also joined the discourse. Echoing Raja’s opinion, she said that the ruling party only had one directly elected woman member in KP, who was also the current deputy speaker.
“The Election Commission of Pakistan/Supreme Court denied PTI the reserved seats it should have been given and merrily distributed them as free gifts to all other parties in the KP assembly. Was that acceptable to you?” she asked while responding to Baabar’s post.

According to a notification issued on Friday, the excise and taxation department “is pleased to extend the timeline for replacement of existing number plates with new security-featured number plates to 31st December, 2025 instead of 31st October, 2025 (in respect of all types of vehicles).”
Earlier in August, the Sindh government had extended the deadline for citizens to obtain new number plates featuring the Ajrak design until Oct 31, following instructions from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.

Journalists are now barred if they do not have prior approval to access the area in the West Wing known as Upper Press — which is where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s office is located.
White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended the move, saying without providing evidence that reporters had been “ambushing” cabinet secretaries in the area and secretly recording video and audio.
 
 

“This memorandum directs the prohibition of press passholders from accessing … ‘Upper Press,’ which is situated adjacent to the Oval Office, without an appointment,” said a memo from the White House National Security Council (NSC).
The memo, addressed to Leavitt and Cheung, said the aim was “protecting sensitive material from unauthorized disclosure in Upper Press”.
The policy comes amid wider restrictions on journalists by the Trump administration, including new rules at the Pentagon that major outlets including AFP refused to sign earlier this month.
White House reporters have until now been able to freely visit the area, often wandering up to try to speak to Leavitt or senior press officers to seek information or confirm stories.
Media are still allowed to access the area known as “Lower Press,” next to the famed White House briefing room, where more junior press officers have their desks, the memo said.
‘Eavesdropping’
The memo said the new restrictions were triggered by “recent structural changes to the NSC” that meant White House press officers were dealing with more sensitive material.
Republican Trump has effectively absorbed the once powerful NSC into the White House, putting it under the control of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was reassigned in May following a scandal over the use of the Signal app to plan strikes on Yemen.
But Cheung later went further, saying on X that “some reporters have been caught secretly recording video and audio of our offices, along with pictures of sensitive info, without permission”.
 






“Cabinet Secretaries routinely come into our office for private meetings, only to be ambushed by reporters waiting outside our doors,” he added, also accusing reporters of “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings”.
Cheung, a Trump veteran who is known for his combative social media approach, did not provide evidence for the claims.
US media said Democratic president Bill Clinton’s administration also sought to limit access to the Upper Press area, before rescinding the decision.
Trump’s administration has made a major shake-up to access rules for journalists since his return to power in January.
Many mainstream outlets have seen their access to areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One reduced, while right-wing, Trump-friendly outlets have been given more prominence.
The White House also banned the Associated Press news agency from key areas where Trump speaks after it refused to recognise his order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.</p><small>2025-11-01 05:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0109265300c0758.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952465/israeli-military-official-resigns-after-leaked-abuse-video-stirs-furore' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli military official resigns after leaked abuse video stirs furore</strong></a><br><p>JERUSALEM: The Israeli military’s chief legal officer resigned on Friday over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that showed soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict.
Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year.
The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case.
A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel.
It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear.
 
 

On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said that there has been an ongoing criminal inquiry into the video leak and that Tomer-Yerushalmi was on forced leave.
Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the war.
‘Violence must be probed’
The footage came from Sde Teiman detention camp, where some Hamas fighters are held.
Rights groups have reported grave abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention since Oct 2023. Israel’s military is investigating dozens of cases, but says abuse is not systematic.
Tomer-Yerushalmi called Sde Teiman detainees  “terrorists of the worst kind”, in her resignation letter, but added that this did not take away from the obligation to investigate suspected abuse.
“To my regret, this basic understanding — that there are acts to which even the most vile of detainees must not be subjected — is no longer convincing to all,” she said.
Some politicians were swift to seize on Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation. Katz said that anyone who fabricates “blood libels against Israeli soldiers was unworthy of donning IDF uniform”.
 
 

Police Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the resignation and called for an inquiry into more legal authorities.
He also posted a video of himself standing over Palestinian prisoners who were lying bound on the floor in an Israeli jail, saying that they were Oct 7 attackers who should receive the death penalty.
Around 1,700 Gaza detainees were freed this month as part of the ceasefire in exchange for 20 Israeli prisoners.

We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in” — Desmond Tutu
THERE is much talk of a ‘mental health crisis’ in Pakistan currently. Campaigns for ‘raising awareness and reducing stigma’ have been launched, encouraging people to talk about and seek help for mental health issues. There is a call for increased funding, upscaling mental health services and integrating mental health into primary care. These are all important and mental health definitely needs to be prioritised. But it is also equally important to reflect on what is driving this mental health crisis in Pakistan and what can be done about it.
The mental health crisis is not merely a health issue. It is a reflection of how power, inequality, and governance intersect to shape the emotional lives of millions of Pakistanis. The crisis is not a natural disaster but manmade — the outcome of 78 years of brutalisation of the people through social and economic injustice, political instability and structural poverty.
Pakistan’s history is defined by political turbulence. For almost half of its existence, Pakistan has had direct military rule and an indirect one even when there is a façade of civilian government. The events of the last three years, the stolen mandate, state violence and oppression, emasculation of the judiciary and parliament have all but eroded what little public trust there was in state institutions. This has serious psychological consequences. Pakistanis live in a permanent state of uncertainty. Political chaos is fuelling collective anxiety, cynicism, and a loss of civic sense. Fear and distrust have become national emotions.
For millions of Pakistanis, psychological suffering is inseparable from economic hardship. Rising inflation, unemployment and collapsing purchasing power has turned everyday life into a test of survival. When families cannot afford school fees or electricity bills, when people feel they cannot make ends meet, when savings evaporate overnight, mental distress is the natural outcome. Poverty is not only material deprivation; it is psychological violence inflicted by an unequal system.
 
 

Over 60 per cent of Pakistan’s population is under 30 years of age. What should be a demographic dividend has become a demographic crisis. Young people face shrinking opportunities, high unemployment, and an outdated education system disconnected from labour markets. Merit is sacrificed for nepotism and favouritism; hard work is replaced by connections. A society that denies its youth opportunity also denies them hope. No wonder every other young person wants to leave the country.

For millions of Pakistanis, psychological suffering is inseparable from economic hardship.

This suffering is not a ‘test of God’; it is political. The failure to provide social justice, address poverty, provide basic necessities, to control corruption — by neglecting social development — represents a deliberate abdication of state responsibility. The emotional cost is borne silently in our homes and workplaces across the country. This is criminal.
Among the many silent tragedies, Pakistan is the tragedy of suicides. The World Health Organisation estimates that between 13,000-20,000 people die by suicide each year and 10-20 times more attempt suicide, mostly by young people, under the age of 30 years. Poverty and unemployment stand out as major causes. This in a country that was created in the name of Islam, whose central tenet is social justice. We need to ask ourselves why then is the prohibition on suicides not having its deterrent effect in a country with 97pc Muslims.
This silence is strategic. To confront the mental health crisis would be to confront its root causes — poverty, inequality, corruption, and misgovernance. Instead, individuals are told to be patient, to pray, or to endure. Endurance, in this context, is not resilience; it is resignation. There is no greater insult than to label the silent suffering of Pakistanis as ‘resilience’. People have no choice but to struggle on.
Addressing the mental health crisis in Pakistan requires far more than setting up clinical services, increasing the number of psychiatrists and psychologists, setting up crisis helplines or offering interventions through apps or digital platforms. It demands a reordering of political and economic priorities. This means addressing the root causes of the mental distress of the population. We need truly representative governments, not one that is imposed on us. We need to curb corruption, which has eaten into the moral fabric of our society. We need to declare a national emergency in education in the country. Why are 25m children out of school in Pakistan? What is the future for them? We can spend billions of dollars over four days in a ‘war’ with one of our neighbours but cannot provide universal health coverage to our people.
Nearly one in three Pakistanis are estimated to be in need of mental healthcare. Yet, there is no separate budget for mental health and mental health spending is estimated to be less than 0.5pc of the national health budget. Whatever little is there, is eaten up by corruption and mismanagement. Access to psychiatric care remains confined to a few major cities, where it is largely unaffordable for the vast majority.
Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change has added a devastating dimension to the mental distress of its population. The 2022 floods displaced over 30m people, destroying homes, livelihoods, and communities. It was replayed in the recent floods in Punjab and KP. Many survivors continue to experience post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression — yet mental health remains absent from national disaster response and recovery plans. A nation’s true strength is measured not by the size of its economy or its armed forces, but by peace of mind of its citizens. Until Pakistan learns to prioritise the mental well-being of its people as a central pillar of its policies, our crisis of the mind will remain, silently but unmistakably, of our own making.

Under such regimes, the noose tightens around dissent, crackdowns on diversity become routine, and tolerance for alternative opinions vanishes.
In relation to this, we can perhaps be somewhat grateful that such blatant usurpations of power are no longer in fashion. However, that does not mean that such autocratic tendencies have disappeared. Where once political governments were sent packing on charges of plane hijackings, ironically, today, the victims of those alleged hijackings are accused of ‘hijacking’ the judiciary itself.
Through the 26th Amendment, the executive and legislature had been given de facto control over judicial appointments, bench selections, and judicial performance evaluations. Efforts to convene a full court to determine the amendment’s validity had been neutralised, at least till now, the seniority of Islamabad High Court judges had been tampered with, some judges were parachuted in to keep others out, courts were packed with judges perceived to favour the amendment, and whether or not such a perception is accurate, an impression had been created that the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had become a treasury bench, while the one in Sindh had become the ‘people’s bench’.
In these troubling times, some dissent persisted, primarily on the part of a handful of judges in the Supreme Court and the high courts. These judges were never an existential threat to the new system crafted by the establishment, nor are their present protests or expressions of concern a real danger to its continuation. Their dissent and expressions of grievance were, and perhaps remain, an inconvenience.
 
 

Even that, however, is now intolerable. With the notification of the revised Code of Conduct, it is apparent that dissent of any kind is unacceptable, and that conformity is not a choice but a compulsion. Nothing makes this more evident than the decision to borrow from resolutions passed in the dark days of the Musharraf era, a time when democracy was a fairy-tale and autocracy was fair game.

Designed to uphold judicial independence, the Code of Conduct could result in suppressing it.

Article V of the Code deals with public controversies and how to avoid them. The earlier version was broad and generic; the new one is sweeping in scope, with a tendency to expand into every form of expression. Notably, it now prohibits public controversies arising from any “speech, writing, debate or comment at any forum” — essentially covering all forms of free speech. Yet “public controversies” remain undefined, leaving the article ripe for misuse.
The same article further states that a judge shall “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly, nor shall he make public any communication relating to his personal or official matters”. On the face of it, it may seem fine. However, there is a deeper concern involved in the phrasing of this section. How is a judge to ensure that any of his remarks, observations, or findings — whether during the course of proceedings in court or in a written judgement — do not “cause” public discussion or controversy? Public reaction lies well beyond a judge’s control, and is that not what is expected of a judge? Moreover, a judge may, at times, need to justify or reason a decision by citing communications relating to personal or official matters. Once cited, these inevitably enter the public record — leaving the judge technically liable for misconduct under this vaguely worded provision.
 
 

Another notable revision concerns judges’ attendance at social events, gatherings, and functions, which the Code now directs them to abstain from altogether. Even soliciting an invitation to an international conference, amongst other things, regardless of whether it pertains to legal issues, could constitute misconduct. This restriction is alarming, as international conferences and similar forums allow judges to engage with diverse perspectives, broaden their understanding, and stay informed on current global developments.
Additionally, if a judge is personally criticised or his character attacked, he or she is stopped from responding in any form. Instead, an institutional response is prioritised. Similar processes apply to attempts to influence judges. Yet if history is any guide, institutional responses — particularly in times of turmoil — tend to be timid, if not entirely absent.
Clauses such as these might be uncontroversial in mature democracies where the judiciary operates independently, free from legislative or executive influence. In such systems, where safeguards against interference and corruption are firmly embedded, and where an overall culture of respect is found between and amongst the various institutions themselves, a code of conduct of this nature could function effectively. But in countries where democracy is ‘made to order’ — and that too by those whose names appear nowhere in the Constitution as governing authorities — such codes serve instead as Damocles’ swords hanging over the heads of independent judges, or those who dare to express independent thoughts, even sparingly.
In such circumstances, such a Code of Conduct may well serve more so as a tool of misuse as opposed to a shield against wrongdoing. In essence, it may be used to manufacture misconduct as opposed to regulating conduct, with its real purpose being to cull independence, remove judges who think freely, and to protect those who do not. Designed to uphold judicial independence, it could result in suppressing it.
Some may think that we are going out of our way to highlight the ‘possible’ misuse of this code, where no actual misuse has, in fact, come to light. However, in the context of a strained system already finding it hard to give a voice to the people, it is not far-fetched. In fact, in these times, if anything may be perceived as far-fetched, it would be its innocent, effective and judicious use without misapplication. And this is why it may not be improper to state that this Code, in its present form, may do wonders in established democratic orders, but may wreak havoc in others. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, in today’s world, we are ‘the others’.

Shah Mahmood has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023. In July 2024, the PTI leader was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.
Meher Bano Qureshi took to X today to announce that the PTI leader was undergoing baseline tests for the stones, which he had “lived with … for years”.
“In 2023, while incarcerated in Adiala Jail, doctors had advised surgery after his condition deteriorated. He chose not to undergo any procedures, then unwilling to do so while in solitary confinement,” she wrote.
“Since then, the stones have increased in size and surgery is now unavoidable. We await the doctors’ final report and a confirmed date for the operation,” Meher Bano added.
 






She added that Shah Mahmood also had a “cardiac emergency” while imprisoned at Kot Lakhpat Jail near Lahore earlier this year.
“What remains deeply painful is knowing that he is not alone in this suffering,” Meher Bano wrote. “Every single PTI leader and worker who has endured imprisonment over the past year has faced serious health consequences under inhumane and unjust conditions.
“Many continue to battle the effects of prolonged confinement, neglect and isolation … some of our workers have also lost their lives whilst unjustly imprisoned,” she added.
His son, Zain, said that his father had been suffering from gallbladder stones for several years and now surgery was required.
“Please pray for him, for Imran Khan sahib, Bushra Bibi, and all the imprisoned [PTI] leaders and workers,” he said.
 






Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry also took to X and wrote that Shah Mahmood has been in the hospital for several days and was visited by family members and constituents.
“If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him, then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” Chaudhry wrote. “We have not only met Shah Mahmood Qureshi but also met workers and leadership in Kot Lakhpat Jail.”

As reported, Pakistani representatives were at the airport on Thursday when they were called back by the hosts to give diplomacy with the Afghan Taliban another shot. On Wednesday, Pakistani officials had said the talks had collapsed, mainly due to the Afghan side’s refusal to give explicit guarantees that their soil would not be used by anti-Pakistan militants such as the TTP.
The development is welcome, and the tone of officials indicates that a breakthrough may be possible. For example, the FO spokesman said on Friday that Pakistan hopes for a “positive outcome” from the Nov 6 talks. A mechanism to verify the ceasefire and ensure peace at the border has been agreed to, and this can be the starting point for a more formal peace plan.
The key problem remains Pakistan’s legitimate concern that terrorist groups in Afghanistan are not being prevented from staging attacks against this country, and Kabul’s ambiguous stance on the issue. According to reports, the Taliban negotiators said they could not fully control the TTP, particularly their attacks inside Pakistan. While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s own responsibility, it is the Taliban’s duty — as the de facto government in Kabul — to stop terrorist groups from crossing over into Pakistan. If they cannot stop cross-border terrorism, how can the Taliban be expected to be taken seriously as Afghanistan’s legitimate administration?
 
 

However, the Pakistani side’s reported demand that the Taliban declare the TTP a fitna may be unrealistic. The Taliban and the TTP are cut from the same ideological cloth, hence, we should not expect any such edicts from Kabul or Kandahar.
Much will depend on what the Taliban bring to the table in Istanbul next week. Hopefully they will realise that without a verifiable mechanism and commitment to stop cross-border terrorism, long-term peace with Pakistan will be difficult. Meanwhile both sides, including high officials in Pakistan, should shun intemperate language that could imperil the parleys. While Pakistan’s stance against terrorist groups like the TTP should be clear, aggressive commentary should be avoided.
And as this paper has stated, with cooperation from Muslim states, such as Qatar and Turkiye, which have been instrumental in hosting the talks, as well as regional allies, Kabul should be pressed further on terrorism. For example, along with the TTP, the Taliban also host Al Qaeda, ETIM and IS-K. These groups have staged attacks on regional states, which is why a coordinated, transnational counterterrorism policy is needed to address the problem of militants based in Afghanistan.

• Pakistan assessing impact of deal, says Foreign Office
NEW DELHI: India and the United States on Friday inked a 10-year defence framework agreement, a deal India’s defence minister described as a “signal” of growing strategic alignment, even as warming US-China ties raised questions about the region’s geopolitical landscape.
Indian reports confirmed the defence pact was sealed at a meeting here between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his American counterpart Peter Hegseth.
The “convergence” however seemed undermined by a potentially opposite view on the Obama era encircling of China that Chinese and US presidents presented at a globally watched meeting in South Korea.
Indian newspaper The Hindu noted that the meeting of US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan “sent ripple effects to India”.
Following the talks, US tariffs on China were cut to 47 per cent, leaving India and Brazil with the highest rate at 50pc.
The paper quoted unn­amed experts as saying the US-China “G-2” alliance could significantly impact the region. Considering that Pakistan is in clover with both countries, India’s diplomatic challenges have become only that much more forbidding.
The Singh-Hegseth mee­ting was not bereft of its ironies. “The firming up of the pact came amid efforts by the two sides to repair ties that came under severe strain following Was­hington’s slapping of 50pc tariffs on Indian goods,” The Hindu reported.
Mr Singh announced on X that the signing of the deal marks a new era in their already robust defence relationship, emphasising the growing strategic convergence and the importance of their partnership in maintaining a free, open, and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.
 






Mr Hegseth stated the agreement strengthens defence ties, crucial for regional stability, deterrence, coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation. “Our defence ties have never been stronger,” he said.
 






Mr Hegseth and Mr Singh are in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting with ASEAN member states and dialogue partners.
Moments before the summit, Mr Trump ann­ounced the “G-2 will convene shortly!”.
When asked about the summit, according to The Hindu, India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was non-committal.
The spokesperson stated that the impact of the recent Trump-Xi talks on their domain was still being evaluated and he was unaware of the technicalities. When asked specifically about the G-2 reference, he suggested directing questions about US-China relations to either country.
The idea of a “G-2” to manage global issues was floated about 15 years ago during a 2009 summit between then-presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao. However, Obama never used the term, and Washington dropped the concept by 2011 as US-China tensions grew.
On his flight back to the US, Mr Trump mentioned plans to visit China in April 2026 and host Mr Xi later that year. No date is set for Trump’s India visit for the Quad Summit with PM Modi, and The Hindu suggested it won’t happen in 2025.
“The question won’t just be whether he will be part of the Quad summit in India, but whether his new ‘G-2’ plans with China will dilute the group’s agenda to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific,” The Hindu concluded.
Move being assessed
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office stated that it is too early to comment on the pact, which is currently being assessed for its implications in South Asia.
“The agreement is a recent development, implemented early this morning. We are currently assessing its implications, especially concerning peace, security, and stability in South Asia,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said.

The new amendments, which will go into effect from next week, also includes the cancellation of the visa 30 days after its date of issuance in case the pilgrim has not entered the kingdom within this period.
Reducing the visa’s validity, however, will not affect the permitted duration of stay after the pilgrim arrives in Saudi Arabia. All those arriving to perform Umrah are allowed to stay for three months.
The changes were made to prevent overcrowding of pilgrims in the two holy cities during cooler months, according to Ahmed Bajafar, adviser to the National Committee for Umrah and Visit.
Although Umrah rituals are solely performed in Makkah, many Umrah pilgrims seize the chance to visit Madina during their short trip to Saudi Arabia.
In October, Riyadh introduced stricter Umrah rules, including mandatory pre-booking of accommodation and verifying transport bookings on Nusuk or Masar upon arrival. The kingdom has recently made it clear that holders of all types of visas are allo­wed to perform Umrah during their stay.

• Notes eight arrests, 30 FIRs, 23 actions initiated by FIA and cybercrime agency
• Calls for genuine, stakeholder-led reform rather than ‘bulldozing’ measures
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Press Foundation (PPF) has warned of a “bleak” year for media safety and free expression in Pakistan, documenting at least 137 confirmed incidents targeting journalists and media professionals between Jan­uary and October this year.
In a report released to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, PPF said threats ranged from physical assaults and detentions to criminal complaints, censorship orders and internet shutdowns, despite constitutional guarantees of free expression.
 
 

The PPF urged authorities to move “beyond lip service” and implement domestic and international commitments to protect press freedom, including effective use of existing safety laws and mechanisms.
The report documented 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids.
Legal pressure remained significant, with eight arrests, 30 FIRs — 22 of which invoked the Pakistan Elec­tronic Crimes Act (Peca), including the newly introduced Section 26-A on “fake information” — and 23 actions initiated by the FIA and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.
Journalists also faced intimidation, including seven threats (online and offline), three threats of legal action, seven cases of harassment, sometimes involving family members or political rhetoric, and two journalists placed on the no-fly list.
 
 

Meanwhile, censorship and rest­rictions included six suspensions of mobile or internet services, a Pemra directive, a court order blocking 27 YouTube channels (later suspended in separate proceedings) and restrict­ions on reporting outside Adiala Jail.
‘Brazen’ attacks
The PPF said political leaders’ rhetoric and government actions perpetuated a hostile climate for the press, alongside “brazen” attacks on property and the bulldozing of restrictive legislation.
It noted continued physical violence — including assaults, detentions and abductions — amid “a lack of preventive, protective and prosecutorial measures”.
The report highlighted the risks faced by journalists covering climate disasters. On Aug 30, Geo News reporter Irfanullah and cameraman Ali Arsalan were allegedly ass­aulted and forced away by Punjab Enf­orcement and Regulatory Aut­hority personnel while reporting on flood-hit residents in Faisalabad.
“In what has now appeared to become an unfortunate tactic are attempts to undermine the sanctity of physical spaces, including press clubs,” the report said.
It said police forcibly entered Quetta Press Club on March 1; men linked to a shrine dispute attacked Badin Press Club on June 2; and Islamabad’s National Press Club was raided on Oct 2, with journalists assaulted on the premises.
The PPF examined eight murders of media workers this year; six were deemed unrelated to journalistic work, while two — Abdul Latif Bal­och and Imtiaz Mir — remain inconclusive.
It called for genuine, stakeholder-led reform rather than “bulldozing” measures such as the Paki­stan Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act 2025, which drew concern over pote­ntial misuse.

• Home dept says move will help ensure PTI founder’s security, prevent untoward incidents
RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has notified that all eleven FIRs registered against former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with the violent protests of May 9, 2023, will now be tried in the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Rawalpindi.
The trials will be conducted via video link from Adiala jail, where the PTI founder remains incarcerated.
According to a notification issued by the Home Department, the decision has been made under Sections 15(2) and 21(2)(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The order directs that proceedings in all eleven FIRs — registered at various police stations, including RA Bazaar, Civil Lines, City, Waris Khan, New Town, Morgah, Sadiqabad, Saddar Wah, and Cantt — be held at the Rawalpindi ATC through video link from Adiala jail. The Home Department stated that the arrangement aims to ensure Imran Khan’s security and prevent any untoward incident during the hearings.
The fresh order replaces earlier notifications dated June 21, 2023, October 4, 2023, and November 6, 2024, which also addressed the transfer of trial venues. The last such notification was withdrawn by the Punjab government after being challenged before the Lahore High Court (LHC).
With this latest order, the government has once again sanctioned the holding of Imran Khan’s trials through remote proceedings.
An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi had earlier dismissed the PTI’s plea challenging the government’s decision to have Imran Khan appear via video link in the case pertaining to the violent protest outside the General Headquarters (GHQ) — one of the several May 9 cases. Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that the provincial government’s notification was valid and that the accused would continue to attend proceedings virtually from jail.
Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023, triggered widespread riots across Pakistan, during which government buildings and military installations — including the GHQ in Rawalpindi — were stormed and vandalised. Following the unrest, dozens of FIRs were lodged against PTI leaders and supporters under anti-terrorism provisions.
The new notification consolidates all eleven Rawalpindi district cases before the same ATC, streamlining the trial process. These cases include charges related to attacks on military installations, police stations, and public property during the May 9 riots.
The order has been circulated to key officials, including the advocate general of Punjab, the registrar of the Lahore High Court, the presiding judge of the Rawalpindi ATC, and the inspector general of prisons. It also instructs the superintendent of Adiala jail to ensure Imran Khan’s safe and secure participation via video link.
Imran Khan, who was indicted in the GHQ attack case on December 5, 2024, has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since August 2023. He was subsequently arrested in additional May 9 cases in January 2024.
The PTI founder’s legal team has consistently argued that the government’s insistence on conducting the trials through video link is politically motivated and undermines the principle of open justice. However, the provincial authorities maintain that the arrangement is strictly a security measure.
With the latest notification, the stage is now set for all pending May 9 cases in Rawalpindi to proceed simultaneously in the ATC via video link — a move that could expedite proceedings but also reignite the legal debate over the right to a fair and public trial.

• Praises sacrifices by people of KP, armed forces
• Promises Daanish schools standards will be ‘at a par with Aitchison College’
CHITRAL: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that Pakistan has secured a prominent position in the international community, acknowledging the diplomatic intervention of US President Donald Trump in helping to ease tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi in May of this year.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of a Daanish school here, the premier noted that Mr Trump’s efforts prevented a potential escalation by establishing a ceasefire between the two countries.
 
 

The prime minister reiterated his resolve to eliminate terrorism and promote peace and prosperity across the country.
He lauded the armed forces for their sacrifices and professionalism under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The premier said the patriotism of the people of KP was exemplary, particularly that of Chitral, noting that were highly educated and civilised people despite lacking educational facilities.
“That is the reason why [PML-N president and former prime minister] Mian Nawaz Sharif always took special interest in the development projects of this area [Chitral] during his tenure.”
He said that after assuming the office of the prime minister, he had planned to focus federal resources on remote areas and bring prosperity through such facilities so that KP, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir could also develop on par with Punjab and Sindh.
Daanish school
Describing the Daanish school as a special gift from the federal government to the people of Chitral, he said that residents could previously only dream of an educational institution of this quality, but now it had become a reality.
The prime minister stated that the standard of Daanish schools would in no way be lower than that of Aitchison College in Lahore.
“Completely free education, along with boarding and lodging facilities, will be provided, allowing poor and orphaned children to compete with the students of Aitchison College by receiving high-quality education,” he added.
PM Shehbaz announ­ced that construction of the Daanish school building would begin in December this year and will be completed within a year, with classes to be inaugurated by him next year.
The premier also announced several development projects for Chitral, including the establishment of a university and a state-of-the-art hospital in Upper Chitral, as well as the completion of the 153-kilometre Chitral-Shandur Road by December next year.
He further announced the completion of the gas plant project in Chitral, which had been initiated during the government of his brother, Nawaz Sharif.
Earlier, Federal Minister Amir Muqam, in his address, highlighted the performance of the PML-N government and described the prime minister’s tireless work and efforts as exemplary.
He criticised the provincial government of KP, stating that it should focus on performance-based politics rather than adopting a confrontational approach.
Later, PM Shehbaz visited Gahiret village to congratulate one of his protocol staff members on his recent marriage.

• Foreign Office insists Istanbul statement a ‘preface’, not full text of accord
• Says Taliban privately acknowledge TTP, BLA presence in Afghanistan
• Khawaja Asif hints at multi-nation monitors, says ‘terrorism must stop’
ISLAMABAD: Islamabad on Friday viewed the Istanbul agreement with Kabul as a conditional truce and a step forward, but not an end-state as it awaited the next high-level engagement with the Afghan Taliban regime scheduled for Nov 6 in Turkiye.
“Afghanistan should understand that this arrangement is a conditional truce, one which hinges on demonstrable responsibility by the Afghan side,” a senior security source said on condition of anonymity, underscoring Pakistan’s cautious optimism after five days of intense talks in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar.
The round of negotiations, which concluded earlier this week, produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations.
The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday.
The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions last month that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19.
The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home.
“The Istanbul round was initially scheduled for two days. However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistani side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Hussain Andarabi said at his weekly briefing on Friday.
“We would see these deliberations [in Istanbul] as comprehensive and all-encompassing as we move to the next stage,” Mr Andarabi added.
 






He, however, urged against critiquing the statement. “The statement released by the foreign ministry of Turkiye was a kind of covering note on the talks that were held. It should be read as a preface to a book rather than as the book itself,” he explained while responding to questions about the statement not fully reflecting the Pakistani position, especially as it missed a reference to the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan does not seek further escalation of hostilities but expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army),” Mr Andarabi said.
While the Foreign Office emphasised diplomacy, the security official was explicit about Islamabad’s conditional approach.
“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to peace and stability on its western border but equally emphasises that this ceasefire is not open-ended and not unconditional,” the official emphasised.
He added that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action, including dismantling of militant hideouts, disruption of logistical channels, arrests or prosecutions of leadership and transparent reporting through the agreed monitoring and verification mechanism”.
“If Afghanistan fails to deliver verifiable proof of agreed steps, or if militants continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, Pakistan will deem the ceasefire violated and reserves all options to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens,” he warned.
FO ‘fully engaged’
The Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was dominated by military and intelligence officials, though the Foreign Office spokesman insisted it remained fully engaged.
“Istanbul talks took place with full engagement from the Foreign Office,” Mr Andarabi said. “The deputy prime minister and foreign minister gave guidance on numerous occasions. The foreign secretary and our Afghanistan Division were also engaged. We need to dispel this impression that there is some sort of fragmentation in our government apparatus.”
Mr Andarabi also clarified that “the border remains closed for trade for now. The opening of the border for Afghan transit trade would depend on the evaluation of the security situation, and clearly that evaluation still warrants closure of the border.”
On the monitoring system, the security source said, “The monitoring and verification mechanism established under the mediators’ auspices will serve as the impartial and essential instrument to determine compliance by Afghanistan.”
Pakistan, however, remains sceptical about the Afghan Taliban’s sincerity.
“Despite repeated assurances in the past (by Afghan Taliban), there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan,” Mr Andarabi recalled.
The spokesman further disclosed that the Afghan Taliban had acknowledged the presence of TTP and BLA on Afghan soil, even if they offered excuses for inaction. “As far as the acknowledgement of their physical presence in Afghanistan is concerned, they agreed to it,” he said.
Security officials echoed that scepticism, while noting that “the single litmus test of Taliban sincerity is that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan”.
Multi-nation monitors
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its long-term sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months.
He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this, it means they have connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” he said.
To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the TTP to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Mr Asif: “They accept this privately.”
He said the two were very entangled, and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban. They (TTP) won’t be living in hotels,” he added.
Mr Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul.
“There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan,: he said, stressing that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire cannot be
effective”.

The returns received until Oct 31, which is the last date for the filing of tax returns for the tax year 2025.
An official announcement of the FBR said that, as per the directions of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, no blanket extension in the filing deadline has been granted. However, taxpayers facing genuine hardships may approach their respective field formations through FBR’s IRIS system for an extension in filing their returns.
Out of the filed returns, 3.6m taxpayers filed returns with tax payments, reflecting an 18.6pc rise in taxpayers who contributed revenue along with their returns, compared to the same period in 2024.
Moreover, individual taxpayers have paid nearly Rs9 billion more than last year, growing from Rs60bn to Rs69bn this year, representing a 15pc increase in tax payments from individuals.

Individual tax payments up 15 per cent to Rs69 billion

This recorded a significant increase in income tax return filings for tax year 2025, marking a new milestone in voluntary compliance and taxpayer awareness.
The FBR appreciates the growing cooperation of citizens and reiterates its commitment to facilitating honest taxpayers through simplified processes, digital tools, and responsive communication, ensuring that Pakistan’s tax system becomes fairer, transparent, and inclusive.
 
 

The rise in return filings is the outcome of a comprehensive outreach campaign. As part of these efforts, nationwide robocalls and WhatsApp messages were disseminated to remind citizens of their civic duty to file tax returns.
In addition, FBR sent a series of behaviourally informed messages to taxpayers using third-party data, beginning with congratulatory notes, followed by informational messages about rights and obligations, and finally cautionary reminders, with nearly 800,000 such nudges issued across the country.
Complementing these initiatives, targeted emails were also sent to around 70,000 taxpayers, highlighting the indicative income levels of comparable peers to encourage accurate and timely filing.

In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and relevant ministries.
According to the notification, the price of petrol now stands at Rs265.45 per litre from Rs263.02 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has increased to Rs278.44 per litre from Rs275.42 per litre.
Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Ogra also notified a Rs5.88 per kilogram (2.83pc) cut in LPG’s consumer price to Rs201.60 per kg (from Rs207.49 per kg).
The price of an 11.8kg cylinder has been set at Rs2,378.89 for November, down Rs69.44 from Rs2,448.53 for October. The government charges about Rs37,342 per tonne in GST and petroleum levy on LPG.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-11-01 02:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/010715166065664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952518/us-seeks-pakistans-help-to-balance-chinas-mineral-grip' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks Pakistan’s help to balance China’s mineral grip</strong></a><br><p>• Critical Minerals Forum chief meets Aurangzeb
• Islamabad welcomes move; asks team to revert with a detailed framework for collaboration
ISLAMABAD: A leading US delegation met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Friday, seeking to build secure and transparent mineral supply chains for American industry amid Washington’s growing concerns over China’s upper hand in global rare earth materials.
The delegation led by Robert Louis Strayer II, president of the US government-funded Critical Minerals Forum (CMF), “discussed avenues of cooperation in the minerals and mining sector, strengthening supply-chain security, and encouraging responsible and sustainable investment in Pakistan’s critical minerals landscape” with a Pakistani team headed by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to an official statement.
 






The meeting took place as the US and India announced a 10-year defence framework agreement.
The CMF’s focus is driven by the strategic threat posed by Beijing’s control over key resources. “China’s dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives,” Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website.
Mr Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for US industry, particularly in emerging markets.
The forum, he said, “focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives”.
He also promised a commitment to support technology transfer, intel­lectual property protection, and US private-sector investor confidence.
Mr Strayer noted that the US viewed Pakistan’s science, engineering, and mathematics talent as a competitive advantage and “acknowledged Pakistan’s potential to become a future hub for critical mineral development,” the statement added.
Natalie Baker, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Islamabad who accompanied the delegation, noted the Embassy’s support for American commercial engagement in Pakis­tan and “emphasised the importance of ensuring strong investor confidence and enabling regulatory frameworks in the minerals sector”.
In response, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan is working on significant legal and regulatory reforms and would welcome structured proposals. “We encourage you to return with a detailed framework for collaboration. Pakistan will evaluate it with a view to facilitating responsible investment and ensuring mutual benefit,” the minister said.
Mr Aurangzeb also positioned Pakistan as navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, highlighting its strengthened partnerships. “Pakistan today stands at a constructive intersection of global relationships—renewed momentum in Pakistan-US ties, time-tested relations with China, and forward-looking strategic cooperation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he said.
He stressed that Pakistan’s mineral sector represents a “transformational opportunity” that could shift the country from “consumption-driven cycles to export-led growth.”
He added, “A strong minerals policy framework will help Pakistan break the cycle of periodic balance-of-payments pressures and reduce future reliance on multilateral support.”
The minister also updated the delegation that during his recent visit to Washington he met multiple global financial institutions, including Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), which expressed interest in expanding investments in Pakistan.
US stakeholders are concerned about China’s growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US under-investment.
 
 

According to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.
The Atlantic Council warned that these “supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption.” It noted that China has shown a “willingness to weaponise its dominance”, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.
However, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the “unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices”.
He added that this uncertainty has “a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profits.”

Saim smashed an unbeaten 71 off 38, hitting six fours and five sixes, to help Pakistan chase down the paltry 111-run target in the 14th over.
Earlier, Faheem Ashraf and Salman Mirza had kept South Africa quiet with a brilliant pace bowling show.
Pakistan openers Sahibzada Farhan and Saim had seen the side cruise to 49-0 by the end of the powerplay with a measured approach with no pressure on them whatsoever.
 






But right at the end of the period, Corbin Bosch trapped Sahibzada lbw with his pace. However, the incoming Babar Azam triggered raucous roars among the capacity crowds, getting off the mark with a scintillating cover drive.
Saim too carried on, launching Ottneil Baartman for a huge six over long-on as Pakistan edged closer to the small target.
The southpaw followed that up with a powerful cut through the off-side for four and an audacious flick for yet another maximum, milking a 21 runs from the ninth over.
Saim brought up his first T20I half century on home soil in 29 balls in the next over — which also saw him lift spinner Donovan Ferreira over the covers for six — as Pakistan posted 92-1 at halfway stage.
After Babar became highest T20I-run scorer — beating India’s Rohit Sharma with 4323 tuns in 123 matches — Saim dispatched George Linde and Ferreira for sixes to take Pakistan over the line.
 






Earlier, Pakistan put up a fast-bowling masterclass as South Africa were bundled out cheaply after they were put into bat.
Faheem took 4-23 while Salman — replacing Shaheen Shah Afridi in the Pakistan XI — returned figures of 3-14 and Naseem Shah chipped in with 2-28.
South Africa’s best batting display came from Dewald Brevis, but the right-hander’s burst was too short to lead the visitors to a competitive total.
They reeled at 31-4 by the end of the powerplay as Salman rattled their top-order with immaculate line and length and subtle movement.
The left-armer struck as early as on the second ball of the match, bamboozling South African opener Reeza Hendricks — who hit a match-winning half century in the first match — with an in-swinger that crashed into the stumps.
Naseem pushed the Proteas deeper into trouble, deceiving Quinton de Kock with a slower one, which the right-hander holed to Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha at mid-off.
Salman then returned to get Tony de Zorzi caught at deep fine before castling Matthew Breetzke with a stunning off-cutter.
 






The incoming Brevis, one of the most promising prospects in global T20 cricket, went after the Pakistan bowlers to bring back South Africa in the game, dispatching spinners Mohammad Nawaz and Abrar Ahmed and medium-pacer Faheem  for handsome sixes, but was undone by a shorter ball by Faheem to depart with 25 off 16 against his name.
Faheem then returned to make South African captain Ferreira drag the ball on to his stumps just at the halfway stage, to leave the visitors at 66-6.
 






The right-armer returned to send back Linde in the same manner two overs later.
South Africa’s struggles only kept on increasing, with Naseem producing a caught-behind dismissal of Bosch in the 14th over.
Abrar Ahmed got himself in the wickets column, thanks to a carrom ball that clipped Nandre Burger’s off-stump before Faheem came back to be gifted a fourth and South Africa’s last wicket on the second ball of the 20th over.
Pakistan will look to win the series when they take on South Africa in the third and final match at the same venue on Saturday.</p><small>2025-10-31 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631523-sindh-extends-deadline-for-ajrak-themed-number-plate-until-dec-31' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh extends deadline for Ajrak-themed number plate</strong></a><br><p>

Last year, talks between the government and the PTI commenced in the last week of December to bring down political temperatures, but despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process hardly moved forward on major issues — the formation of a judicial commission and the release of PTI prisoners.
From December into January, the PML-N-led coalition and the PTI accused each other of derailing the negotiations and lacking seriousness. A highly demanded meeting of the PTI team with party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan in Adiala Jail on January 12 paved the way for a third round of talks. However, the PTI decided to boycott the fourth round of talks with the government, a day after it announced that Imran issued directions to call off negotiations due to a delay over the formation of judicial commissions.
Speaking on Dawn News programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, the PTI chairman denied that talks were taking place and said it was “unfortunate” that political issues were not being resolved with political solutions. He also recalled the history of talks between the PTI and the government, which did not bear fruit.
“When we announced that our mandate was stolen in March 2024, [Imran] Khan sahib formed a committee to hold talks, but when the talks did not take place, people said ‘ýou only want to talk to the establishment’,” Gohar said.
“Khan sahib said that [Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief] Mahmood Khan Achakzai sahib should hold talks; if he brings us any offer, we will consider it,” he added.
 


The PTI chairman noted that another committee was formed on November 26, but recalled that no talks were conducted and said the government did “not take the issue seriously”.
“Even when we and the government formed committees after November 26, we could not meet for two weeks,” he said. “They did not want to meet us after that. In these circumstances, we did not want to sit and gossip for a photo opportunity.”
“We wanted to bring some issues to the table because we understood that if we found a political solution to the political issues facing the country, it would be much better for democracy, for the House and it would be better for both parties if we progressed this way. But it didn’t happen, so the matter didn’t move forward.”
Speaking about military operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gohar said that the PTI held multiple all-party conferences on the issue and held the conferences in January, July and September this year.
“Intelligence-based operations are referenced in our press releases, but there cannot be collateral damage or politicisation,” he explained. “People displaced in prior operations have still not rebuilt their homes.”</p><small>2025-10-31 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31204339d7a0d0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952376/defence-minister-khawaja-asif-rubbishes-contentious-remarks-about-disarming-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif rubbishes contentious remarks about disarming Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday rubbished and strongly condemned the contentious remarks made by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry regarding the role of Pakistani troops in the Gaza peace force, which also included the disarming of Hamas.
Addressing the remarks by the federal parliamentary secretary for information and broadcasting in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister said: “I will say God forbid on all these three remarks; what kind of statement has he given. Nothing from this is our target or suits us.”
In an interview on Tuesday on Ary News show ‘11th Hour’, Chaudhry had said regarding the mandate of the Gaza peace force: “Pakistan and the other countries that will be chosen will make sure there is no extremism or violence … or that there is no cross-border attack. Pakistan will enforce that.”
Chaudhry also said that the security of any Pakistani soldier deputed for duty in the force would be the utmost priority. “We will fulfil our duty and protect Muslim brothers and make sure there are no cross-border violations or terrorism.”
Questioned if the mandate would also include the disarmament of Hamas, Chaudhry had said: “Yes absolutely, if [Hamas] will be disarmed, only then the other force will be able to carry on. Things will only move forward after disarmament.”
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Addressing the matter while slamming Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said Pakistan would follow whatever collective decision is taken for the force. He also questioned on whose behalf the federal parliamentary secretary was speaking in terms of enforcing peace.
“I have no information about this. I am frankly speaking that if we are saying such things on a personal level on any TV [channel] then it is inappropriate.”
Questioned if the role of the force was really as per Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said: “I won’t be in favour then. There has been no discussion like this.”
He agreed when asked that the inclusion of any Pakistani troops in such a force in the face of continued Israeli bombing would cause a complicated situation.
 
 

Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, have said discussions within the government and military establishment are at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility. Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counter-terrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment. “Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.
Asif had said on Tuesday that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”.
Afghan Taliban issue
Meanwhile, on the recent agreement with the Afghan Taliban to continue the current ceasefire ahead of further talks and the agreeement on a monitoring and verification mechanism for any violation, Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its longterm sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months.
He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this then it means they have a connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” the defence minister said.
To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Asif: “They accept this privately.”
He said the two were very entangled and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban, thry (TTP) won’t be living in hotels.”</p><small>2025-10-31 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311920317424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952369/punjab-govt-under-fire-for-manipulating-air-quality-data' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt under fire for ‘manipulating’ air quality data</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government is facing criticism and allegations of data manipulation after climate analysts and social media users accused the Environment Protection & Climate Change Department (EPCCD) of deliberately shutting down air quality monitoring stations in Lahore during peak pollution hours.
The controversy erupted when climate and public policy analyst Dawar Hameed Butt posted a series of tweets on X, alleging that the EPCCD had turned off several monitoring stations, particularly those in the more polluted northern and eastern parts of the city.
“EPCCD Punjab has turned off Monitoring Stations in Lahore,” Butt tweeted. “The ones left on are still ‘Beyond Index’. These are PAS officers, PhDs and ‘educated’ staff, and they think closing their eyes will solve the problem. Absolute failure unfolding now.”
 






He supported his claims with screenshots from the official government website, aqipunjab.com, which showed that data from multiple stations had not been updated for hours, still displaying readings from October 30.
The allegations were echoed by another social media user, Hassan Aftab, who suggested a “strategic motive behind the alleged shutdowns.”
“Punjab government’s new air quality strategy: if pollution levels look bad, just turn off the monitors. [Eight] out of 10 monitors are shut beyond 10pm in Lahore (when air quality dips further) to lower the average. Lahore now breathing the cleaner air (on paper),” he tweeted.
Aftab tagged Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, urging transparency. “Let’s ensure there’s uninterrupted data from the monitors; it will only help you better strategise on how to solve this,” he added, noting the millions already spent on the monitoring infrastructure.
 






In a post on X, the EPCCD stated that due to a technical issue, AQI monitoring at some stations had been interrupted.
“[A] technical team is working to restore regular data transmission. Current and any missing AQI data from Air Quality Monitoring Stations will be available soon,” the post read.
 






When checked by Dawn at 5pm on Friday, the aqipunjab.com website appeared to have updated most stations, with only the Multan Road station lagging. However, the updated data itself painted a grim picture of the province’s air quality, underscoring the critical need for reliable monitoring.
At that time, Kasur was ranked the most polluted city in Punjab with an AQI soaring to a hazardous level of 500. Other major cities also recorded unhealthy air, with Gujranwala at 207, DG Khan at 190, Multan at 187 and Lahore at 175.
In response to the allegations, EPCCD spokesperson Sajid Bashir firmly denied the claims and told Dawn that the department updates air quality levels on an hourly basis and dismissed the social media users’ accusations as “false claims.”
Bashir rejected the screenshots shared by Dawar and others, asserting the department’s commitment to providing accurate data.
Earlier this week, Lahore continued to rank as the most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to the global monitor IQAir.
In response to the crisis, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has also launched a large-scale anti-smog operation, deploying 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers, and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling.
Meanwhile, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, praised the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in handling the anti-smog operations, calling her hard work “a testament to the success of the vision of improving the environment”.
“In the coming years, Punjab will see improvements like Beijing,” she said.
‘Brief technical glitch’
Aurangzeb, in a statement released later in the day, said there was a “brief technical glitch” in the air quality monitoring network earlier today.
“It was immediately flagged by the EPA’s Smog War Room, and the vendor resolved it by 3:00 p.m. the same day. The issue was purely technical, not administrative, and was transparently announced on the official portal,” said the statement.
Praising the monitoring system, the minister said that the fact that the brief technical interruption was noticed “shows how widely trusted and publicly relied upon our system has become”.
Aurangzeb maintained that if the government wished to hide the air quality date, it would not have installed 41 monitoring stations across Punjab.

The PPP chairman’s remarks come amidst the party preparing to move a no-confidence motion against the current AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq, after the PPP’s ranks in the 53-member AJK legislative Assembly swelled to 27 after ten — all elected on PTI tickets in the July 2021 general elections — from the forward bloc joined the party on Sunday.
Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Bilawal said that his party “was in a position to form a government in Kashmir, being a majority,” while reaffirming that the party remained committed to “resolving the issues of Kashmir and honouring the hopes and dreams of its people.”
“Whatever the issues are, PPP has a reputation for finding political solutions,” Bilawal asserted.
The PPP Chairman acknowledged that the current legislative assembly, until the elections, will be a “test” for the PPP.
Bilawal vowed that “PPP’s foundation was laid down in the name of the Kashmir cause,” adding that “three generations of the PPP leaders have struggled for the cause’ on both national and international levels.
He continued: “We all know what the conditions were in the last elections, it was Khan sahib’s govt, and (we know) the role the establishment had at the time; however, even in those times, I’m proud of PPP representatives in AJK. PPP won the election, but overnight their victory was taken away; the same script was applied in Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well.”
He regretted that “due to non-political behaviour and mindset, a vacuum was created in AJK, as a result of which, the people are being harmed,” he said, cautioning that it may also “pose a threat” to the Kashmir cause on the international level.
He asserted that PPP “was the sole party which is capable of representing Kashmir within the country as well as internationally.”
He vowed to give a “befitting response” to any conspiracy against AJK.
“I promise the people of Kashmir that I will not disappoint you,” he concluded.
While a joint no-confidence motion against AJK PM — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
On Thursday, after days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif endorsed the plan.
Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by the PPP chairman.
On Monday, addressing a press conference with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah today, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira had said: “It has been decided that the current AJK govt, which we both parties were part of, has become a basis of creating a crisis instead of solving problems.”
“Now there is a consensus of opinion that a no-confidence motion will be brought against it on which the PPP and PML-N will be together,” Kaira added.
Meanwhile, incumbent AJK PM Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can.
A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31161802f1ff745.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952295/kp-cm-sohail-afridis-all-male-13-member-cabinet-takes-oath-of-office-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi’s all-male, 13-member cabinet takes oath of office in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>A 13-member provincial cabinet picked by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took the oath of office on Friday in Peshawar.
According to a statement from the KP government, the cabinet’s swearing-in ceremony took place at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
“KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath,” the statement said. “Those sworn in as provincial ministers included Meena Khan Afridi, Arshad Ayub Khan, Amjad Ali, Aftab Alam Afridi, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Khaleequr Rehman, Riaz Khan, Syed Fakhar Jehan, Aqibullah Khan and Faisal Khan Tarakai.
“KP Governor Kundi congratulated the newly sworn-in provincial ministers and expressed his best wishes to them,” it added.
According to an earlier summary sent to the KP governor by the provincial government, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, CM Afridi had selected his cabinet members, while also picking Muzammil Aslam and Taj Muhammad as advisers, and Shafi Jan as a special assistant.
The PTI’s KP chapter had also confirmed the names in a post on social media platform X.
 






Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra congratulated the new provincial cabinet and wished them all the best.
 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive earlier this month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly were criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631462-petition-in-shc-seeks-40-tax-exemption-on-sanitary-napkins' target='_blank'><strong>Petition in SHC seeks 40% tax exemption on sanitary napkins</strong></a><br><p>
