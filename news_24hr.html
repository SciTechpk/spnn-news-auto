According to the Form-56 of the election results, the government candidate Sanaullah won after getting 250 votes.
The opposition completely boycotted the election process. Out of 363 members of the assembly, 251 cast their votes, and one vote was rejected.
Sanaullah and the opposition’s Salma Ijaz, wife of disqualified candidate Ejaz Chaudhry, were in the fray. PTI had announced a boycott of the Senate by-election for the seat that fell vacant due to the disqualification of party senator Chaudhry.
The government alliance had a majority of 263 voters, while the opposition had the support of 100 voters. The polling process in the Punjab Assembly continued uninterrupted from 9 am to 4 pm, in which 251 voters exercised their right to vote.
Addressing the media after his victory, Sanaullah said, “PTI did not choose to boycott the democratic process but chose to escape from the elections.
“Their boycott of the elections is a lack of confidence in their members.”
He also condemned the attack on Aleema Khan during his interaction with the media.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari were also present at the Assembly to vote for Sanaullah.
Earlier in the month, according to PTI’s media wing, the annou­ncement to boycott was made by the expected candidate Ejaz. She made it clear that she will not contest the by-election as she does not want to become part of the ‘fraudulent elections’.
Twelve PTI lawmakers in Punjab had been disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9, 2023 cases. The disqualified lawmakers comprise eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly legislators. The NA-129, Lahore, fell vacant on the death of MNA and former governor Mian Azhar.
PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan has barred his party from contesting the by-polls except on NA-129 where Azhar’s son Hammad Azhar is likely to be the party’s candidate.
“We will not field any candidates in the by-elections for the seats of our unjustly disqualified members. These individuals stood firm with PTI despite extreme challenges. Therefore, the party will completely boycott these by-elections,” Mr Khan had said in a recent tweet.
Azma Bokhari claimed the PTI had already fled the by-election arena. “The PTI is unable to find candidates willing to face PML-N in the field,” she added.</p><small>2025-09-09 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/09151015996fed7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940697/heavy-showers-gusty-winds-expected-in-karachi-today-and-tomorrow-2-teenagers-die-due-to-electrocution' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy showers, gusty winds expected in Karachi today and tomorrow; 2 teenagers die due to electrocution</strong></a><br><p>Karachi was expected to experience heavy rain and gusty winds today and tomorrow, the Met Office said in a new forecast, adding that “torrential rains” could cause urban flooding and waterlogging in the city’s low-lying areas. Meanwhile, two teenagers lost their lives due to electrocution during the downpour.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that a deep depression system that was to cause rain in the city had weakened into a depression that was now lying over central Sindh. It would continue to move nearly west/ southwest-ward and gradually further weaken into a well-marked low pressure area during next 12 hours, the PMD added.
“Due to this system strong monsoon currents are continually penetrating in the province. Under its influence, widespread rain-wind/ thundershower with strong gusty winds along with scattered heavy to very heavy/ isolated exceptional
heavy falls are expected in … Karachi division till tomorrow with occasional gaps.”

The Met Office warned that “torrential rains” could cause urban flooding and water logging in low-lying areas of Karachi.
A day earlier, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham said that “heavy to very heavy” rain was expected in the city today in four to six spells from the morning till night.
Electrocution deaths
On Tuesday, officials also reported two deaths due to electrocution.
Sohrab Goth Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Marwat told Dawn.com that  that “a 17-year-old boy died due to electric shocks at a water filter plant in the Ayub Goth area.”
Separately, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri SHO Sarfraz Commando told Dawn.com that “an 18-year-old also died because of electric shocks inside his home in Rasheedabad.”
Later, K-Electric issued a statement maintaining that preliminary investigations showed its “infrastructure was not involved” in either of the incidents.
Tariq Road declared no-parking zone
Earlier, the city’s traffic police took the pre-emptive measure of declaring both sides of Tariq Road “no-parking zone”.
The traffic police posted on X that the Met Office had predicted heavy rain and urban flooding for September 9 (today), in view of which “citizens,  as well as all market associations, their members, and administrations are informed that both sides of Tariq Road have been declared no-parking zone”.
 






The police said the step was taken so that Tariq Road could be used as an alternative route in case Sharea Faisal, one of the city’s main arteries, “is affected”.
“Citizens, especially market associations and members, are requested to avoid parking on both sides of Tariq Road so that traffic flow is not hampered.”
 






Earlier in the morning, the traffic police reported drizzle in parts of the city.
It advised commuters to exercise caution and warned them of slippery roads.
 






The traffic police also advised people against travelling to low-lying areas.
Meanwhile, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho instructed zonal deputy inspector generals and district senior superintendent of police to brief their subordinates and relevant officials about assistance that was to provide in case of rain. He also directed them to coordinate with all relevant departments.
According to a statement issued by the police, he further asked them to inform the residents of low-lying areas, especially those living alongside rivers and nullahs, about the weather situation so that precautionary measures could be taken.
“All possible cooperation with the traffic police should be ensured,” he said, adding that routes alternatives to the ones affected by rain should be checked.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s (CM) House said the city administration was put on alert on the directives of CM Murad Ali Shah.
It quoted Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah as saying that district administrations and local body departments should “go out in the field” to assist citizens and stay prepared for the rain spell.
He directed assistant commissioners and municipal commissioners to check the drainage of nullahs, adding that arrangements should be made for  having equipment required for rainwater drainage.

“Machines provided by the PDMA (provincial disaster management authority) should be ready for drainage.”
Mayor details preparatory measures
On Monday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab addressed a  press confernece, where he detailed precautionary measures taken in view of the rain forecast.
He said that despite precautionary measures, it was inevitable the city would take “a few hours” to recover after each downpour .
Outlining the city’s preparedness, limitations and political landscape amid the ongoing monsoon spell predicted to continue through Sept 8-10.
“The sea level is high — it might not take the water,” he explained, adding that this natural phenomenon was among the city’s biggest challenges during heavy rainfall.
Highlighting the city’s preparedness, the mayor claimed that all 46 major drains (nullahs) under Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) leading to the sea had been “cleaned”, including the Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs.
“Additional pumps have been installed, machinery deployed, and 120 water and sewerage vehicles are active across the city,” he said.
Relief camps have been set up at key choke points to provide stranded citizens with water and biscuits, and municipal staff leave has been cancelled to ensure 24/7 field presence.
The mayor urged residents to remain calm and patient, advising them not to rush out during the rain.
Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.

Qatar said Israeli strikes targeted the homes of several members of Hamas’s political bureau residing in the Gulf country, where the group’s senior leadership is based.
“The IDF (Israeli military) and ISA (security agency) conducted a precise strike targeting the senior leadership of the Hamas terrorist organisation,” the Israeli military said, without specifying where the strike took place.
An Israeli military official told AFP that the military had carried out air strikes. “The name of the operation in Doha is Summit of Fire. These were air strikes,” a military official said.
Some Israeli media outlets reported that United States President Donald Trump had allowed the attack.
However, the Israeli prime minister’s office said, “Today’s action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.”
 






White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Al Jazeera that there was no comment from the US administration at this time on the Israeli strikes.
“The US president is likely to be the first to comment on his Truth Social platform. Additionally, we have a press briefing coming up in three and a half hours, and that is when the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will have the opportunity to answer a lot of questions,” she said, adding that “whether the US commander in chief greenlighted this attack on Qatar — where the US has a military base — or not, is something for speculation at the moment.”
Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari slammed the attack, saying: “The State of Qatar strongly condemns the cowardly Israeli attack that targeted residential buildings housing several members of the Political Bureau of Hamas in the Qatari capital, Doha. This criminal assault constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qataris and residents in Qatar.”
 






He said the security forces, civil defence and relevant authorities immediately began addressing the incident and taking necessary measures to contain its repercussions and ensure the safety of the residents and surrounding areas.
“While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behaviour and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty. Investigations are underway at the highest level, and further details will be announced as soon as they are available,” the spokesperson said.
A senior Hamas source told Al Jazeera that leaders of the group were targeted while discussing United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Israeli media, citing a senior Israeli official, said the attack was aimed at top Hamas leaders, including Khalil al-Hayya, its Gaza chief.
A Hamas source told Al Jazeera that all members attending the meeting survived Israel’s assassination attempt.
Smoke was seen rising over the Katara District in the capital, an eyewitness said.

Plumes of black smoke were billowing from the city’s Legtifya petrol station. Right next door to the petrol station is a small residential compound that has been guarded by Qatar’s emiri guard 24 hours a day since the beginning of the Gaza conflict.
 


Ambulances and at least 15 police and unmarked government cars thronged the streets around the blast site an hour after the strike.
AJ reported the head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) condemned the “heinous” Israeli attack on the Qatari capital, saying it “constitutes a serious violation of international law and the sovereignty of the State of Qatar”.
“It is considered a threat to security and stability in the region,” PLO Secretary General Hussein al-Sheikh said in a statement.
United Arab Emirates Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan condemned in the “strongest terms the blatant and cowardly Israeli attack”, stressing that the “reckless attack constitutes a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty, a dangerous assault on international law and the UN Charter, and an irresponsible escalation that threatens regional and international security and stability”.
He expressed the UAE’s full solidarity with Qatar and its unwavering support for everything that would protect its security and the safety of its citizens and residents.
He also stressed the need for an immediate end to the military escalation, warning that the continuation of such escalatory actions would undermine regional security and drag the region down “dangerous paths that would have disastrous repercussions for international peace and security”.
The UAE official called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council, to shoulder its legal and moral responsibilities to deter Israel and “halt these barbaric Israeli attacks, stressing that the continuation of this aggressive approach reflects reckless behaviour that will push the region towards further tension and escalation, undermining the chances of achieving security and stability”.
 






His Highness warned that continuing such reckless attacks, in the absence of a deterrent and decisive international stance, will have extremely dangerous repercussions for
“This extremely dangerous and criminal action is a gross violation of all international rules and regulations, a violation of Qatar’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei told state TV.
Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, which has fought alongside Hamas in Gaza, condemned Israel’s targeting of its ally’s leaders.
Israel’s “targeting of a meeting of leaders of … Hamas in the Qatari capital, Doha, is a blatant criminal act that violates all human standards and values, as well as the most basic international laws and norms”, Islamic Jihad said in a statement.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich praised the targeting of Hamas leaders.
“Terrorists have no immunity and will never have immunity from Israel’s long arm anywhere in the world,” Smotrich wrote on X, hailing a “right decision and a perfect execution by the IDF (Israeli military) and the Shin Bet (security agency)”.
The US embassy in Qatar told citizens to shelter in place.
 






The strikes come less than two weeks after armed forces chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir vowed to target the group’s leaders based abroad.
“Most of Hamas’s leadership is abroad, and we will reach them as well,” Zamir had said on August 31.
Hamas and Israel have held multiple rounds of indirect ceasefire negotiations brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States throughout the nearly two-year Gaza conflict.
Despite two temporary truces, the talks have failed to bring a lasting end to the fighting that has led to over 64,000 Palestinians killed.
Trump said on Sunday he was issuing a “last warning” to Hamas, saying the Palestinian group must accept a deal to release Israeli prisoners.
“The Israelis have accepted my terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning,” he had said on social media.
“We had some very good discussions. Good things could happen,” he told reporters. “I think we’re going to have a deal on Gaza very soon.”
In response to Trump’s comments, Hamas had said it was ready to “immediately sit at the negotiating table” following “some ideas received from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire agreement”.
In exchange for a truce, Hamas said it wanted “a clear declaration of the end of the war, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the formation of a committee of independent Palestinians to manage the Gaza Strip, which would begin its duties immediately”.
Hamas had agreed last month to a ceasefire proposal that involved a 60-day truce and staggered prisoner releases.
Israel, however, has demanded that Hamas release all the prisoners at once, disarm itself and relinquish control of Gaza, among other conditions.
Today’s attack came as Israel stepped up a deadly assault on Gaza City, the Palestinian territory’s largest urban centre.
On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video statement addressing residents of the city: “I say to the residents: you have been warned, leave now!
“All of this is just a prelude, just the opening, to the main intensified operation — the ground manoeuvre of our forces, who are now organising and assembling to enter Gaza City.“</p><small>2025-09-09 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/09170837fc75847.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940752/kp-govt-to-introduce-teaching-licences-for-improving-school-education' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt to introduce teaching licences for improving school education</strong></a><br><p>School teachers across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will soon require a licence to continue teaching, as part of the government’s efforts to ensure high educational standards, the province’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said on Tuesday.
Last year, Sindh became the first province to introduce a teaching licence test under its teaching licence policy — introduced in 2023 — in a bid to ensure a higher calibre of educators in schools.
According to a notification issued by the department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “only registered and licensed teachers will be authorised to teach at schools”, for which the education department will set up a regulatory body.
The regulatory body will be responsible for issuing licences, as well as renewing them based on the teachers’ performance, the notification said.
The establishment of the licensing regulatory body aims to “improve the quality of education”, enhance student learning outcomes, by ensuring that only “licensed and professionally qualified” teachers are allowed to teach at schools.
The 15-member body will oversee the development and implementation of a standardised licensing framework, as well as develop robust teaching standards via routine performance evaluations and reviews.
The education department has allocated a budget of Rs200 million for the establishment of the regulatory body.
KP’s education system has been facing persistent challenges. In November last year, over 5,200 community-school teachers in remote girls’ schools went without pay for eight months, disrupting the education of 276,000 students last year.
This was followed by textbook shortages at the start of the new academic year, leaving students and teachers without essential materials. More recently, 15 principals were suspended after poor SSC exam results, underscoring gaps in school leadership and oversight.

It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May this year.
While players from both sides have shared cordial relations over the years despite geopolitical realities, both captains were asked if they would instruct their players to dial down their aggression, considering the larger context.
“You don’t need to say anything to any player because every individual is different,” a relaxed-looking Salman said at the captains’ pre-tournament media interaction in Dubai on Tuesday.
“If someone wants to be aggressive in the field, they are more than welcome to do that.
“When it comes to fast bowlers, they are always aggressive and you can’t stop them because that’s what keeps them going.
“So from my side, there is no instruction to anyone as long as it stays in the ground.”
While Indian captain Suryakumar said, “Aggression (is) always there when we take the field.
“Without (some degree of) aggression, I don’t think you can play the sport. I’m really excited to take the field.”
The tournament trophy was also unveiled by ACC President Mohsin Naqvi at a ceremony with team captains ahead of the tournament’s first encounter today between Afghanistan and Hong Kong.
 






While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan in the final of a tri-series, also involving hosts United Arab Emirates, on Sunday.
 
 

India have not played T20 Internationals since the home series against England in February but Suryakumar would not call his team undercooked.
“Well, if your preparations are great then you are certainly confident when you take the field,” he said.
“Yes, we are playing after quite a while, but we came here three-four days back, and we had a good time as a team together. Really looking forward to this tournament.”</p><small>2025-09-09 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/091742442b2aa45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940754/pta-denies-breaches-in-licensed-sector-after-reported-sim-data-leak' target='_blank'><strong>PTA denies breaches in licensed sector after reported SIM data leak</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Tuesday said its audit found no breaches in the licensed telecom sector following reports of a mobile SIM data leak.
Media reports claimed that the data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was up for sale, with mobile location information priced at Rs500, call and data records at Rs2,000, and details of foreign trips at Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan were stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184m unique account credentials.
Responding to the matter today, the PTA said it had taken notice of the media reports on the alleged availability of subscriber data online.
“PTA clarifies it does not hold or manage subscriber data, which remains solely with licensed operators.
“Initial review shows the reported datasets include family details, travel records, vehicle registrations, and CNIC copies, indicating aggregation from multiple external sources, not telecom operators. PTA’s audits have found no breaches within the licensed sector,” the authority said.
It added that in its ongoing crackdown on unlawful content, it had blocked 1,372 sites, apps and social media pages involved in selling or sharing personal data.
The PTA pointed out that the Ministry of Interior has already formed an inquiry committee, which is probing into the matter.
In March 2024, a joint investigation team formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7m people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.</p><small>2025-09-09 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622797-eight-firefighters-injured-as-massive-blaze-engulfs-karachi-factory' target='_blank'><strong>Eight firefighters injured as massive blaze engulfs Karachi factory</strong></a><br><p>

Oli’s government lifted the ban after protests intensified on Monday, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to storm parliament. Nineteen people were killed and more than 100 injured in the unrest.
But there was no let up in the protests on Tuesday, forcing Oli to quit and plunging Nepal into fresh political uncertainty.
 


The unrest is the worst in decades in the poor Himalayan country that is wedged between India and China and has struggled with political instability and economic uncertainty since protests led to the abolition of its monarchy in 2008.
“In view of the adverse situation in the country, I have resigned effective today to facilitate the solution to the problem and to help resolve it politically in accordance with the constitution,” Oli said in his resignation letter to President Ramchandra Paudel.
An aide to Paudel told Reuters the resignation had been accepted and the president had begun the “process and discussions for a new leader”.
The army posted an appeal on X asking people to “exercise restraint” since Oli’s resignation had been accepted.
Oli, 73, was sworn in for his fourth term in July last year as the country’s 14th prime minister since 2008. Two of his cabinet colleagues resigned late on Monday, saying they did not want to continue on moral grounds.

Earlier on Tuesday, Oli had called a meeting of all political parties, saying violence was not in the interest of the nation and “we have to resort to peaceful dialogue to find solutions to any problem”.
Oli had also said he was saddened by the incidents of violence due to the “infiltration from different selfish centres”. He did not respond directly to the protesters’ complaints about corruption.
But anger against the government showed no signs of abating, as protesters gathered in front of parliament and other places in the capital Kathmandu, in defiance of an indefinite curfew imposed by authorities.
The protesters set fire to tyres on some roads, threw stones at police personnel in riot gear and chased them through narrow streets, while some looked on and shot videos of the clashes on their mobile phones as thick black smoke rose to the sky.
Witnesses also said that protesters were setting fire to the homes of some politicians in Kathmandu, and local media reported that some ministers were plucked to safety by military helicopters.
Reuters could not immediately verify the information.

Main airport shut
Kathmandu airport, Nepal’s main international gateway, was closed with immediate effect as smoke from fires nearby set by protesters could endanger the safety of aircraft, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said.
“We are still standing here for our future … We want this country corruption-free so that everyone can easily access education, hospitals, medical (facilities) … and for a bright future,” protester Robin Sreshtha told Reuters TV.
Organisers of the protests, which spread to other cities in the Himalayan country, have called them “demonstrations by Gen Z”, driven by young people’s widespread frustration with the government’s perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.
“The protest was intended, first and foremost, against the rampant corruption in government,” a protester said in an email to Reuters, signing off as “A concerned Nepali citizen”.
Young Nepalis had been putting out social media posts about the “luxurious lives of the families and children of corrupt politicians and civil servants” and the government responded by clamping down on social media platforms, the email said.
Neighbour India, which is home to hundreds of thousands of Nepali migrant workers, said it hoped that all concerned will exercise restraint and resolve issues through talks.
A joint statement by the embassies of Australia, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, and the US in Nepal urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid further escalation and ensure fundamental rights are protected.
Last week, Oli’s government imposed a social media ban blocking access to several online platforms after it said the platforms had failed to register themselves with the government.
Critics said it was an attempt to throttle free speech, a charge the government denies, citing misuse of social media to spread disinformation and commit fraud, among other concerns.</p><small>2025-09-09 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/09170807a813068.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940749/drap-orders-withdrawal-of-antibiotic-drip-anarob-batch-over-unsafe-bacterial-toxins' target='_blank'><strong>Drap orders withdrawal of antibiotic drip Anarob batch over unsafe bacterial toxins</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Drug Regulatory Authority (Drap) on Tuesday ordered the withdrawal of a batch of Anarob antibiotic drip after it was found to contain harmful levels of bacterial toxins.
Anarob Infusion is an intravenous antibiotic drip containing metronidazole, commonly used in hospitals to treat serious bacterial infections in the stomach, skin, lungs, joints, and other parts of the body when oral medicines are not effective.
A medical product alert issued today said Drap’s Central Drugs Laboratory had informed the body that samples of the drug were declared “substandard” due to being out of specification for bacterial endotoxins.
“Use of this contaminated infusion may cause severe adverse reactions such as fever, chills, septic shock and life-threatening complications. Hospitalised and immunocompromised patients are at the greatest risk,” the authority warned.
It said its field force and Provincial Drug Control departments were directed to immediately conduct market surveys to detect and remove the affected batch (H24219) from the market.
It further directed that the regulatory field force of all federating units should also increase surveillance in the market to ensure the effective recall of the defective product.
Drap also ordered that all pharmacists and chemists working at distribution centres and pharmacies should immediately check their stocks and stop supplying the drug, with the remaining stocks being quarantined and returned to the supplier/company.
The authority requested increased vigilance within the supply chains of institutions/pharmacies/healthcare facilities likely to be affected by batches of the drug.
It instructed that any adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of the drug be reported to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC), using the Adverse Event Reporting Form or the following link.
“Consumers should stop using products bearing the affected batch number and shall contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking or using this drug product, and report the incident to Drap/ National Pharmacovigilance Centre,” the alert concluded.
Last year in March, Drap directed a pharmaceutical company to recall a syrup, which is given to children to treat fever, from the market and advised health professionals not to prescribe it.
In January 2024, Drap directed pharmaceutical companies to recall nine contaminated syrups, according to its chief executive officer.</p><small>2025-09-09 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622780-pml-ns-rana-sanaullah-wins-senate-by-election-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N's Rana Sanaullah wins Senate by-election in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Central District Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com that the factory building that originally caught fire collapsed, and four firemen were injured as a result.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan, in a statement, said, “Besides the four firefighters, a cameraman of a private TV channel was also injured due to the building collapse.”
New Karachi Industrial Area Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Qureshi told Dawn.com that the fire erupted at around 6:30am and factory building collapsed around noon.
According to SSP Siddiqi, the presence of diesel drums compounded the fire, which spread rapidly, engulfing two more industrial units in its vicinity.
 


The injured firefighters were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while further checks were being carried out at the Civil Hospital Karachi and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for any additional casualties.
The police officer identified the four injured persons as 50-year-old Ismail, 35-year-old Owais, 30-year-old Buland, and Aslam, also aged 30 years. “They are in a stable condition,” he added.
SSP Siddiqi and the central district commissioner supervised the firefighting operation.
According to an update shared by SHO Qureshi around 3.15pm, the fire was brought under control by then but the cooling work still ongoing.
Detailing the rescue operation, Haseeb said the firemen “immediately” responded after receiving information about the fire. A fire and rescue team, one ambulance and five fire tenders reached the spot and assisted in controlling the fire.
The Rescue 1122 claimed that the immediate response helped them in controlling the blaze, but the building collapsed due to the impact of the fire.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
 
 

According to city planners and engineers, 70 per cent of residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Karachi lacked an adequate fire safety system. Citing official data of the city’s fire department, Fire Protection Association President Kunwar Waseem said the city witnessed nearly 3,000 such incidents in 2024.
In late August, at least six people died in a fire that broke out after a massive explosion inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex.
Earlier that month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories.</p><small>2025-09-09 11:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/091321058e29b4b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940726/pakistani-authorities-allegedly-spying-on-millions-through-mass-surveillance-systems-amnesty-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani authorities allegedly spying on millions through mass surveillance systems: Amnesty report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani authorities have allegedly been surveilling over four million of its citizens, via tools of mass surveillance, acquired from private foreign companies, further clamping down on the country’s cyber landscape, an Amnesty International report revealed on Tuesday.
The report, titled “Shadows of Control: Censorship and Mass Surveillance in Pakistan“ alleged that “Pakistani authorities have continued to unlawfully surveil the country’s citizens, including regular citizens, journalists, as well as prominent politicians.”
The rights watchdog stated that Pakistani authorities allegedly “use the Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS) to surveil a significant portion of the population’s digital activity through Pakistani telecommunications providers.”
The number of phones under surveillance could be higher as all four major mobile operators have been ordered to connect to LIMS, Amnesty technologist Jurre van Berge told Reuters.
The report, citing the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), said that telecommunications providers were “under an obligation to ensure that up to two per cent of their entire consumer base can be surveilled.“
Authorities also employ a firewall known as WMS 2.0 that inspects internet traffic and can block two million active sessions at a time, Amnesty alleged, further enhancing the system of surveillance.
LIMS is a product sold by a German company called Ultimaco, which “allows for the classification of internet traffic and mobile communications such as text messaging and voice and [stores] this data for authorities to go through”.
The technology has been in use in Pakistan since 2007.
 


According to its findings, “Utimaco’s LIMS allows the authorities to sift through the telecommunications provider subscriber data”.
Using the LIMS system, the authorities only need a person’s phone number, the report said.
The report went on to explain that this data is then “made accessible through a Monitoring Centre Next Generation (McNG)”.
According to the report, “McNG is a product by Datafusion, formerly Trovicor, which allows authorities to sift through the material collected by LIMS.” Using the McNG system, “operators can see [who has] been calling whom, when this happened, what websites were browsed, if someone might’ve used WhatsApp or a VPN and their location”.
The report attributed the unchecked deployment of mass surveillance to a lack of technical and legal safeguards.
Amnesty recalled that the workings of the LIMS system came to light in the case of Bushra Bibi vs Federation of Pakistan, filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), after “a series of prominent cases of interception and leaking of audio recordings of calls between politicians and public figures became public” between 2022 and 2023.
 
 

The case was filed to “investigate these recordings and the legality of interception of telecoms”.
As a result, it was disclosed that the PTA had issued directions to telecom licensees to “finance, import and install LIMS at a designated place for the use of designated agencies“, the report said.
In its assessment, the amnesty added that the use of technology to curb freedom and the right to privacy contributes to a “chilling effect and a shrinking of civic space in the country”.
Calling for safeguards to protect citizens’ data, the rights body pointed out that Pakistan’s current data systems were highly centralised, leaving citizens vulnerable to such surveillance.
It cautioned that the “scope of this surveillance and its interconnectedness is expected to increase with the enactment of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025”.
The Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025 aims to create a digital identity for citizens, to centralise social, economic, and governance data.
Internet censorship, shutdowns
According to the report, the mass surveillance in Pakistan works in conjunction with frequent internet censorship, made possible via the use of the Web Monitoring System (WMS). “Internet censorship involves blocking specific content on the internet, slowing down and controlling internet speeds, or shutting down the internet altogether,” it said.
The watchdog noted that the first iteration of the WMS was installed in Pakistan in 2018 by a company called Sandvine; however, according to Amnesty’s investigation, the previous WMS was replaced by a more advanced system produced by a Chinese company, Geedge Networks.
Amnesty went on to say that the new technology was a commercialised version of China’s “Great Firewall”, which is a censorship tool used by the Chinese government.
 
 

The installation of the system was ensured with the help of various foreign companies, including US-based Niagara Networks, French company Thales, and Chinese company New H3C Technologies, it said.
Furthermore, the report mentioned that the PTA had “blocked more than 1.4 million URLs since the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was passed in 2016”.
The rights watchdog noted that the process of blocking and removing content has always been “marked by opacity and arbitrariness”.
It said that the users were “rarely provided any notice by the PTA” before the blocking of content, and became aware of it only when they were unable to access the said content.
Regarding internet shutdowns, Amnesty noted that “the pattern of shutting down mobile and internet services in the name of maintaining law and order has become a regular occurrence”.
Citing a report by the ‘Keep it On’ coalition, Amnesty said that between 2016 and 2024, Pakistan experienced at least 77 internet shutdown incidents, with 24 of these in 2024 alone.
These included selective blocking of specific sites or content, and “bandwidth throttling” especially in the time leading up to the 2024 general elections, as well as during virtual rallies held by the PTI.
Citing data from the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), Amnesty showcased that “just before the general election on 8 February 2024, OONI measurements confirm that several websites were blocked, including the opposition PTI party website and the PTI candidates’ website, as well as Fact Focus, an investigative news outlet”.
 


Amnesty said that “this shows that the new firewall is being used effectively by Pakistani telecommunications providers to actively block crucial communication channels.”
Recalling the recent internet shutdown in Balochistan and similar incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Amnesty highlighted that “these shutdowns are often used to disrupt protests and political rallies”.
As per Amnesty’s assessment, the four companies named in the report — Geedge Networks, Utimaco, Datafusion and Niagara Networks — allegedly “contributed to human rights abuse in Pakistan by facilitating mass surveillance”.
“Mass surveillance and unlawful censorship by the Pakistani authorities represent systemic abuses of fundamental human rights,” the rights body said.
Amnesty called for “urgent action” to prevent any further harm, stressing that the “unchecked digital repression” will limit space for democracy.

Faraz Bilal Sidiqqui, the spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Haripur, told Dawn.com that the accident took place when a trailer en route to Rawalpindi collided with a car near Maqsood interchange on the motorway.
“As a result, five members of a family, including three men and two women, were killed,” he said.
Sidiqqui added that rescue personnel shifted the dead bodies to a type-D hospital in Haripur district’s Havelian.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
In August, a policeman deployed on the security of a Chinese delegation had died while six others, including a deputy superintendent of police, were injured when a mobile van had overturned near Chechiyan interchange of the Hazara Motorway.
The incident, according to police, had occurred when the front tyre of the escort van burst and the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing the vehicle to overturn.
In May, two people were killed and one was injured when a car had veered off a bridge on the Hazara Motorway plunged into the dried bed of a watercourse. Local police said that speeding caused the fatal accident.</p><small>2025-09-09 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0914314027b329f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940735/apakistan-kazakhstan-sign-action-plan-of-cooperation-to-boost-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Kazakhstan sign Action Plan of Cooperation to further boost ties</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Kazakhstan on Tuesday signed the Action Plan of Cooperation to boost bilateral ties, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries. According to Kazakh envoy Yerzhan Kistafin, bilateral trade was growing and surged to $239 million.
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar held a “tête-à-tête” with his Kazakh counterpart Murat Nurtleu, the FO said in a post on X.
They held a meeting in Islamabad where both sides “reaffirmed their resolve to deepen their political and economic ties”, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
“The two sides also vowed to enhance regional connectivity and maintain close coordination ahead of the forthcoming [Kazakhstan’s] presidential visit in November this year,” it added.
 






In another post, the FO noted that the delegations held high-level talks on the “full spectrum of Pakistan- Kazakhstan cooperation”, which were co-chaired by Dar and Nurtleu.
“Discussions focused on boosting trade and investment, agriculture, IT, education, culture, tourism, security and logistics connectivity,” it said, adding that the roadmap for Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s visit was finalised.
Following the talks, “the two DPM/FMs also signed the Action Plan of Cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan.”
 






During the ongoing two-day official visit, Kazakhstan’s FM was accompanied by a high-level 13-member delegation. Nurtleu was also expected to call on President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In April, Pakistan and Kazakhstan agreed to sign a transit trade accord for the movement of goods through three Pakistani ports — Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar — and to engage other regional landlocked nations for opening multiple trade corridors.
Both sides also agreed to promote tourism by sharing lists of certified tour operators and launching joint promotional activities. In August last year, Ambassador Kistafin highlighted the opportunity of a direct flight from Kazakhstan to Skardu.</p><small>2025-09-09 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bf446bccbbe.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940589/gangs-in-sindhs-riverine-area-mulling-surrender-due-to-impending-flood' target='_blank'><strong>Gangs in Sindh’s riverine area mulling surrender due to impending flood</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Amid an ongoing operation against gangs operating in riverine areas, more than 260 dacoits have contacted police and expressed their willingness to surrender along with their weapons, on the condition that the government facilitates their reintegration into society, it emerged on Monday.
Well-placed sources told Dawn that the present flood situation in the riverine areas was one of the key factors behind the dacoits’ willingness to surrender.
They said that the development was discussed during the inaugural meeting of the Katcha Areas Monitoring Committee (KAMC), which reviewed the ongoing anti-bandit operations, the security situation and the provincial government’s broader strategy.
The sources said that the Larkana police have informed their high-ups that more than 260 dacoits in the Katcha area have expressed their willingness to surrender in view of the impending flood threat.

Over 260 dacoits contacted Larkana police, sought reintegration support from govt, meeting told

 
 

Talking to Dawn, Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar, who chaired the KAMC meeting, said that the surrender process would be handled strictly according to the law. “The law is already there empowering the government to deal with those who are willing to surrender,” he added.
He also said that the Sindh government was “extremely” sincere and determined to eliminate the bandits in the Katcha area. “However, any bandit or group of bandits surrendering peacefully and presenting themselves before the law will strictly be subject to rules and regulations, as the law is clear on matters of surrender,” he added.
Plan underway to ensure dacoits’ surrender
Informed sources said that the authorities were working on a plan to provide an exit route for those willing to surrender, while hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like murder and kidnapping for ransom may face strict action.
They said that a plan was also under deliberation to encourage dacoits and their abettors in the riverine areas to surrender, provided they give up their sophisticated weapons unconditionally.
A report on this development has been submitted to the provincial government, which is currently examining the legal framework for handling hardened criminals in the Katcha area involved in serious offences like murder and kidnapping for ransom, said the sources.
They said that the provincial government was exploring possible legal provisions that could offer a way out for these outlaws if they choose to surrender.
They also said that some law enforcement agencies were considering offering a general amnesty to dacoits who agree to surrender. However, the provincial government was reportedly hesitant to extend leniency to hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like multiple murders and kidnapping for ransom.
Police seek equipment, weapons to combat bandits
During the KAMC meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Zubair Nazir Sheikh provided a briefing on the law and order situation and ongoing operations in the Katcha areas. He emphasised the urgent requirement for modern equipment, advanced weapons, and secure vehicles to effectively combat the bandits.
Additionally, he highlighted the need to enhance facilities at existing checkpoints in the riverine areas and outlined plans to equip police with cutting-edge technology and professional training to boost their capabilities.
The home minister directed that detailed and practical recommendations for providing necessary resources to the police be submitted promptly.
 
 

He stated that after the construction of bridges at Dadu, Moro, Larkana and Khairpur, crimes had decreased, but it is vital to accelerate work on the Ghotki and Kashmore bridge projects so they are completed at the earliest. The construction of these bridges on this route will also significantly reduce crime.
Mr Lanjar also asked the schools & education and health departments about the number of schools, educational institutions, hospitals, and dispensaries in the Katcha areas.
He said the purpose of this inquiry was to establish temporary campuses during operations to ensure that the provision of education and health facilities does not get interrupted.
He acknowledged that delays in the past had prevented the operation from being completed but emphasised that the anti-bandit operation must be brought to a successful conclusion under all circumstances.
He appealed to all stakeholders to demonstrate collective determination and stand as strong partners.
The meeting was attended, among others, by the IGP Sindh, senior members Board of Revenue, education and law secretaries, representatives of the health and forest departments, Additional IG of CTD and Special Branch, and representatives of Sindh Rangers and other security agencies.

However, flood victims have alleged discriminatory behaviour in relief efforts. They claim that Ganda Singh Talwar post has received undue attention due to visits by ministers and prominent political figures, while other severely affected areas like Kanganpur, Mandi Usmanwala, and Balloki, where relief camps were officially set up are being neglected.
During a provincial assembly session on Saturday, PML-N MPA Ahsan Raza openly criticised his own government for the allegedly biased distribution of aid. He accused the administration of favouritism in distributing food and fodder, particularly at politically significant points.
Flood victims across multiple areas continue to face severe hardships due to a shortage of boats. This shortage has not only hampered evacuation efforts but also delayed the supply of essential food, fodder, and medicines. Welfare organisations and stranded villagers seeking transport have reported waiting for hours, as boats were allegedly diverted for VIP movement and political visits.

DC denies charges of discrimination in distribution

An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, lamented the scene at Ganda Singh Talwar, describing it as a recreational park for some people while it was a ray of hope for the stranded people waiting for food, fodder and medicines.At Kothi Fateh Muhammad, downstream from Sutlej, the water level has reached 15 feet, damaging dozens of villages.
The Ravi at Head Baloki is also experiencing a high flood, with 125,000 cusecs of water discharge, slightly reduced from a peak of 148,000 cusecs over the past 24 hours.
At Ganda Singh Headworks, the flood situation remains critical, with a discharge of 319,295 cusecs recorded on Monday. The region has been grappling with this emergency for nearly a week. Over 70 villages have been submerged and thousands of acres of crops have been destroyed.
 
 

Local residents reported that only five boats were available in the Mandi Usmanwala area on Monday. One boat broke down, and the remaining four were preoccupied with searching for the body of a youth who drowned while filming a TikTok video. As a result, no aid official or private could reach around a dozen villages due to the unavailability of boats.
In Kanganpur and Kothi Fateh Muhammad, a similar shortage persists. In case of medical emergencies, residents of villages like Doana, Shahbazkay, Rukanpura, Muradkay, Khanay Peer, and Sher Kot reportedly have to wait several hours for a boat.
In Phoolnagar’s Kamogil village, the revenue department declined to repair a broken embankment, citing the lack of machinery. Villagers later restored the dyke through self-help efforts.
Private welfare organisations remain active in delivering aid to remote villages, including Kamogil, Nathay Jageer, Jaja Kalan, Chatri, Wazirpur, Thama Kamyana, and Dalu Multani. Residents say official relief from the district or provincial government in these areas is rare.
Tensions also arose earlier when the district administration reportedly dismantled a relief camp run by a political party merely because it had banners displaying the party leader’s picture even though it was operating during a medium flood phase.
Speaking to Dawn, Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said the administration had deployed 85 boats across the district.He said the boats had been distributed as per the population proportion so that all could be helped.He denied allegations of discrimination and claimed that on Monday alone, 2,000 food boxes and ration bags were delivered.
The DC added that 250,000 people from 72 villages and hamlets have been displaced by the floods. So far, 95,000 people have been transported to safer areas, while 113,000 remain stranded in submerged zones. He emphasised that food and fodder are being provided without bias, in accordance with the vision of the Punjab chief minister.

The couple, identified as Shahroz Muhammad Ali and Kanwal, were arrested on Sunday by the Ferozabad police, which registered a case against them under Sections 328-A (cruelty to a child) and 337-A (i) (shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 14-(1) of the Sindh Prohibition of Employment of Children Act, 2017.
The said section of the child law states: “Whoever employs any child shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with a fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.”
On Monday, the investigating officer produced the couple before Judicial Magistrate (East) Hameedullah and sought their physical remand for further interrogation.
Meanwhile, the defence counsel requested the court to grant them bail, arguing that the offences mentioned in the FIR were bailable.
 
 

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to the couple against a surety bond of Rs30,000 each along with a personal bond. Subsequently, the couple was released and their handcuffs were removed after the surety amount was submitted before the court.
Speaking to Dawn, Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that a 13-year-old girl from Ferozabad police station was brought to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on Sunday night with “multiple burn marks in different stages of healing, all over the body.” She was “stable” but referred for treatment, the police surgeon added.
According to the FIR, complainant Aasiya informed the police that around three months ago, she had sent her 13 to 14-year-old daughter to work as a house help at the residence of Shahroz and his wife Kanwal in PECHS Block 2, where the girl used to stay day and night.
However, on Aug 31, Kanwal called the complainant and told her that her daughter was unwell and asked her to take the girl back.
When Aasiya reached the flat, the girl told her that she had been burnt with an electric iron on different parts of her body and showed the marks.
The girl further stated to her mother that two days earlier, on Aug 29, while she was ironing Kanwal’s clothes, her dupatta had burnt. In reaction, Kanwal allegedly burnt her with the same iron, despite the girl begging her for forgiveness. She added that her husband had also physically assaulted her.

A press release stated that the CHRI, the Commonwealth Journalists Association (CJA) and the Commonwealth Lawyers Association (CLA) called on member states to urgently repeal “laws that criminalise legitimate public speech” and take decisive action to protect media workers and watchdogs from violence and intimidation.
“The report Who Controls the Narrative? Legal Restrictions on Freedom of Expression in the Commonwealth finds that criminal provisions for speech offences, including defamation and sedition, as well as violations of national security laws, are arbitrarily applied to intimidate and silence journalists, human rights defenders, and government critics,” the press release read.
“A key objective, the authors argue, must be to decriminalise defamation laws in 41 Commonwealth countries — many of which permit long prison sentences.”
 






According to the press release, the report is based on analyses of national legal frameworks and draws on testimonies from over 30 senior journalists and 35 lawyers across Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific regions.
The report concludes that the Commonwealth’s past inaction has “contributed to the serious and persistent challenges to the protection of freedom of expression and the rule of law in some member countries”.
The report urges the secretariat and member states to act resolutely, together with non-governmental organisations, to ensure observance of the 11-point Commonwealth Principles on Freedom of Expression and the Role of the Media in Good Governance adopted by Heads of Government in Samoa.
 
 

“These media principles call on governments to create a safe and enabling environment for media workers, and to review and consider amending unduly restrictive domestic laws that inhibit free speech both online and offline,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the report found that 213 journalists were killed in 19 Commonwealth countries between 2006 and 2023, and in 96 per cent of cases, the perpetrators were not brought to justice, according to Unesco figures.
It also found that 41 Commonwealth countries maintain criminal penalties for defamation; 48 retain laws related to sedition; and 37 have legislation regarding blasphemy, the press release stated.
“The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) is urged to fulfil its mandate to address systematic constraints on civil society and the media,” the press release read. “The CMAG should be reformed and supported by a Commonwealth Envoy on Freedom of Expression.”
The CHRI, CJA and CLA urged member states to develop action plans with state and non-state actors to accelerate the repeal of criminal legislation for speech and anti-state offences in line with international best practice.
“Collaborate with civil society and international human rights organisations, including UNESCO, to monitor and support the implementation of the Commonwealth Media Principles,” the three bodies urged, requesting that members prioritise the protection of civil and political rights.
As part of its recommendations, the report urged the following:

“Too many Commonwealth countries continue to enforce colonial-era laws that criminalise speech and silence dissent, in clear violation of their international obligations,“ Sneh Aurora, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative director, was quoted as saying.
“The media principles adopted by [the] heads of government in Samoa provide a timely opportunity for member states to take concrete steps — through law reform and institutional safeguards — to protect freedom of expression and align national laws with international human rights standards.”
William Horsley of the CJA said: “The almost complete failure of Commonwealth countries to prosecute and punish those responsible for the killings of over 200 journalists in 20 years is shameful.
“This culture of impunity must be swept away. A genuine Commonwealth engagement to protect the truth-tellers from threats and reprisals would give the organisation a vital new sense of purpose at a time when the concept of truth is under fierce attack.”</p><small>2025-09-09 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bf74e0abc4a.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940626/flour-roti-prices-rise' target='_blank'><strong>Flour, roti prices rise</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Following a surge in sugar prices, consumers are now facing higher costs for flour and roti across various parts of Pakistan as wheat and flour prices continue to rise.
In Karachi, tandoor operators have raised the price of various roti varieties by an average of Rs2 per piece, which will mainly impact low- and middle-income groups, particularly daily wage earners and the labour class, who typically rely on eating their meals at local eateries.
The sharp rise in prices is evident in branded flour, with some millers raising the cost of a five-kilogram bag of fine flour to Rs700, up from Rs500 on Aug 1 and Rs600 on Sept 1, despite the arrival of the new wheat crop earlier this year. Retailers report that large-scale traders are likely profiting from the rise in prices, taking advantage of the higher demand for old flour stocks.
Some market analysts believe the ongoing wheat crisis is unrelated to the recent floods in Punjab and other regions, as the new wheat crop was harvested in March/April. However, hoarders, stockists, and investors are reportedly holding substantial wheat stocks, waiting for further price hikes driven by supply and demand dynamics.
Salman Mian Araieen, a member of the All Sindh Sheermal Tandoor Roti Association, stated that tandoor operators who were previously selling naan at Rs22 and Rs23 per piece (weighing 180 grams) have now raised prices to Rs25. Additionally, the price of chapati has increased by Rs2 per piece, reaching Rs14-15, up from Rs11-12. Some tandoor owners have refrained from passing on the full impact of rising flour prices, waiting for a potential reversal in flour rates.
According to Araieen, the price of 50 kg of fine atta has risen by Rs1,900 in just a month, now costing Rs5,700 per bag, up from Rs3,800. Despite the rise in flour costs, the prices of sheermal and taftan have remained unchanged, even as sugar prices climbed to Rs200 per kg from Rs180, and the cost of a 16kg tin of ghee surged to Rs7,900 from Rs6,500 in recent months. Currently, sheermal and taftan are priced at Rs70-90 per piece, depending on weight and quality. If flour prices continue to rise, an additional Rs10 per piece may be added to these items.
Some tandoor owners are reportedly considering discontinuing the sale of Rs20 naan (weighing 140-145 grams), as the price no longer covers their costs. Araieen noted that the price of a 40kg wheat bag, which has now reached Rs3,943 (Rs9,857 per 100kg), is the highest recorded in 72 weeks, last seen in April 2024.

• Floodwaters not receding as ‘backwater effect’ prevents Chenab from flowing into Indus; high-level alert for Sutlej after advisory from India
• PM Shehbaz forms committee to assess flood damage; official says over 4m people affected by floods
LAHORE: The southern districts of Punjab, particularly Multan, are at risk of severe flooding due to the swollen Chenab River, with the authorities preparing for a breach at the Sher Shah dyke to save the urban centres from inundation.
Although no decision had been taken to breach the Shershah bund at the time of going to press, officials were clear that the dyke would have to be breached if the water level crossed the critical threshold of 393.5 feet. As of Monday night, the water level was steady at 393 feet.
Officials said the flood would approach Multan in the next 48 hours, which would make the situation very critical for the city, which is already at risk of flooding.
Against this backdrop, it seemed that the decision to breach the embankment had already been made anticipating a massive surge heading towards Multan from Trimmu Headworks.
Multan MNA and ex-PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, in a Facebook post, asked people living in settlements along the embankment to relocate immediately. The PPP leader said water would be diverted towards Sher Shah, Gagra Kachhor, Mouza Hamar and other adjacent areas to break the flood force and avoid further damage.
Meanwhile, floodwaters that had entered Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday submerged more localities in the district, including Alipur tehsil. Due to a backwater effect that was preventing the Chenab from falling into the Indus, the water had started flowing upstream of Panjnad.
The water first entered Panjnad Headworks’ downstream settlements Makhan Bela, Azmatpur, Bait Mullanwali, Bait Nabi Shah, Paka Naich, Bazwala, Lati Marri, Bait Burraha, Kundrala, and Bait Channa, and later flooded upstream areas of Ghalwan-I and Dammar Wala Janobi. The authorities relocated thousands of people to save them from flooding.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a committee led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal for the completion of the damage and need assessment report of the ongoing floods within two weeks.
Flood threat
Addressing a press conference in Multan, Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Jalalpur Pirwala was still facing the flood threat. He said that the first flood was moving out slowly and the water was not receding, while another surge from Head Trimmu was on its way towards Multan.
He said that the pressure would increase on Head Muhammadwala and the Sher Shah dyke in the next 24 hours. He said 63 people lost their lives and rescue boats had made 27,000 trips in Multan, adding that 4300 villages in 26 districts were affected due to the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab floods.
 
 

Multan Commissioner Aamir Kareem Khan said 4,000 people were evacuated and shifted to safer places in Jalalpur Pirwala.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said 4.199 million people from 4,300 villages were affected due to the flooding in the eastern rivers. He said that 2.147 million people, who were trapped in the floods, had been relocated to safer locations and 412 relief and 492 medical camps were established in the flood-affected districts.
The commissioner further shared the water situation of different dams, including Mangla Dam was 88 per cent full while Tarbela Dam was 100pc full. According to the commissioner, India’s Bhakra Dam on the River Sutlej was 90pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while Thein Dam was 97pc full.
Earlier, the PDMA released a high-level flood alert for the Sutlej River, following an official advisory from the Indian High Commission regarding the rising water flow.
According to the alert, the river was experiencing a high flood level at the Harike and Ferozepur downstream points in India, indicating that water levels were expected to rise further within Pakistan.
Ganda Singh Wala Headworks on the Sutlej would continue to be in an “exceptionally high” flood. Besides riverine floods, Punjab’s urban centres also faced urban flooding.
Lahore recorded a heavy rainfall in several of its areas, with some localities, including Jail Road, receiving more than 100mm of rain on Monday. Meanwhile, torrential downpour in Faisalabad broke a 30-year record for the city.
Flowing backwards
As of Monday night, the floodwaters were not receding as the Indus River was pushing back the water from the Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi rivers. Due to this backwater effect, the operational capacity of the Panjnad Headworks had also reduced, according to a PDMA official.
Despite a steady flow of over 524,000 cusecs at Panjnad, the water was flowing upstream. Panjnad had recorded a flow of 609,664 cusecs till 12:30am and the water receded to 524,762 cusecs by 3:30 pm.
Just like the Indus, the Chenab is pushing back Ravi waters, a phenomenon that has previously led to a perilous rise in pressure at the Sidhnai Barrage on the Ravi River.
For the past few days, flows had remained dangerously steady at over 135,000 cusecs despite falling inflows from the upstream Balloki. To avert a catastrophic breach at Sidhnai, the government had to make a breach at the Mai Sufara embankment to save the barrage.
In a second major emergency operation, a controlled breach was made on the Sutlej River near Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday night to divert water towards the Vehari district.
RYK capsize
Three people were killed while at least 8-10 people, mostly children, were missing after a boat capsized in the Chenab floodwater in the Noorwala area of tehsil Liaqatpur.
Reports said that a boat carrying almost 28 people capsized in Mouza Noorwala located in the riverbed area of the Chenab.

• Audit had flagged over Rs375tr in financial irregularities, loss of public money, ineffective public investments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) on Monday rejected media reports alleging errors and miscalculations in its audit reports released last month, which had highlighted more than Rs375 trillion in financial irregularities, loss of public money and lack of intended impact of public investments.
“AGP rejects allegations of errors in audit reports,” said a statement issued by the Department of the Auditor General of Pakistan (DAGP). It added that the office “strongly rejected recent media reports alleging miscalculations in the federal audit reports, terming them entirely unfounded and misleading.”
The DAGP also denied that the reports had been released bypassing the constitutional process, which requires their submission to the president and then laying before parliament.
According to the statement, the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements for the fiscal year 2023-24 were duly submitted to the president and routed through the prime minister, strictly in line with constitutional provisions and the Rules of Business 1973. “The president approved the submission, and the reports were subsequently transmitted to both houses of parliament,” it said.
The DAGP explained that as the supreme audit institution of the country, it functions under a constitutional mandate laid down in Articles 168 to 171 of the Constitution.
Article 171 states: “The reports of the Auditor General relating to the accounts of the Federation shall be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before both Houses of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament). The reports relating to the accounts of a Province shall be submitted to the Governor of the Province, who shall cause them to be laid before the Provincial Assembly.”
The statement further said that the app­r­oval of the reports from the president was duly communicated through the President’s Secretariat on April 12, 2025. Following this, the required number of federal audit reports were printed for laying before both houses of parliament.
On the AGP’s request, the motions were included in the National Assembly’s Orders of the Day issued on August 13, 2025. However, the National Assembly Secretariat, through its deputy secretary (legislation), informed the same day that the assembly session had been prorogued. As a result, the motion for laying the reports could not be included in the Orders of the Day.
The secretariat further asked that the reports be collected from the legislation branch, with due observance of confidentiality until they are formally laid before the house. “It is further clarified that the audit reports transmitted to the Senate remain in the custody of the Senate Secretariat,” it added.
Based on this record, the DAGP said: “The news currently circulating in different sections of print media alleging miscalculations in the audit reports and claiming that these reports were returned to the Department of the Auditor-General of Pakistan by the National Assembly Secretariat are entirely unfounded and misleading.”
It stressed that the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements were sent to the NA Secretariat after the president’s approval on the prime minister’s advice to lay them before both houses of parliament.
Defending the integrity of its audit findings, the AGP asserted that the reports were prepared after proper quality assurance and “did not contain any errors”. It explained that the figures cited in the media came only from the executive summary of the consolidated federal audit report for 2024-25, which is prepared as a reference document to help stakeholders access and review sector-wise findings.

Speaking at a news conference, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to China, the two sides had agreed to constitute a consortium of financiers, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China and Pakistan, for the 1,700-km Karachi-Peshawar railway line.
He said China had assured financing not only for ML-1 but also for the Karakoram Highway. Negotiations with multiple financiers would be concluded within a month. He added that ML-1 and the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway would already have been completed, had it not been for the 2018 political change, alleging that the subsequent PTI government “destroyed the process”.
The minister said Pakistan and China had agreed to develop and implement a four-year action plan to build, between 2025 and 2029, a “China-Pakistan community with a shared future” with stronger political trust, closer trade ties, deeper security cooperation and stronger people-to-people links. Agriculture modernisation and industrial development would be prioritised under CPEC’s second phase, with space for third-party participation.

Minister says Beijing also assured funding for Karakoram Highway

The next meeting of the Joint Cooperation Council (JCC) of CPEC will be held on Sept 26 in Beijing. Both sides also agreed to advance industrial park development in line with local needs, support enterprise investment in special economic zones (SEZs) — particularly in Karachi and Islamabad — and offer preferential policies and a supportive business environment.
Mr Iqbal said the action plan was a “solid development” of leadership-level meetings aimed at deepening strategic cooperation and advancing the shared vision of an even closer partnership in the new era between two “time-tested, friendly countries.”
The two sides agreed to make full use of the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation to accelerate industrialisation, support exports and encourage Chinese firms to invest in Pakistan, including in the mining sector and building mining industrial parks.
They also agreed to promote cooperation in crop cultivation, animal husbandry, epidemic control for plants and animals, aquaculture, agro-processing, agricultural mechanisation and capacity building in seed technology and drip irrigation.
The plan includes aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Pakistan’s 5Es Framework, implementing both large-scale landmark projects and “small and beautiful” livelihood projects, while ensuring both high-quality development and robust security.

QUETTA: Opposition leaders vowed to continue holding protests across Baloc­histan after police arrested 260 people on Monday for alleged violent demo­n­s­trations and violation of Section 144.
The arrests came as Quetta and other parts of the province were brought to a virtual standstill as a result of a strike — announced by opposition parties to protest a recent suicide bombing, which claimed over a dozen lives.
Life across the province was also disrupted and due to road blocks, Balochistan remained cut off from the rest of the country, barring rail and aerial routes.
Clashes were also reported between protesters and the police. A senior police official was also taken to hospital with bullet injuries, officials said.
Workers and supporters of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan alliance blocked all national highways at different entry points, putting up barricades and big boulders in the morning to block all types of traffic. Transporters’ associations had already announced support for their protest.
Likewise, trade activities between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were suspended due to the strike. Not a single truck or other vehicle crossed into the border towns of Chaman and Taftan due to the blockade on highways linking Balochistan with Afghanistan and Iran.
The airport and rail services, however, remained operational under the watchful eye of security personnel.
Besides roads and trade, businesses also remained shut and the supporters of the opposition parties patrolled the business hubs of the provincial capital, seemingly to enforce the strike.
Clashes erupted in the areas of Sariab, Airport Road, Pashtunabad, Nawa Killi, and Jinnah Road when police attempted to remove blockades from main roads.
Police removed the hurdles and did not allow the alliance workers to block intra-city roads.
The protesters, however, managed to block the Western and Eastern bypasses for a brief period, but police dispersed them by firing tear gas.
On Airport Road too, police fired in the air to disperse protesters who were blocking the road, while clashes were also reported from Sariab Road.
SSP Mohammad Baloch told Dawn that those detained had been sent to the district jail.
PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, ex-MNA Abdul Qahar Wadan, BNP-Mengal leader Mir Naseer Ahmed Shahwani and others were also arrested by the police.
Private educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remained closed due to the protest.
However, government-run educational institutions and offices remained open, but very few employees could reach the secretariat and other offices due to low traffic.
60 arrested across province
In other parts of the province, over 60 people were arrested for violating Section 144, blocking the highways, and clashing with the security forces. The wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was also observed in Loralai, Zhob, Sibi. Nasirabad, Khuzdar, Kalat, Harnai, Mastung, Hub Bela, Kharan, Noshki, Qila Saifullah, Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, Dera Murad Jamali and other towns and cities. “Around 60 people were arrested in these towns,” said officials.
In KP, the opposition parties, as well as the ruling PTI, also organised demonstrations across the province.
The strike call was given by PkMAP, BNP, the PTI, the ANP, the National Party, and the MWM at a joint presser last week to protest the Sept 2 suicide bombing.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the attack as they had left just a few minutes before.
Press conference
Addressing the media at the Quetta Press Club on Monday evening, PkMAP’s Lala Abdul Rauf, BNP’s Sajid Tareen Advocate, ANP’s Asghar Achakzai, National Party’s Aslam Baloch, Jamaat-e-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar, and PTI’s Dawood Shah Achakzai condemned what they called the government’s attempts to sabotage their strike. They decried baton charge, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests of peaceful protesters and announced a plan to hold more protest rallies.
The leaders announced that protests will be held on Sept 11 in front of press clubs across Balochistan, while a meeting of senior leaders has been scheduled for Sept 13 to finalise the alliance’s future course of action. They warned that if political workers and leaders detained across the province were not released, a tougher line of action would be announced at the Sept 13 meeting.
Former governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Shafqaat Langove, Jameel Mashwani, Abdul Hameed Mansoori, Mir Ghulam Nabi Marri, Kabir Afghan, and Ismatullah were also present at the press conference.
Behram Baloch, Ali Jan Mangi, and Abdul Wahid Shahwani also contributed

Floods have displaced two million people, submerged 2,000 villages, and led to the relocation of 760,000 residents and 516,000 heads of cattle from the affected areas.
The satellite imagery of 24 Punjab districts in the command areas of the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers shows that arou­nd 3,661 square kilometres, or 4.7 per cent of the total area, remained under floodwaters.
The floods have devastated key crops, including rice, sugarcane, corn, vegetables, and cotton. According to the Pakistan Business Forum, approximately 35pc of the cotton crop in central and southern Punjab has been destroyed, with losses reaching as high as 40-50pc in Bahawalnagar, the province’s largest cotton-producing district.

Kissan Board leader claims losses to tune of Rs500bn; over 1.3m acres of farmland submerged

Akhtar Farooq Meo of the Kissan Board Pakistan claimed that farmers sustained losses to the tune of Rs536 billion due to damage to the cotton, rice, sesame, maize, and fodder crops. Mr Meo claimed that many towns were facing shortages of perishable items and the situation could transform into a food crisis.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about damage to the rice crop. The Pakistan Business Forum claimed that 60pc of the rice crop in central and southern Punjab had been destroyed — a claim contested by the exporters.
They said the Basmati crop region, with the exception of Pasrur in Sialkot, remained largely undamaged, adding that the non-Basmati crop, particularly along the Sutlej River, had already been harvested in late July and early August, with only hybrid varieties in some areas sustaining damage.
 
 

However, floods created a severe shortage of fodder, threatening the livestock industry, which was a major contributor to the national GDP.
Meanwhile, experts feared a sharp rise in domestic grain prices that could make Pakistani rice uncompetitive on the global market. Similarly, the loss of the cotton crop was also alarming for the textile industry, accounting for over half of Pakistan’s export revenues.
Ihsanul Haq, the chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said the crop was under severe stress.
Major cotton-producing regions in Punjab and Sindh, including Bahawalnagar, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan, were either currently submerged or were bracing for more heavy rainfall. The reduced supply of raw cotton reportedly forced several ginning factories and mills to cease operations. Furthermore, there were early reports of a virus affecting various cotton varieties, which could further reduce per-acre yields.

This is despite the fact that Pakistan officially suffers a severe natural gas and LNG supply glut, compelling the government to seek postponement of more than 170 LNG import cargos and SNGPL forcing local gas producers to shut down their fields or scale down production.
This causes substantial losses, not only to local producers like state-owned OGDCL, listed at the London Stock Exchange, but also erodes the country’s foreign exchange and forces consumers to pay high fixed charges for gas they receive for only a few hours a day.
And yet, while the political leadership remains engaged in firefighting, officials in the Centre and SNGPL —  along with its board of directors, businessmen and other stakeholders concerned with investment facilitation — try to navigate their interests and arguments .

Move aimed at providing ‘level playing field’ for public and private sector gas suppliers

None of the parties involved Dawn contacted — the petroleum division, the SNGPL management and the private entities — chose to speak on the record, rather passed the buck onto other parties.
At the same time, SNGPL has instructed local gas fields which produce cheaper gas, to shut down or reduce output to absorb expensive LNG purchased under binding international contracts. More than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of local gas production has been curtailed.
Unannounced rationing
While producers are forced to limit supply, SNGPL has begun unannounced rationing for residential and commercial customers, providing gas for only two to three hours during breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This follows a government decision to double fixed monthly charges effective July 1, 2025. Consequently, gas consumption of around Rs450 now results in a total bill near Rs 2,500, after fixed charges and taxes are added.
The production cuts have created cash flow problems for local producers like OGDCL, GHPL and others including a few in the private sector, hampering their domestic and international exploration activities.
The country’s largest producer, OGDCL, has publicly deplored the situation.
“The less gas intake by SNGPL from Qadirpur, Nashpa, Chanda, Dhok Hussain, Mela, Bettani, Pirkoh, Togh and Loti fields and TAL owing to SNGPL system constraints and by UPL from Uch fields due to less demand from power purchaser adversely impacted daily net production by 1,148 barrels of crude oil, 76 MMcf of gas and 55 tons of LPG,” the company stated in a report to its board of directors a few months ago.
“During the nine months ending March 31, 2025, OGDCL registered Sales Revenue of Rs 310.907 billion (against Rs348.164 billion of same period of previous year),” the report added. “The Company’s Sales declined primarily due to forced production curtailment accompanied with reduction in average basket price of crude oil.”
With the energy sector’s circular debt exceeding Rs4.6 trillion, the government had allowed local producers to sell some of their gas to third parties to improve their cash flow.
Under such arrangement, some producers like MOL-Pakistan and Petroleum Exploration Limited were allowed by petroleum division to sell their output from Razgir and Zahra North field and some others to third parties.
However, SNGPL resisted an arrangement for the Razgir field, arguing it created “a market distortion”.
The company noted that a Rs791 per unit captive levy, imposed on its industrial customers under IMF instru­ctions, did not apply to third-party suppliers, prompting its customers to switch to cheaper private gas.
Despite this resistance, SNGPL’s board of directors approved the pipeline capacity allocation for the Razgir gas to a third party. While SNGPL management later denied any such approval, records seen by Dawn indicate that at least nine of the 11 board members signed the decision.
In response to the infighting, the Ministry of Law has now ruled the captive power levy applies to all consumers of LNG or local gas, whether supplied by public or private entities.
To resolve the issue, the ministry ruled that while the sale of gas from producers to suppliers is deregulated, the subsequent sale from suppliers to CPPs is not.
The ministry determined that the price has to be determined by Ogra under section 8(6), read with sections 43A and 43B of the Ogra Ordinance for the purpose of collection of levy under the Levy Act of 2025.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), remittance inflows in the first two months of FY26 rose by 7pc, dispelling fears that a reduction in incentives would lead to a decline in remittances.
In August, remittances totalled $3.137 billion, showing a 6.6pc year-on-year increase. However, the monthly inflows saw a slight decline of 2.4pc compared to July, when they were $3.214bn.
While the growth in the first two months of FY26 is positive, it pales in comparison to the remarkable growth witnessed during the same period last fiscal year. Remittances surged by 44pc in 2MFY25 compared to FY24. This extraordinary growth contributed to a record annual total of $38.3bn, which helped maintain exchange rate stability and allowed the SBP to increase its foreign reserves by $7.8bn, reaching $14.5bn.
The government does not expect remittance growth to match the record levels of FY25 but remains hopeful that total inflows will reach around $40bn in FY26.

Inflows rose 6.6pc to $3.13bn in Aug

Despite these expectations, remittances from regions outside the Middle East have shown a decline. Inflows from major destinations like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and GCC countries accounted for about 55pc of total remittance inflows during July-August FY26.
The inflows from Saudi Arabia amounted to $1.56bn, reflecting a modest growth of just 6pc, compared to a 50.7pc increase during the same period last year. Remittances from the UAE grew by 13.8pc, down significantly from the 84.3pc growth recorded in the first two months of FY25, totalling $1.308bn.
 
 

In contrast, inflows from other GCC countries reached $600 million, showing a growth of 5.3pc.
Meanwhile, remittances from the UK and USA showed a decline, with the former down by 0.5pc to $913.7 million, and the latter down by 13.7pc to $537 million. On a positive note, remittances from the European Union (EU) continued to grow, increasing by 18pc to reach $857 million in the first two months of FY26.Financial experts emphasise the need for remittances to remain strong throughout FY26 to maintain a current account surplus and preserve the stability of the exchange rate.
