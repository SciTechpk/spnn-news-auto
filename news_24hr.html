An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
During today’s meeting with Ambassador Jiang, who called on him at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and  aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
 






The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zaradari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.
Last week, China urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
Pakistan to brief UNSC on latest regional developments
A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an immediate session of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.
PM Shehbaz talked to his Malaysian counterpart, while Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to the Malaysian as well as Russian foreign ministers on the matter.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan’s permanent representative to United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.
“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present true facts before the international community,” the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region as well as India’s aggressive steps and provocative statements.
It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p><small>2025-05-05 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05115544d3bcf7d.jpg?r=115935' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908587/icj-to-rule-on-sudan-uae-darfur-genocide-case' target='_blank'><strong>ICJ to rule on Sudan-UAE Darfur genocide case</strong></a><br><p>The top United Nations court on Monday will rule in Sudan’s case against the United Arab Emirates, which Khartoum accuses of complicity in genocide due to alleged support for rebel forces.
Sudan has dragged the UAE before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arguing it is supplying weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been battling the Sudanese army since 2023.
The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has dismissed Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands.
Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
The war has triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.
The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.
A world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.
Muawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”
“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.
Responding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.
“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” added Ketait.
Full reparations
In the end, legal experts say Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.
When the UAE signed up for the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes.
“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.
The UAE called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.
Sudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.
Khartoum wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.
The rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.
Judges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and ruled that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.</p><small>2025-05-05 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603204-pti-stands-united-with-army-against-indian-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>PTI stands united with army against Indian aggression</strong></a><br><p>

Officials concerned told her the “outsourcing of more than 11,000 schools has been completed in Punjab, and the enrollment of children has increased manifold.”
She congratulated the minister of education on the enrollment of 1.1 million out-of-school children under the Punjab Education Foundation, says a handout.
The CM directed School Management Councils to provide necessary facilities in schools worth Rs 10 billion within 90 days. She also directed them to build required classrooms in all schools within a year, and said, “Repair 580 most dilapidated and 2,770 precarious school buildings.” She added the construction and repair of schools is among our top priorities.

Over 11,000 schools outsourced, CM told

She set a target of spoken English training of 500,000 children of government schools from English trainers. She directed the relevant authorities to expand the scope of school meal programme to other districts and tehsils keeping in view the number of children suffering from malnutrition there. She also directed them to build Nawaz Sharif School of Eminence for girls and boys in every district, and set a target of upgrade of 1,750 schools in five years.
She was told the upgrade of 250 schools will be done in the next financial year, and 300 Tech-Ed schools will be built in 10 tehsils of Punjab.
MINISTER: Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari strongly condemned Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s decision to boycott the national security briefing, calling it a clear demonstration of their anti-state mentality.
Published in Dawn, May 5th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-05 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0511321282fafec.jpg?r=113219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908493/cotton-prices-witness-surge-courtesy-international-market' target='_blank'><strong>Cotton prices witness surge, courtesy international market</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: After a hiatus of nearly two months, cotton prices in the country have witnessed a significant upswing, accompanied by a renewed purchasing interest from textile mills.
This development has brought relief to cotton ginners are grappling with a prolonged period of low demand and declining prices.
The recent slump in local cotton prices was primarily due to record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). This influx of imported material severely hampered local cotton sales, pushing numerous ginning factories and textile mills towards inactivity due to a severe financial crunch.
However, the tide seems to have turned in the past week. Reports of restored trade relations between China and the United States, coupled with a sharp decline in the US Dollar Index, triggered a substantial surge in cotton prices in international markets. Notably, the New York Cotton Exchange saw its July futures contract jump by a record 2.75 cents per pound in a single day, reaching a multi-month high of 68.41 cents per pound.
The upward trend is expected to continue this week, subsequently impacting domestic prices.
In Pakistan, this global rally has translated into a price increase of approximately Rs500 per maund (40kg), bringing the current cotton price to around Rs17,500 per maund. The renewed buying interest from textile mills has instilled a sense of optimism among cotton ginners.
Meanwhile, despite a consistent failure to achieve cotton cultivation and production targets in recent years, the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) has, once again, set an ambitious and seemingly unattainable production target of 10.18 million bales for the Cotton Year 2025-26. For the first time, however, the FCA has not yet specified the production targets for individual provinces.

Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
While financial markets are betting that US and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.
“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
 
 

“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of 10 per cent alongside higher, sector-specific charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.
Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over 145pc US tariffs, to which it has responded with 125pc levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.
In the meantime, companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux  slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.
Last week’s removal of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.
“We’re going from zero to 145pc, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy.
“I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”
Silver lining
The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.
China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.
Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.
“[This] means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.
However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country — which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple has shifted some output — could end up a genuine winner.
“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.
For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy, which by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.
The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts — something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.

But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example, if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.</p><small>2025-05-05 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603200-modis-war-rhetoric-threatens-mental-wellbeing-of-millions-say-experts' target='_blank'><strong>Modi's war rhetoric threatens mental wellbeing of millions, say experts</strong></a><br><p>

Per the ADB’s latest ‘At a Glance’ report (2023), 17 per cent of the Bank’s total lending and investments globally are directed toward the energy sector, underscoring its significant role in financing power generation and infrastructure — including fossil fuel projects in countries like Pakistan.
The NGO Forum on ADB estimates that the Bank has invested $15.28 billion in 74 energy projects in Pakistan, and its focus on conventional energy over renewables raises concerns. While 50.5pc of the funds were earmarked for modernising the national grid, 17pc support conventional energy expansion (1,330 MW). Meanwhile, renewable projects receive minimal funding. Wind and solar allocations remain unspecified.
Simply put, the ADB’s continued investment in fossil fuels contradicts its sustainability commitments, potentially undermining Pakistan’s energy security and environmental goals. Fossil fuel financing also impacts air quality, with rising levels of particulate matter (PM 2.5), tropospheric ozone and nitrous oxide, disproportionately burdening the country with public health crises, environmental degradation and economic loss.
 
 

Policy and practice
The ADB’s 58th annual meeting presents a critical opportunity to address air pollution — a pressing global crisis that remains conspicuously absent from the meeting’s core agenda. While the health and environmental impacts of unchecked emissions are profoundly damaging, the meeting has yet to commit to concrete measures that reduce the pollution footprint of ADB-funded projects or advance technological solutions.
This year’s meeting includes constructive engagement with civil society organisations (CSOs) and affected communities. However, this dialogue must translate into meaningful action.
Air pollution is affecting every corner of the planet, harming biodiversity, undermining public health, and jeopardising the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal. And while the ADB claims its safeguards mitigate environmental harms, there is a significant gap between policy and practice. The Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) aims for standardised climate accountability, yet international financing institutions (IFIs) such as the ADB fall short in aligning their Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) with these standards.
Where the ETF requires detailed emissions reporting, IFIs like ADB often hide project-level GHG impacts, particularly from coal and gas projects. For instance, ADB-funded coal plants in Pakistan report only aggregated emissions, obscuring local health and ecological damage. Moreover, the Paris Agreement’s focus on CO2 neglects Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane and black carbon, which account for around 45pc of global warming and are common in ADB’s fossil fuel investments.
The ADB, a 69-member multilateral lender, has long positioned itself as a ‘Climate Bank’ and champion of sustainable development through its Environmental and Social Framework. However, the ESF’s non-binding enforcement mechanisms have led to inconsistent adherence to safeguards on displacement, pollution, and indigenous rights — limiting its effectiveness in advancing climate and social justice goals. The absence of Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) standards in Pakistan also restricts the Bank’s space in the integration of stringent emissions standards and technical support. This limitation locks the country into high-pollution development pathways despite the ADB’s role as a multilateral development bank (MDB) with an agenda to foster sustainable growth.
In the absence of GHG standards, lack of technical inputs, absence of technology transfer, and non-vital role of the private sector, Pakistan’s reliance on fossil fuel is bound to manifold its environmental and air pollution challenges. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter have a direct impact on vulnerable communities, who already lack healthcare facilities, face economic inequality and live in vicious cycles of poverty. Toxic air is compounding respiratory diseases, increasing the disease burden and premature deaths amongst these communities. Over the last two decades, Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in disease burden, particularly from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as ischemic heart diseases, strokes, lung disease and cancers, with air pollution being a major risk factor.
These diseases account for over 50pc of total deaths in Pakistan. Premature deaths from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, stroke, and asthma are on the rise. These are largely caused by outdoor fine particles, particularly in major urban centres of Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, where ambient air quality levels exceed World Health Organisation (WHO) safe limits by 10-15 times. As the third most air-polluted country in the world, air pollution in Pakistan traps generations in poverty by harming children’s health and cognitive development, besides hampering their potential. Families struggle to escape as pollution exacerbates unemployment, education gaps, and healthcare access.
Moreover, the ADB’s newly updated Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), launched in 2024, establishes safeguards to minimise environmental harm and protect communities affected by its projects. The framework covers nine key standards: environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, labour conditions, biodiversity, pollution control, and climate resilience.
However, its weak enforcement and loopholes for continued coal financing — lack of meaningful consultation with communities, CSOs, and women’s rights organisations; promotion of resource-intensive and environmentally destructive energy alternatives or “false solutions”; lack of clarity on the extent to which ADB’s safeguards and accountability mechanism — undermine its credibility as a tool for environmental and social justice.
The myth of ‘clean coal’
In recent years, the ADB has sought to justify its continued coal investments in Pakistan by promoting supercritical technology as adequate pollution control. However, this technology does not fully address the health and environmental consequences of coal combustion.
While supercritical plants may offer modest efficiency improvements, they still emit dangerous levels of particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) — pollutants directly linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths in surrounding communities.
 
 

In practice, most carbon capture projects in Pakistan and elsewhere utilise the trapped CO₂ for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), a process that extends the life of fossil fuel extraction rather than phasing it out. Underground CO₂ storage carries significant risks, including methane leakage — a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO₂ in the short term — and groundwater contamination.
Displacement, land grabbing, and broken promises
ADB-funded fossil fuel projects have also inflicted severe social costs on Pakistani communities. Large-scale coal-linked infrastructure, such as roads and transmission lines, has caused forced evictions in Sindh and Punjab. This has prompted residents of the Karachi Northern Bypass Highway to file complaints over violations of ADB’s resettlement safeguards.
Meanwhile, farmers in Thatta and Badin faced delayed compensation and exclusion from project consultations, sparking protests in 2021. The Bank’s own monitoring has also admitted to “gaps in grievance redressal”.
The ADB’s energy transition mechanism and enhanced transparency framework also have gaps in addressing gendered impacts on health, land rights and land-based livelihoods, unpaid care work, gender-based violence (GBV), energy access, changes to gendered power dynamics in households and communities, employment, and decent work.
On the other hand, labour conditions remain dire, with inadequate contracts, unsafe workplaces, and suppressed rights persisting despite the Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework.
The Bank’s Accountability Mechanism Policy (2012), now under review, must prioritise people. The lender must recognise that project-affected communities bear the brunt of pollution, land loss, and health risks when accountability fails. The mechanism’s redesign must ensure transparency, redressal, and meaningful participation to prevent further harm.
Heat stress, failing crops, and a looming food crisis
Pakistan now faces record-breaking 50°C summers, with ADB-funded coal projects in heat-stressed regions worsening the agricultural crisis. These projects emit methane (CH₄), ozone, and black carbon, byproducts of fossil fuels, and are linked to crop yield losses and diminished crop quality in wheat and rice.
 
 

Simultaneously, PM2.5 from coal and farm fires reduces photosynthesis, while erratic rainfall and heat disrupt growing cycles. Livestock develop pollution-linked respiratory diseases. In the long term, by 2100, South Asia could experience up to a 50pc yield loss in staple crops, with countries like Pakistan especially vulnerable due to reliance on water-intensive crops.
Climate finance and ADB’s clean air agenda
Clean air must be central to the ADB’s climate finance agenda. Less than 1pc of international development funding and only 2pc of international public climate finance was targeted towards air pollution action from 2015 to 2021.
The Bank must bridge this gap by scaling investments in clean energy and pollution control — through solar microgrids and methane capture — instead of just CO₂ cuts. Its energy transition mechanism should tie coal phase-outs to measurable air quality gains, aligning with Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and, by extension, its clean air plans. Without binding air quality safeguards, the ADB’s ‘climate finance’ risks fuelling the very crises it claims to solve.
Pakistan is at the forefront of the climate crisis and is trapped in a debt burden. The ADB must prioritise the rights and needs of the Pakistani people over debt servicing. Debt cancellation is critical for Pakistan to build climate-resilient infrastructure, provide clean air, and establish social safety nets for the people of Pakistan.
Integrating the right to clean air
In 2024, Pakistan took a historic step by amending its Constitution to include Article 9A, which guarantees the right to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental human right. The UN General Assembly’s landmark 2022 resolution explicitly recognises access to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a universal human right. This mandate compels institutions like the ADB to mainstream this principle into their core mission and country strategies.
The ADB must ensure its Just Energy Transition Mechanisms (JETMs) and coal phase-out frameworks — such as the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) — actively safeguard this right.
The global lender must also mandate real-time, project-level disclosure of all GHGs and Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) — especially methane and black carbon — from its funded projects in Pakistan. This aligns with the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework and the Global Methane Pledge, which Pakistan joined in 2023.
To effectively reduce fossil fuel dependence and harmful emissions in Pakistan, the ADB must strategically redirect financing toward scalable clean energy technologies while implementing rigorous accountability measures. This shift would align with the ADB’s own 2023–2032 Climate Transition Framework, which prioritises “low-carbon technology transfer” but lacks enforceable benchmarks for fossil fuel phaseouts.
The Bank’s annual meeting offers a crucial opportunity to correct course to shift from funding pollution to financing solutions. For the sake of millions of Pakistanis breathing poisoned air and farming on a heating planet, the answer must be clear.</p><small>2025-05-05 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603202-irsa-starts-providing-indented-supplies-to-four-federating-units' target='_blank'><strong>IRSA releases full indented water shares amid increased river flows</strong></a><br><p>

In doing so, New Delhi has also chosen to ignore warnings from its own experts that such an arbitrary step risks threatening regional stability by having ripple effects on water cooperation within the wider Indus River basin shared by India, Pakistan, China and Afghanistan, besides causing it reputational loss and damaging its image as a responsible nation.
 
 

This is not the first attempt by India to exit the treaty brokered by the World Bank in 1960 or try to force Pakistan to agree to modify it. Since the 2016 armed attack on an Indian army brigade headquarters in Uri, India has consistently tried to weaken the IWT in an attempt to wiggle out of it.
Practically, the treaty has remained interrupted for the past three years to the extent of the suspension of the meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission, a joint forum comprising experts from India and Pakistan created under the treaty to tackle disputes regarding the sharing of the waters at the bilateral level before invoking other dispute resolution mechanisms. The exchange of flood and other technical information has also been downgraded.

Whatever legal remedies are available to Pakistan under the provisions of the relevant international laws, the battle for its water rights is sure to be a long and tedious one

The commissioners from the two sides are required by the treaty to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. Following up on the suspension of the mandatory Commission meetings, India has twice served notices — first in January 2023 and the second in September 2024 — to Pakistan to “renegotiate” the terms of the treaty, citing fundamental and unforeseen changes in circumstances like demographic shifts, climate change, implementation challenges, etc.
Under international law, particularly the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, changes of circumstances are not recognised as grounds for terminating or suspending treaties. If India unilaterally revokes the treaty, it would jeopardise other major transboundary water agreements. Once a precedent is set, according to one commentator, it becomes easier for other players to follow it without much difficulty.
Even though India has allegedly harboured a desire to abrogate the IWT for quite some time, the Permanent Indus Commission’s meetings were suspended and notices served to Islamabad for the reassessment of the pact in the wake of Pakistan’s opposition to the Ratle project and the ongoing dispute over Kishanganga’s design.
The treaty allows the upper riparian to build “run-of-the-river” hydroelectric projects on the Western rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — accounting for 80 per cent of the Indus Basin’s total flows, provided they do not impound or divert the river waters through the construction of significant storage infrastructure. But disputes have emerged between the two countries over the size of the reservoirs, as well as project designs that Islamabad fears are tweaked to create water storage in violation of the agreement.
Experts believe the suspension of the treaty will allow India to modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan. Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan. Besides, it may alter the seasonal release of water from its reservoirs.
“New Delhi will now flush and refill reservoirs not during the monsoon but in the dry season — from October to February — disrupting Pakistan’s sowing season,” said a note by Islamabad-based think tank Jinnah Institute. And in the long term, India plans to construct and upgrade a cascade of dams along the Indus system, raising fears of both ecological degradation and regional instability.
The note, however, argues that India cannot cut off water to Pakistan without enormous engineering and environmental adjustments on its side and potentially enormous financial and political costs. Diversion is also unrealistic, as it requires the construction of channels or tunnels over unstable terrain, which risks flooding upstream Indian territories and destroying local ecosystems.
However, it says India can very well manipulate seasonal releases or withhold flood data, which will disrupt Pakistan’s crop cycles, increase costs and disturb crop yields downstream, especially during months when water flows are limited. Thus, the most immediate risk is the introduction of uncertainty. “Pakistan’s agricultural and energy systems have been built around predictability that has held for decades. The erosion of treaty protections could undermine those assumptions.”
It maintains that there is also the risk of inviting retaliatory precedents from other upper riparians. “Weaponising water tarnishes diplomatic capital with neighbours like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh closely watching India’s conduct on shared water systems. If India disregards Pakistan’s rights, it reinforces perceptions that New Delhi is willing to use water as a political tool. This could undermine ongoing and future negotiations over the transboundary Koshi, Teesta and Ganga River systems.
“Becoming the first state in this century to openly weaponise water will carry a major global stigma. Such a move would undercut its claim to regional leadership, open the door to international criticism and invite comparisons India will find difficult to defend.”
Pakistan says any attempt to stop or divert the flow of its waters as per the IWT and the usurpation of its rights as a lower riparian is an act of war, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledging to respond with full force. A Reuters report quotes Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for law and justice, as saying that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator, against India over its move to suspend the treaty.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said. “Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Malik said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon” and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.
He added that Islamabad was considering a fourth diplomatic option to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council. Whatever legal remedies are available to Pakistan under the treaty’s provisions and the relevant international laws, the battle for the preservation of the IWT and its water rights will be a very long and tedious one for the country. And it will mostly be fought in diplomatic circles.

Basically, the fact that we have a huge youth population of digital natives not only makes us a potential powerhouse as a consumer market but also an attractive source of raw talent. While the argument has merit, it’s not without caveats, which have an inverse relation with optimism.
Traditionally, the counterpoints to the promise of demographic dividend have varied from the substandard quality of the education system to the more macroeconomic explanations, particularly the declining purchasing power. But of late, a new variable, artificial intelligence (AI), has been introduced into the mix, whose direction and quantum of impact are still a topic of debate. It’s not just about Pakistan: advancements in AI have prompted loads of predictions on the potential effect on employment.
On the one hand, you have the techno-libertarians dreaming of a future where all jobs, and even interactions, will be done between agents as the ultimate utopia. Others are more cautious in their aspirations and point to what it would mean for the people, never mind the increase in business productivity. The safer position is obviously that economies can leverage AI to both improve efficiency and keep jobs intact, albeit with a different composition.
Though any and all of these may be true, there is a need to have a better understanding of both the challenges and opportunities posed by AI to Pakistan with regard to both employment and gross domestic product. In economic theory, output is a function of capital and labour inputs, as well as total factor productivity.

Only 12.7pc of our labour force is employed in occupation groups that can be deemed to have exposure to AI

Broadly speaking, there are potentially two opposing forces at play. While technological advancements such as generative AI, typically represented by total factor productivity, should help boost output, they will also reduce the need for labour inputs through automation. For now, their magnitude isn’t exactly clear, but existing literature gives us some indication of which areas are prone to AI adoption.
By and large, there is a consensus among economists and researchers that the most recent wave of AI will impact the service sectors the most — a fact that all of us ‘knowledge workers’ have firsthand experienced, whether for research, data analysis or any other task. As per the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, telecom, media, and IT services stand out in AI across four dimensions, ie human capital, innovation, exposure and usage.
In this regard, Pakistan’s sector-wise composition may give a sense of relief, considering that more than a third of our labour force is engaged in agriculture, forestry & fishing, as per the 2020-21 survey. Construction, which employs 9.5pc of the people, is also believed to be less exposed to genAI.
Meanwhile, services are likely to be most vulnerable and employ 37.5pc of the labour force, though the share of ‘knowledge workers’ is understandably much smaller. Another approach to gauge the impact is to look at the employment composition of occupation groups. Generally, advanced economies tend to have a higher share of workers in professional, managerial, and technical occupations with high AI exposure, which can either help augment their capabilities (such as professionals or managers) or replace them (eg clerical support).
This is where Pakistan’s advantage of backwardness manifests itself: only 12.7pc of our labour force is employed in occupation groups that can be deemed to have exposure to AI. Of that, professionals and managers make up more than half (7.5pc) and have a complementarity factor. In other words, they are likely to be augmented, not displaced, by AI.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of literature on the exact magnitude in the local context. However, we can take India as a peer as the underlying employment structure is somewhat similar. There, the impact of AI is supposed to be quite minimal due to a smaller share of people occupied in ‘knowledge’ work.
However, the sense of relief is at least partially misplaced, given Pakistan’s long-term productivity challenges. At around 1pc, the country’s mean growth in GDP per worker between 1992 and 2001 has been lower than all our peers and below the South Asian and lower-middle income averages. So even if the impact of AI may not be as high in terms of jobs automation, there’s no denying the fact that our labour force is already way behind the curve in even quasi-natural intelligence.
Similarly, the consequences can be dire within small pockets where IT and other business services are a great case in point. Both of them, particularly the latter, are important sources of forex inflows and almost entirely rely on labour arbitrage to deliver low-value work and therefore, are highly exposed to AI. While the Labour Force Survey gives no such breakdown, these two sectors employ around a million people and are already fighting a race to the bottom approach in terms of costs against other cheap markets. How will they compete against machines?

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 5th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-05 04:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681801d4bfc46.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908544/local-businesses-wary-of-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Local businesses wary of conflict</strong></a><br><p>Corporate Pakistan may share in the patriotic surge across the country, but business leaders, mindful of the risks, are calling for swift de-escalation of tensions with India. Some warn the conflict threatens South Asia’s economic potential, especially as global trade pivots toward regional integration.
They note the rising pressure on the capital market, currency, and supply chains — particularly in sectors such as pharmaceuticals that depend on imports of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients from India. If tensions persist, they warn, business losses will be unavoidable.
“Pakistan’s economy is just beginning to recover, with the public still waiting to feel the gains. War would divert scarce resources towards military spending, deepening the country’s development challenges. We simply can’t afford such an adventure,” a business leader said privately.
Hostilities spiked after the Pahalgam incident, with the Modi government instantly blaming Pakistan and announcing a series of unilateral measures. These included authorising military action, suspending the 1960 Water Treaty, closing the Wagah border, expelling Pakistani embassy staff, halting visa processing for Pakistani citizens, and ordering Pakistani visitors to leave. Later, India also closed its airspace to Pakistani flights.

If tensions persist, economic losses will be unavoidable especially as global trade pivots toward regional integration

In response, Pakistan unveiled countermeasures: it threatened to revoke the 1972 Simla Accord, closed its side of the Wagah border effective May 1, expelled all Indian nationals except Sikh pilgrims, suspended South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation visas for Indians, cut Indian High Commission staff in Islamabad to 30, closed its airspace to Indian aircrafts, and halted all trade with India.
The full economic and human toll of the current tit-for-tat measures will take time to unfold, but early fallout in Pakistan is evident. Escalating border tensions have already triggered losses, with the KSE-100 index dropping 3,055 points since the April 22 Pahalgam attack. The rupee hasn’t sharply depreciated, but its earlier stability has given way to volatility, fluctuating between Rs280 and Rs284 per dollar in the open market.
Musadaq Zulqarnain, a leading exporter and widely regarded as a voice of reason in Pakistan’s corporate sector, stated: “It’s hard to gauge the full impact at this stage, but I hope better sense will prevail”. On the effects on his own enterprise, he noted, “We haven’t seen any impact yet, our customers are preoccupied with the global disruptions caused by theUS tariffs.”
His greater concern, however, was for the vulnerable people who would suffer if the conflict escalates. Mr Zulqarnain also observed that global issues, such as Gaza, the war in Ukraine and US-Iran talks, have overshadowed the situation in South Asia.
Muhammad Ali Tabba, a prominent business leader, remained unfazed. “I don’t see a real threat of war. Both countries must show restraint, it’s in their mutual interest. India should prioritise restoring normal ties with Pakistan; sincere engagement can drive growth and reduce poverty on both sides.”
He downplayed concerns about business fallout: “The tensions have had minimal impact, just a brief market jitter. I believe major powers will pressure India to avoid escalation that could trigger a wider conflict.”
Dr Sheikh Kaisar Waheed, former chairman Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association warned that while the impact may not be immediate, prolonged tensions could lead to shortages of life-saving medicines. “Shipments from India have arrived at the port but aren’t being released. Customs officials haven’t provided a reason, despite SRO 977, which exempts essential pharmaceutical imports,” he said.
Banks, Mr Waheed added, are also refusing to open letters of credit or honour contracts. He noted that Indian suppliers remain willing to do business, unaffected by political rhetoric. Recalling a similar episode in 2019, he said the government then allowed continued imports of critical medicines and ingredients through SRO 977, which, he believes, is still in effect.
Chaudhry Muhammad Saeed, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, responded in detail: “Hostilities between Pakistan and India have become a recurring pattern, but this time India’s attitude appears excessive, likely driven by internal political pressures. War would be disastrous for both sides, especially for Pakistan, whose economy is only beginning to recover. Each missile costs millions, and beyond the immediate destruction, the economic fallout is far greater.
“Pakistan has exercised restraint and pursued diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions so far, with some success. But we need a long-term strategy; continued hostility is holding us back. With global trade increasingly region-focused, South Asia must tap its vast potential. CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor] could be a key enabler, boosting exports, transit trade and foreign investment. It’s time to revisit our policies. A neutral investigation into the incident, with Pakistan’s participation, could open the door for a new beginning,” he added.
Moin Mohajir, former Deputy Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, downplayed the likelihood of a full-scale war citing nuclear deterrence. “India may be driving the current tensions, but despite the rhetoric, it won’t risk self-destruction. After applying maximum pressure and seeking to isolate Pakistan, it will ultimately step back.
“Though retired, the current tensions are weighing on my mind and my Pakistan Stock Exchange investments, which have plunged since the Pahalgam attack. I also worry that a prolonged downturn will erode my future dividends. So, I strongly support peace and while my lone voice may not matter, I’m ready to join any collective advocating dialogue between the two nuclear states,” he remarked.
Commenting on global inaction over escalating South Asian tensions, Mr Mohajir cited two key reasons: first, the geopolitical divide, with major powers, particularly the US and more subtly, Russia, seeking to elevate India as a counterweight to China; and second, widespread economic interests, including those of Muslim countries, that avoid confronting India for fear of losing access to its 1.5 billion-strong consumer market and low-cost exports.

On his first day in office in January 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order freezing all USAID and State Depart­ment programmes for 90 days. Subsequently, several statements came directly from President Trump and senior officials citing numerous USAID-funded projects across countries that were labelled as ‘waste’, ‘abuse’, and ‘fraud’. In reference to Pakistan, Congressman Scott Perry alleged that USAID spent $840 million on education-related programmes in the last 20 years, including $136m to build 120 schools. He stated that there is zero evidence any single school was actually built. These revelations are startling and need to be substantiated.
Prima facie, the Trump administration’s allegations and its frustration with USAID seem plausible. The ‘insane’ priorities in some countries, including the multimillion-dollar funding for LGBT advocacy, sex changes, and media organisations, do not align with the professed objectives of international aid; ie, poverty alleviation or bro­ad­­er economic development. The decision, however, impacted activities worldwide totalling about $42 billion in 157 countries for over 6,100 activities covering all sectors. Those directly affected, particularly more than 10,000 USAID staff working all over the world, strongly criticised the decision. Six weeks into its suspension, Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared they were cancelling 83 per cent of USAID programmes. The surviving approximately 1,000 programmes will now be administered under the Department of State.
We don’t know how events will ultimately unfold in the US as legal battles are still ongoing. However, as things stand, the USAID has been dismantled and US aid to developing countries will be reduced substantially. The US isn’t the first country to shut down its international aid agency. In June 2020, Boris Johnson, the UK’s then prime minister, used budget-tightening as a ground to effectively close the DFID — Britain’s equivalent of USAID — and merged it with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Following the USAID fiasco, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced the UK would increase spending on defence by cutting its aid budget from 0.5pc of gross national income to 0.3pc, much lower than the UN’s 0.7pc aid target. The UK aid budget is now at its lowest in decades. The UK is not alone — France and Germany have also cut aid budgets in recent years.

The demise of USAID could present developing nations with an opportunity to reduce aid dependency.

For recipient countries, these disruptions are unlikely to have any major sociopolitical or economic consequences. For instance, Pakistan will not experience a significant financial squeeze. In 2023, USAID committed only $132.6m across various sectors. This funding was reduced to $116m in 2024, primarily due to a decline in humanitarian assistance. These funding levels are negligible relative to the size of Pakistan’s $375bn economy. The same holds true for most African countries, where USAID’s spending is minimal. Nevertheless, the aid that actually reaches intended beneficiaries is only a small fraction of overall disbursement figures.
So, will these aid cuts have any significant impact on the developing countries’ overall economic growth? Research studies provide little convincing evidence of a positive relationship between economic growth and the volume of aid received. However, the situation could potentially change if the US also withdraws from the IMF, World Bank, and other multilateral development banks. Such decisions seem unlikely; however, if taken, they would be bad for the US. By abandoning the IMF and the World Bank, the US would surrender a key source of global influence and economic leverage.
The US has long maintained tight control over these institutions, shaping their policies and leadership to align with its own national interests. It has consistently appointed the World Bank’s president, approved Europe’s choice to lead the IMF, and selected the Fund’s first deputy managing director. Moreover, it remains the only country with the power to unilaterally block major decisions, as both institutions require an 85pc majority for approval.
The US also uses IMF as a ‘first responder’ to safeguard its economy and uses the World Bank to strengthen security and economic alliances and support postwar reconstruction in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. Even so, the actual cost of US participation in these institutions is far lower than often assumed. Each year, the US Treasury assesses the financial impact of its contributions to the IMF; in 2023, it reported an unrealised gain of $407m.
Even if the US pulls out from the multilateral organisations, other countries will save the multilateral system. They may be alarmed, but they are not powerless. In doing so, however, the US would forfeit vital tools for supporting its allies and withholding financing from its adversaries.
Also, Western countries’ retreat from aid will leave an obvious opening for other powers to inc­rease influence in developing nations. China continues to signal investment commitments in Afri­­ca. At the 2024 Forum on China-Africa Coope­ra­tion, it pledged $51bn over three years in loans and traditional aid. The Gulf states are also incr­easing aid, largely in strategically important regions.
In principle, the demise of 63-year-old USAID, while difficult for many people, could present developing nations with an opportunity to reduce aid dependency and achieve sustainable economic growth. Sometimes good things can come from adversity. Over time, as the system stabilises, donor agencies may become more accountable to the taxpayers who fund them.
Clearly, international aid is a broken system desperately in need of fundamental reforms, both within donor agencies and recipient nations. The mismanagement of aid is pervasive and extends be­­­yond USAID. Donor agencies — funded by taxpayer dollars — are fraught with issues ranging from resource misallocation and misutilisation to a glaring lack of accountability for failed prog­r­a­m­mes. The USAID review has also exposed the high-handed culture prevalent within donor agencies, and should prompt other countries to scrutinise the operations of their own aid organisations.

Each crisis has been more complex and involved dangerous ramifications, which made it hard even when tensions eased to put ties back on track and return to any ‘normalcy’. Protracted periods of diplomatic disengagement followed these crises. The bilateral impasse only deepened as, when suspended, formal dialogue was difficult to resume. Little wonder that a once promising peace process advanced through what was called the ‘composite dialogue’ was never revived since it was halted over 12 years ago.
The ongoing crisis has already plunged relations between the nuclear neighbours into a vortex of dangerous confrontation. Tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by both sides, initiated by India, have gone much further than actions taken in past crises. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty weaponises water and has far-reaching im­­plications even if its immediate impact is limited. Exchange of small-arms fire continues along the Line of Control. The Indian Navy has been cond­u­cting long-range missile drills in the Arabian Sea, obliging Pakistan to intensify its naval activities.
Pakistani officials claim to have credible intelligence that India is preparing to launch a military strike. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statements about inflicting harsh punishment on the attackers and their backers has reinforced the possibility of kinetic action. He has given the army “operational freedom” to decide “the mode, targets and timing” of India’s response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack. War hysteria has also taken hold in India.
The danger of an impending military confrontation has evoked growing international concern and prompted calls for restraint. The UN secretary general, China, the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran, among others, have urged de-escalation. Historically, the US has had leverage with both countries — and still does — to play a role in defusing crises. It did so from the 1999 Kargil conflict to the last crisis in 2019. This time, contrary to speculation that Washington is too preoccupied elsewhere with other conflicts, it has engaged swiftly with both Islamabad and New Delhi to urge restraint and ask them to re-establish direct communication channels and work together to maintain peace and security.

Can a full-blown crisis between India and Pakistan be averted?

Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed this message in phone calls to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. The same message was delivered by former national security adviser Mike Waltz to army chief Gen Asim Munir and Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, days before Waltz was removed from that post. Calls were also made to DG ISI Gen Asim Malik by CIA director John Ratcliff and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Malik was recently appointed national security adviser, sparking speculation this was in preparation for talks later with Doval.
Whether US intervention will dissuade India from embarking on a military course remains to be seen. Indian media reports suggest the Modi government is examining several options that can inflict pain on Pakistan but stop short of triggering a broader conflict, especially as it cannot be sure of how Islamabad will react. For its part, Pakistan has said any kinetic action by India will be met by a “strong and decisive response”. This would heighten the risk of an uncontrolled escalatory cycle with uncertain consequences and outcome. The room for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation by either side will be high in the absence of any communication between them. Messaging through an intermediary — the US — might be helpful but will not eliminate that risk.
The past is not a perfect guide, as no two situations are ever the same, but it may be instructive to recall what happened the last time around. The February 2019 crisis erupted after a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district, in which 40 Indian security personnel were killed. Blaming Pakistan for the attack, Indian officials warned of a strong response. Twelve days later, Indian Mirage jets crossed the Line of Control to carry out a bombing raid in Balakot, claiming this destroyed ‘terrorist training camps’ and killed militants. Pakistan was to later show that the site of the bombing was a forested area and there were no casualties or damage. Pakistan retaliated by launching Operation Swift Retort entailing air strikes on a military target in Jammu. That too caused little if any damage.
However, in an aerial combat an Indian Mig-21 was shot down by Pakistan and its pilot captured. His release became the key point in defusing the crisis when tensions were escalating to a dangerous level. The climax came when Pakistan determined India was about to attack having deployed and pointed nine missiles at Pakistan. This was conveyed by Pakistan’s foreign secretary to key foreign envoys including the US along with the warning that Pakistan will be compelled to retaliate. “For every Indian missile readied, three Pakistani missiles would be ready in response,” according to a former official. India therefore had to be stopped. The US was engaged at the working level with both sides, but this led to more senior-level involvement. Washington had in any case started pressing for restraint after the Indian strike in Balakot. Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo claims in his memoir Never Give An Inch that nuclear escalation became a real possibility as each side thought the other was about to deploy nuclear weapons.
Hectic shuttle diplomacy by the US and Pakistan’s effort to de-escalate the situation led to the government’s decision to release the pilot. His release provided an off-ramp from the crisis and helped to defuse it. In his book Anger Management, Ajay Basaria, former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, claims India’s coercive diplomacy produced this outcome. In a campaign speech later, Modi suggested a ‘qatal ki raat’ (night of murder) was in the offing if the pilot hadn’t been freed. Refuting Basaria’s version, Islamabad attributed the pilot’s release to Pakistan’s “responsible behaviour” in de-escalating the situation while demonstrating its capacity to respond to any security threat.
A combination of fortuitous factors, active third-party intervention and a concrete ‘peace gesture’ in the midst of escalating tensions helped to end that crisis. Luck also played a part, as many experts have pointed out. The question is whether there are any favourable factors in play today that can halt the ongoing escalation and avert a head-on clash.

“I would … I’d like to see it done,” Trump told the NBC News programme “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” in an interview taped on Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, that is airing across the US on Sunday.
Trump said he had a “sweet spot” for the app after it helped him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election, adding, “TikTok is — it’s very interesting, but it will be protected”. Trump has already twice granted a reprieve from enforcement of a congressionally mandated ban on TikTok that was initially due to take effect in January.
 


A deal had been in the works that would spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new firm based in the United States and majority-owned and operated by US investors but it was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Democratic senators argue that Trump has no legal authority to extend the deadline, and suggest that the deal that had been under consideration would not meet legal requirements.
One source close to ByteDance’s US investors said last month that work on the prospective deal continues ahead of the June 19 deadline, but the White House and Beijing would need to resolve the tariff dispute first.
Trump told NBC News that China was keen to reach an agreement, citing the impact that 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods were having on its economy.
The law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 unless ByteDance had completed a divestiture of the app’s US assets. Trump began his second term as president on Jan 20 and opted not to enforce it. He first extended the deadline to early April, and then again last month to June 19.

Renowned Pakistan climber Sajid Ali Sadpara completed his acclimatisation rotation on Dhaulagiri, 8,167m peak, the world’s seventh highest mountain in Nepal.
Mr Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and started his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.
Talking to Dawn, he said he had completed the rotation at the peak and now waiting for weather to improve to start his summit push.
He said the summit push would start on May 9 considering weather forecast. He said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support in Alpine style.
Son of legendary mountaineer late Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Sajid has already summited the world’s eight peaks above eight thousand metres, including the world’s second highest peak, K2, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II in Alpine style.
He also took part in rescue operations at many peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 eight-thousanders peaks in Alpine style.
After climbing the Dhaulagiri peak without oxygen, he would be the summiteer of nine eight-thousanders peaks without supplement oxygen and porter support.
Naila Kiani aiming to summit Kanchenjunga
Also, renowned Pakistani female mountaineer Naila Kiani started her adventure to climb Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
According to a statement issued on Sunday, she is currently en route to the base camp of Kanchenjunga, an overland journey that will take her seven days to finish.
This expedition marks a significant step in her quest to climb all 14 of the world’s peaks exceeding 8,000m.
Ms Kiani has already summited 11 of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m. This includes Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gashe­rbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu. She is the first and the only Pakistani woman to achieve this feat.
Sirbaz Khan, Wajidullah Nagri
Likewise, Pakistani climber Sirbaz Khan also started his adventure towards Kanchenjunga peak to attempt summit the peak in Alpine style to compete summit of all 14 eight-thousanders.
He had successfully summited the Annapurna peak in Nepal without using supplementary oxygen on April 7.
Mr Khan is the first Pakistani climber to have summited all the top 14 mountains in the world. He is also the first Pakistani to scale 13 of them in Alpine style — without oxygen support, according to Karrar Haidri, the secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan.
The only remaining peak for Mr Khan to complete the list is Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
After climbing the peak, Sirbaz Khan will be first and only Pakistani to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in Alpine style.
Meanwhile, Pakistani mountaineer Wajidullah Nagri also reached the base camp of the Everest to start attempt to summit the peak.
Wajidullah Nagari has already summited K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum-II in Pakistan.

GCC Secretary-General Jasem Albudaiwi, speaking on behalf of the six-nation bloc, called on both countries to exercise restraint and prioritize diplomacy following a recent deadly attack in the India-occupied region of  Jammu and Kashmir.
Mr Albudaiwi strongly condemned the terrorist attack targeting tourists in Pahalgam,  which resulted in the deaths of 27 Hindus. He reiterated the GCC’s  “principled and consistent  stance in rejecting all forms and manifestations of terrorism.”
“We call for restraint from all parties and urge immediate resumption of  direct talks between Pakistan and India,” Albudaiwi said in statements reflecting the council’s concerns. He stressed the importance of resolving disputes peacefully according to international law and the  UN Charter to ensure regional stability.

Renews call for international backing to implement UN resolution on Kashmir

The secretary-general also warned against scapegoating and the “rising tide of Islamophobia in the region,” cautioning that discriminatory rhetoric could further inflame tensions.
Serious threat to regional peace
Highlighting the potential impact on global geopolitics, Albudaiwi emphasised that the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours poses a serious threat to regional peace.
 
 

The  GCC renewed its call for the international community to “intensify its efforts” toward finding a peaceful resolution to the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir issue, underscoring the need to adhere to relevant UN  Security Council resolutions.
The call for dialogue comes amid severely strained relations between India and Pakistan, with diplomatic interactions significantly reduced in recent years.
The  GCC, a political and economic alliance comprising Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, reaffirmed its commitment to supporting regional stability.
Separately, the  Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s human rights arm on Saturday voiced serious alarm over what it described as an alarming rise in  Islamophobia and violence against Muslims in India and India-held  Kashmir after the Pahalgam attack.
The OIC’s Independent Permanent  Human Rights Commission (IPHRC) condemned the “unfounded scapegoating”  of Muslim communities, attributing it to “far-right Hindu nationalist  groups.” The commission urged India to protect its Muslim citizens,  uphold international human rights obligations, and bring perpetrators of hate crimes to justice.
Regarding Kashmir, the IPHRC  reiterated its rejection of India’s “unilateral and illegal actions”  since August 2019, aimed at altering the region’s demography. It called  for international pressure on India to abide by UN resolutions, allow  Kashmiri self-determination, release political prisoners, and permit access for rights groups and fact-finding missions.

ADB President Masato Kanda announced the new target during the bank’s annual meeting in Milan, Italy. The expansion builds on the ADB’s September 2022 pledge to provide $14bn by 2025 to ease a worsening food crisis in the region and improve long-term food security.
By  the end of 2024, the ADB had committed $11bn — about 80 per cent of the  original allocation — with an additional $3.3bn programmed for  2025, the bank said.
“Unprecedented droughts, floods, extreme heat, and degraded natural resources are  undermining agricultural production, while at the same time threatening food security and rural livelihoods,” Mr Kanda said.

Move aims to counter growing threats to food production from climate change impacts and resource degradation

The assistance will fund a programme covering the entire food production process, from farming and processing to distribution and consumption.  Through financing and policy support for governments and companies, the programme aims to help the region generate diverse and nutritious food,  create jobs, reduce environmental impacts and promote resilient agricultural supply chains.
The additional $26bn announced on Sunday will include $18.5bn in direct ADB support for governments and $7.5bn in private sector investments. The ADB aims for private sector investments to account for more than 27pc of the total $40bn programme by 2030.
The programme will work to modernize agricultural value chains to improve access to affordable and healthy food, especially for vulnerable populations. It will also invest in improving soil quality and  conserving biodiversity, which the ADB noted are essential for productive agriculture but increasingly threatened by climate change,  pollution, and habitat loss. Support for digital technology and analytics aims to improve decision-making for farmers, agribusinesses and policymakers.
More than half of the world’s undernourished people live in developing Asia,  according to the ADB. Food systems account for 70pc of global water use,  50pc of habitable land, and 80pc of biodiversity loss, while employing  40pc of the region’s workforce, the bank said.
To aid the effort, the ADB is establishing the Natural Capital Fund, a planned $150 million blended finance vehicle. It has anchor support from the Global Environment Facility and expects contributions from other partners, including the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme.  This fund will support projects by farmers and innovators focused on sustainable natural capital management.
Food  insecurity threatens to reverse decades of development progress in the  region, where the ADB estimates nearly 1.1bn people lacked healthy  diets due to poverty and high food prices, which soared in 2022.
Global agrifood systems generate hidden environmental, social and health costs estimated at $13 trillion in 2023, or 10pc of global GDP, according to  the Food System Economics Commission. These costs stem from emissions,  land-use changes, water depletion, poverty among workers and diet-related health issues.
The commission noted that productivity losses from poor diets rose 14pc  globally since 2016, with South Asia seeing a 20pc increase,  highlighting the need for reforms beyond traditional production-focused strategies.

The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
The Israeli military said “several attempts were made to intercept” the missile that was launched from Yemen, a rare Houthi attack that penetrated Israel’s air defences.
An Israeli official said the country’s security cabinet would convene in the evening.

Netanyahu blames Iran as defence minister threatens seven times stronger response

A police video showed officers standing on the edge of a deep hole in the ground with the control tower visible behind them. No damage was reported to the airport infrastructure.
The police reported a “missile impact” at Israel’s main international gateway.
An AFP photographer said the missile hit near the parking lots of Terminal 3, the airport’s largest. The crater was just hundreds of metres (yards) from the tarmac.
“You can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep,” central Israel’s police chief, Yair Hezroni, said in the video.
 
 

The Israel Airport’s Authority said: “This is the first time a missile has fallen so close to the terminal and the runways.”
“The missile force of the Yemeni armed forces carried out a military operation targeting Ben Gurion airport” with a “hypersonic ballistic missile”, the Houthis said, referring to their forces.
Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened a forceful response, saying: “Anyone who hits us, we will hit them seven times stronger.”
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond to Iran at  “a time and place of our choosing” over the attack  on Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport.
“Attacks  by the Houthis emanate from Iran. Israel will respond to the Houthi  attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our  choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,” Netanyahu wrote on X,  reposting a March message by US President Donald Trump also  attributing attacks by the Yemeni group to their Iranian backers.
Palestinians hail attack
Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad later hailed the Houthis’ attack on the airport.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.
An AFP journalist said he heard a “loud bang” at around 9:35 am (0635 GMT), adding the “reverberation was very strong”.
“Security staff immediately asked hundreds of passengers to take shelter, some in bunkers,” the AFP journalist said.
“Many passengers are now waiting for their flights to take off, and others are trying to find alternative flights.” An incoming Air India flight was diverted to Abu Dhabi, an airport official said
It was one of the airlines to suspend Tel Aviv flights until May 6, along with Germany’s Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian, Eurowings and SWISS.
A passenger said the attack, which came shortly after air raid sirens sounded across parts of Israel, caused “panic”.
An airline official said: “Today was a close call”.
“I have worked at the airport for several years but even I was afraid today,” they said.
Flights resumed after being halted briefly, with the aviation authority saying Ben Gurion was now “open and operational”.
Gaza war expansion
An Israel official said Israel’s security cabinet later met on Sunday, after media reported a planned expansion of the Gaza war with call-up orders issued for tens of thousands of reserve troops.
Several news outlets said the military had begun sending the orders for reservists to replace conscripts and active-duty soldiers in Israel and the occupied West Bank so they can be redeployed to Gaza.
A military spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports but Israel’s public broadcaster said the security cabinet would meet to discuss the expanded offensive.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid deadlock over how to proceed with a two-month ceasefire that had largely stopped the Gaza war.
Sunday’s attack on Israel was the fourth the Houthis have claimed in three days.
Israel claims to have intercepted most of the Houthis’ missiles fired since the Gaza war started.
In March, the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on shipping over Israel’s aid blockade on Gaza after a suspension of attacks during the truce.
The US military has been hammering Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15.

Though the Commi­ssioner for Indus Waters was not available to comment, a source privy to the development said that the report sent by the commission to government mentions a massive breach of the treaty in the form of construction of three hydroelectric plants / projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab. The construction of the 450MW had reportedly been started at Chenab basin in 2005, followed by 330MW Kishan Ganga Hydropower Project in 2010 at Jhelum river basin. The construction of 850MW Ratle Hydropower project is yet to be initiated.
“The report also contains the information about other violations of the treaty by India such as delaying or avoiding giving information regarding release of floodwater during monsoon in rivers, including Ravi and Satluj. Besides these, there are a series of violations India committed already,” said the source while talking to this scribe.
He further said a very recent major violation committed by India was holding the treaty in abeyance that is not at all allowed.
He further said the report also mentioned that New Delhi suspended the treaty unilaterally on the pretext of the Pahalgam attack last month.
 
 

According to another source, India always faced defeat whenever Pakistan challenged and raised objections on the design of the aforementioned projects and took up these issues on relevant forums, including neutral expert or international court of arbitration.
“The proceedings on a couple of projects including Ratle are still underway at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a non-UN intergovernmental organisation located in The Hague,” he said.
Talking to Dawn, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, a former commissioner on Indus Waters said in fact the draft of treaty finalised in 1960 gave no privilege to India to use waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab on which Pakistan had the full right to use.
“India had full right to use  the water of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj) whether through construction of dams (for water storage and power generation) or other purposes.”
He added that a few months before signing of the treaty, India had started building pressure on the authorities concerned to also allow it to construct run-of-the river hydropower projects and small storages for irrigation purposes in the catchment areas of the western rivers.
He said since a lot of work has already been done on the treaty and there was no time to further delay, it was decided to allow India do so, but with some restrictions / conditions such as consulting Pakistan while finalising design of the projects etc.
He urged the government to brief the UNSC in detail about a series of violations of the treaty India committed.
“The Pakistani team may also take up this issue with the World Bank immediately in a bid to get the India’s unilateral decision of holding treaty in abeyance scrapped,” he urged.

Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes­sage stating the acco­unts were withheld “in response to a legal demand”.
PPP condemned India’s move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India’s action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident” which he had presented before the international community.
The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “It also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,” the statement added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s narrative on the Pahalgam attack “unsettled the Indian prime minister”, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the “Butcher of Gujarat” before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi’s war-mongering mindset.
Since the Pahalgam attack on April 22, the Indian government has blocked a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.
X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.

The political leaders made this pledge during an in-camera briefing by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.
The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.
A source privy to the huddle proceedings told Dawn that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.

Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam

Another source told Dawn that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.
 
 

Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.
With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.
PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.
Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.
Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.

The devotees, including women and children, arrived from all over Pakistan and abroad for the three-day pilgrimage at the temple located in the mountains, around 140km west of Uthal.
It is considered one of the largest pilgrimage sites in Hindu civilisation.
The opening ceremony of the religious festival was held on April 2.
According to the organisers of the religious festival, a record turnout was witnessed this year, with around 200,000 pilgrims attending the festival across three days.

Three-day event concludes with record turnout of pilgrims

Pilgrims participated in various religious rituals, including the sacred bath in the Hingol River, offerings at the Chandragup mud volcano and worship inside the Hinglaj Mata cave temple.
The Shri Hinglaj Mata Welfare Mandli had set up round-the-clock food and drink stalls (Bhandara) for pilgrims, especially those who arrived barefoot, to fulfil their spiritual vows.
Senator Danesh Kumar, Lasbela Deputy Comm­issioner Humaira Baloch, Lasbela SSP Atif Ameer, tribal elders and senior government officials visited the festival and reviewed administrative and security arrangements.
Senator Kumar, who attended the closing ceremony, said the successful Hinglaj Mata festival and the participation of thousands of Hindu pilgrims proved that all minorities were enjoying religious freedom in Pakistan.
He said the Hindu community has three elected representatives in the Balochistan Assembly, with him representing the community in the Senate.
He said the Balochistan government made foolproof security arrangements for the festival and over 1,100 personnel of army, Frontier Corps, police and Levies were deployed for the participants’ safety.
He said the Lasbela district administration exten­ded full cooperation to the organisers.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority had made extensive arrangements for the event.
Pakistan Coast Guards also held a four-day free medical camp where male and female doctors treated pilgrims and provided free 
medicines.
The 5,000-year-old temple holds great reverence for Hindus worldwide. In 2006, former Indian foreign minister Jaswant Singh also visited the temple during his goodwill visit to Pakistan.
The annual festival at the holy site is a spiritual cornerstone for Pakistan’s Hindu community and a powerful symbol of interfaith harmony. Local Muslim tribes host and assist pilgrims, reflecting a long-standing tradition of religious tolerance and coexistence in the region.

An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
According to PTV News, national security issues were discussed in the camera session today, in the context of the Pahalgam false flag operation.
“Several leaders of political parties  participated in the session,” PTV News reported.
Sources say that the DG ISPR informed the leaders of political parties about the preparations of the army, PTV News reported, adding that DG Sharif said, “Pakistan is a peaceful country and wants peace in the region.”
“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.
It added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.
Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported that Lt Gen Chaudhry and Tarar would jointly brief the top leaders of “all political parties” on the situation with India today.
 
 

According to Radio Pakistan, the high-level background briefing would focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the “implications of recent developments”.
“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.
PTV News highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a “great example of national unity, solidarity and consensus”.
Without investigation, India had accu­s­ed “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers and escalated tensions with Pak­­i­s­tan through military and diplomatic actions.
India cancelled visas of Pak­istani travellers, held the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance, initiated ski­rmi­shes along the Line of Control (LoC) and hinted at potential airstrikes.
Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.
 
 

The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and tit-for-tat actions, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international calls for restraint and renewed dialogue.
In the latest show of strength, Pakistan yesterday successfully tested an improved version of its nuclear-capable Abdali missile, significantly increasing its range to 450 kilometres.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “swift, resolute and notch-up response”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war.
 
 

To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the LoC.
It is increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months and relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones.
PTI decides not to participate in briefing
Separately, in a statement on X, PTI said its participation in the briefing was “unnecessary” as the party believed there was “no serious attempt to create a national consensus” by the government and that there was no intention to include PTI founder Imran Khan either.
 






The party said it had always unequivocally condemned every kind of terrorism in all its forms.
It said that the government should have immediately convened a multi-party conference, so that a common course of action could have been drawn up by taking all parties into confidence.
“Unfortunately, the government wasted this opportunity,” the party said, adding that not only was the multi-party conference not convened, but instead, “a one-sided briefing is being given by a government minister”.
“Considering all these factors, the PTI political committee has unanimously decided that the party will not participate in the briefing,” the statement read.
Pakistan decides to brief UNSC on India’s aggressive actions: FO
Pakistan has decided to brief the United Nations Security Council on the latest situation in the region amid sky-high tensions with India, according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry today.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has directed Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps to convene a meeting of the Security Council.
“Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India’s aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,” the statement said.
“Pakistan will specifically highlight India’s illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,” it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi’s aggressive actions are jeopardising “peace and security” in the region.
“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present accurate facts to the international community.”
Iran FM arrives in Pakistan, will India next week
As several friendly countries and global powers have been attempting to reduce Pak-India tensions, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Pakistan late on Sunday night, according to a social media post by the FO.
The post on X said that Araghchi arrived in Islamabad on an official visit and was received by Additional Secretary West Asia Syed Asad Gillani, the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan and other senior officials.
“He (Araghchi) will hold important meetings with the Pakistani leadership, including the President, Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,” the FO wrote.
 






Earlier, Iran’s state news agency IRNA quoted Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei as saying that Araghchi was expected to visit Pakistan on Monday to “discuss the recent developments at the regional and international levels”.
 
 

Araghchi would also pay an official visit to India later next week, the spokesperson added. Iran’s semi-official Fars News and Mehr News Agency also reported the same.
Iran on April 25 had offered to mediate between Pakistan and India as tensions heightened in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. The next day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke on the phone with President Masoud Pezeshkian, welcoming Iran’s readiness to calm the situation.

Meanwhile, continuing his diplomatic engagements, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar today spoke on phone with his Malaysian counterpart, Dato Seri Mohamad Hassan, to brief him on the current regional developments.
FM Hasan, expressing support for Pakistan’s position, called for restraint by all parties, the Foreign Office said.

During their call, Dar “categorically rejected India’s provocative actions, including its baseless allegations [and] inflammatory propaganda”. He termed India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty “an outright violation of treaty provisions and international legal obligations”.
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security, Dar asserted that Pakistan reserved the “right to safeguard its sovereignty and national interest”.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close contact on the evolving situation, the FO added.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed “serious concerns” to Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim over the prevailing tensions because of India’s provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.
During a telephone conversation with his counterpart, PM Shehbaz categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without any evidence from the Indian government and reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an international, transparent, credible and neutral investigation to ascertain the facts.
He said Pakistan would welcome Malaysia’s participation in this investigation.
While stressing that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, PM Shehbaz highlighted Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the war against terror and the tremendous sacrifices of the country.
“India’s actions are distracting Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts on the western border,” he added.
He emphasised that it was unthinkable for Pakistan to get involved in such a controversy, particularly at a time when the country had just emerged from a “serious economic crisis and was back on the path to economic stability”.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday had called for restraint and the “urgent resumption of dialogue” between Pakistan and India to de-escalate the situation.
In a statement, the OIC General Secretariat expressed its “deep concern over the deteriorating security situation in the South Asian region”.
 


“It stressed the need to resolve differences through peaceful means, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter, to safeguard peace, security, and stability in South Asia.”
The OIC recalled the decisions of the Islamic Summit and the resolutions adopted by the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers that reaffirmed the organisation’s “unwavering support for the Jammu and Kashmir question”.
Noting that the unresolved issue of Kashmir remained the “core challenge to lasting peace and stability in the region”, the OIC urged the international community to intensify efforts to find a peaceful resolution to it, in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
Bilawal’s X account blocked in India
In a statement issued today, according to Associated Press of Pakistan, Bilawal House spokesperson Surendar Valasai condemned India’s move to block the X account of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
He described the action as a retaliatory response to the party leader’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident”.
The spokesperson said India’s move to block the PPP chairman’s X account proved that India was an undemocratic country and its premier was an “extremely cowardly person”.
Separately, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in reaction to the Indian step to block Bilawal’s X account, said that suppressing voices does not hide the truth.
She added that the Indian government should present evidence and not resort to censorship.
“Efforts to suppress critical voices are increasing concern not only in Pakistan but also globally,” the PPP leader said.

“I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,’” she said at a public event, referring to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal that described a tense exchange between the leaders.
During the recent call, Sheinbaum said, Trump had asked how he could help fight organised crime and suggested sending troops.
She said she declined, telling him that “we will never accept the presence of the United States Army in our territory”.
Sheinbaum said she offered to collaborate, including through greater information-sharing.
Trump himself said in an interview last week with conservative outlet The Blaze that he had offered to help Mexico fight the drug cartels, but that he had been turned down.
Without providing details, Trump told his interviewer: “You could say at some point maybe something’s gonna have to happen. It can’t go on the way it is.”
In her appearance on Saturday, Sheinbaum said she had urged Trump to stop the cross-border arms trafficking that has contributed to a wave of violence lasting nearly two decades, claiming more than 450,000 lives in Mexico.
Trump, on his part, has complained repeatedly about cross-border drug smuggling and has pressured Mexico to crack down on criminal cartels.
Trump angered Mexicans in early March when he said America’s southern neighbour was “dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control … posing a grave threat to (US) national security”.
Trump has also long complained — and uses as an argument for imposing tariffs on the country — that Mexico has not done enough to stop the trafficking of migrants and drugs, particularly fentanyl, into the United States.
Those topics have been part of an ongoing diplomatic dance between the countries over the trade tariffs.
Mexico, as the largest US trade partner and the second-largest economy in Latin America, is considered one of the most vulnerable to the US president’s expansive import duties.</p><small>2025-05-04 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04225800c1f39d7.jpg?r=225923' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417/pakistan-expands-india-trade-ban-to-include-transit-export-from-third-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expands India trade ban to include transit, export from third countries</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Sunday banned the import of Indian-origin goods transiting through Pakistan by land, sea and air and prohibited the transit of goods exported to India by third countries, a notification from the commerce ministry said.
An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, both nations have imposed tit-for-tat measures on each other in a tug-of-war started by India.
The notification, which has been seen by Dawn.com, stated that these bans would not be applicable to goods for which a bill of lading or letter of credit had already been issued.
The ministry banned, “the import of Indian origin goods by third countries via sea, land and air; transiting through Pakistan; goods imported from India by third countries via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan; [and] the exports of third countries, to India via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan”.
The notification stated that the federal government issued the orders “in the interest of national security and in public interest”.
Late on Saturday night, Pakistan banned the use of its ports by Indian flag carriers in a tit-for-tat response to India announcing that Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
An order issued by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p><small>2025-05-04 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603149-pakistan-india-tensions-dg-ispr-info-minister-brief-political-leaders-on-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>'Pakistan Army fully prepared to respond to Indian aggression': DG ISPR briefs political parties</strong></a><br><p>

Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice”, it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night.
Officials said the superstar’s huge free gig on the beach, her first concert in Brazil since 2012, drew up to two million people.
Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to the US pop diva’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters”.
It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” and Molotov cocktails as “a collective challenge with the aim of “gaining notoriety on social media”.
The police added that the group behind the plot “spread hate speech”, radicalised youths, and used self-harm on digital platforms as mechanisms to develop social belonging.
Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso.
Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong show on Copacabana beach in a year, after a huge concert last year by Madonna.
‘Scared sick’
Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed.
The 39-year-old star’s fans reacted with shock to the news of the foiled plot.
“Thank god. This would have had an impact on over 2m people,” posted the LadyGagaFansTogether Instagram account, which has 307,000 followers.
Writing on the same account, one fan said he was “scared sick about her (Gaga) being safe at all times”.
The gig was part of a strategy by Rio to hold mega-concerts in May in an effort to boost tourism during what is considered the low season.
All week, Gaga fans had flocked to Rio, a city famous for its annual Carnival that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world.
Mayor Eduardo Paes has also hinted that he plans to bring in Irish rock band U2, although no date has been given.
Lady Gaga had kicked off her show perched more than two metres (6.5 feet) above the stage in a massive scarlet hoop gown which opened to reveal a vertical cage from which her dancers exited to a rendition of her 2011 song “Bloody Mary”.
“Brazil, I missed you so much,” screamed the popstar, who performed several tracks from her latest album, “Mayhem”, as well as favourites from throughout her career.</p><small>2025-05-04 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04202920a3cb336.jpg?r=203413' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908412/trump-says-i-dont-know-if-must-uphold-us-constitution-as-president' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says ‘I don’t know’ if must uphold US Constitution as president</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said in a television interview airing on Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution.
He also said he is not seriously considering running for a third White House term, after musing publicly over an idea clearly barred by the nation’s founding legal document.
“I don’t know,” Trump responded when the host of NBC News programme ‘Meet the Press’, Kristen Welker, asked directly whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land.
Asked specifically whether American citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: “I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.”
The president’s aggressive moves to deport undocumented migrants — some without the benefit of a court hearing — have drawn widespread criticism, but Trump insists it is necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a “national emergency”.
The suggestion of possibly seeking a third term in office has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.
The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
But Trump said in March he was “not joking” about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are “methods” that would allow it to happen.
Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.
But “this is not something I’m looking to do”, Trump told NBC’s Welker, adding: “I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.”
Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance — calling him a “fantastic, brilliant guy” — and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while adding that “we have a lot of good people in this party.”</p><small>2025-05-04 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603104-president-greenlights-ordinance-to-hike-ministers-salaries-by-up-to-188' target='_blank'><strong>President greenlights ordinance to hike ministers' salaries by up to 188%</strong></a><br><p>
