<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19232133c3c1f97.jpg?r=232159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015/indian-boycott-of-turkish-coffee-chocolates-and-fashion-grows' target='_blank'><strong>Indian boycott of Turkish coffee, chocolates and fashion grows</strong></a><br><p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers are boycotting Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing amid growing anger at Turkiye’s support for Pakistan in a confrontation with India.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan expressed public solidarity with Pakistan after India conducted military strikes in response to an attack in occupied Kashmir. Cross-border fighting continued for four days before a ceasefire was declared.
 
 

On Monday, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which supplies 13 million mom-and-pop grocery stores, said it was launching an “indefinite and total boycott” of all Turkish-origin goods, which would affect chocolates, wafers, jams, biscuits and skincare products.
Indian fashion websites owned by Walmart-backed Flipkart and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance have removed numerous Turkish apparel brands, according to three sources and a review of their websites.
Flipkart’s fashion website Myntra removed listings of Turkish brands, including Trendyol, known for women’s clothing, street and casual wear brand LC Waikiki and jeans producer Mavi, said one source with direct knowledge.
Myntra removed the brands “in the national interest” without Walmart’s involvement, a second source with direct knowledge said.
Reliance’s fashion website AJIO also removed Turkish brands, including Trendyol, Koton and LC Waikiki, from its app, and many of those listings were shown as out of stock on Monday. A source cited “national sentiments” as a reason.
Flipkart, Reliance Retail and the Turkish brands Trendyol, LC Waikiki, Koton and Mavi did not respond to requests for comment.
India has not ordered companies to boycott Turkiye, and India’s annual $2.7 billion in goods imports from Turkiye are dominated by mineral fuels and precious metals.
But a consumer boycott could still be significant. AICPDF said its ban would affect around 20bn rupees ($234 million) of food products. Apparel imports were worth $81m last year, according to the Trading Economics reference website.
Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, one of India’s biggest apple-growing states, said today he would ask for a ban on apple imports from Turkiye, which were worth around $60m last year.
Moreover, Flipkart last week said it was suspending flight, hotel and holiday package bookings to Turkiye “in solidarity with India’s national interest and sovereignty”.
Indians have been cancelling holidays to Turkiye and New Delhi has cancelled the security clearance of the Turkish-based aviation ground handling firm Celebi.
Reuters reported on Friday that Air India was lobbying Indian officials to disallow rival IndiGo’s leasing tie-up with Turkish Airlines, citing business impact as well as security concerns sparked by Ankara’s support for Pakistan.
US imposes visa bans on Indian travel agents for facilitating illegal migration
Separately, the US State Department said it was imposing visa restrictions on owners and other staff at India-based travel agencies that it says knowingly facilitate illegal migration to the United States.
An unspecified number of unnamed people linked to travel agencies in India were being hit with visa bans under the Immigration and Nationality Act based on information gathered by the US mission to India, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
 
 

Washington often issues visa bans without publishing the names of those targeted.
“We will continue to take steps to impose visa restrictions against owners, executives, and senior officials of travel agencies to cut off alien smuggling networks,” Bruce said, without detailing how the travel agents had facilitated illegal migration.
The move comes amid President Donald Trump’s broad crackdown on migration to the US and efforts to deport undocumented immigrants in the country.
The US embassy in New Delhi has repeatedly posted on its social media sites, warning Indian nationals visiting the country not to overstay their authorised period of stay, warning they will face deportation and a permanent ban from entering for doing so.</p><small>2025-05-19 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1905272202fd50c.jpg?r=052744' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911903/noor-mukadam-case-justice-kakar-observes-victim-mercilessly-murdered-as-sc-hears-zahirs-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam case: Justice Kakar observes victim ‘mercilessly murdered’ as SC hears Zahir’s appeal</strong></a><br><p>Justice Hashim Kakar observed on Monday that Noor Mukadam was “mercilessly murdered” as the Supreme Court took up accused Zahir Jaffer’s appeal against his death sentence.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court was upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty.
Justice Kakar was leading a three-member bench, which included Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared as Zahir’s counsel while Advocate Shah Khawar was present on behalf of Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.
The accused’s lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state. The hearing was adjourned till tomorrow, with both sides’ counsels expected to present their arguments.
 
 

During the previous hearing, Safdar had sought more time from the court to submit Zahir’s medical reports, claiming he was “mentally ill” and the lower courts that sentenced his client had “ignored” this aspect.
Justice Kakar had observed that a hearing was adjourned “only on the death of a lawyer or a judge” and regretted “unnecessary delays” in court cases. Safdar’s request for more time was then approved with the consensus of both sides.
The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case were to be taken up as well. An appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas to be heard.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
The hearing
At the outset of his arguments, Safdar informed the bench that he has submitted Zahir’s medical history from 2013 until now to the court.

He detailed the punishments handed over to his client — death sentence on murder, jail term turned into death penalty on rape and concurrent 10 years in prison for kidnapping.
Safdar contended that only the charge of murder was mentioned in the first information report (FIR) initially, while other offences were included 22 days later.
He claimed there was “no evidence” provided that the site of the crime was the suspect’s residence. Police had previously said that samples collected from a knife, used as a murder weapon, and blood stains matched with the victim.
The lawyer detailed that the incident took place at 10pm and the case was registered at 11:30pm that night, before 12:10am, which he said was the stated time of death in Noor’s post-mortem report conducted the next morning.
Safdar further said that Amjad, a Therapy Works employee injured during the incident, was “made a suspect instead of a witness”.
He added that the police were “depending” on Zahir’s photogrammetry tests and CCTV footage, referring to a video that revealed that Noor had jumped from the first floor of the house and ran towards the main gate to save her life, but found it locked.
At one point, Safdar mentioned a video leak controversy involving former accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik, to which Justice Kakar replied that the lawyer was depending on a verdict by then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa.
The judge remarked that it would be “very difficult to prove literally anything” if one went strictly by parameters.
Barrister Safdar argued that the murder weapon was a “small knife on which the fingerprints of the accused were not even present”. He added that all witnesses, besides Noor’s father, were officials.
 
 

Here, Justice Kakar observed, “There were no eyewitnesses in the case. All evidence is circumstantial.”
Justice Kakar then indicated that the appeal would be decided soon, remarking that a “relief would be given if due”. He remarked, “Judges should bear some pain. It should not be the case that an appeal is taken up for hearing and then the case is not heard again.
“Individuals remain locked up in a death cell for as many as 10 years. This will not happen now.”
The court then gave a break in the proceedings, saying they will resume later in the afternoon after a hearing of the reserved seats case.
When the hearing resumed at around 1:30pm, Safdar contended, “My client’s mental state was not okay when the incident happened. The trial court did not have his mental state properly examined.”
Justice Kakar responded, “You should have filed an application at that time about whatever objections you had.”
Upon Safdar claiming that Zahir was not “medically fit at any stage of his trial”, the bench asked him whether any medical board had been formed to assess the suspect’s mental state.
To this, the lawyer replied, “This is the concern. No medical board was formed at any stage.”
 
 

The sessions court had dismissed the application to form a medical board in January 2022, noting that the concern was not raised in earlier hearings but only when the trial was “going to end very soon”. It had pointed out that the plea was moved without providing Zahir’s medical history and “just to get rid of criminal liability”.
During the hearing, Safdar noted that the evidence referred to the CCTV footage and a digital video recorder, and recalled that Zahir had pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.
Safdar reiterated that the prosecution’s “entire case was based on CCTV footage and DVR”, adding that the post-mortem report made “no mention of the injuries’ sizes”.
At this point, Justice Kakar asked the lawyer, “Are you making an unnatural death controversial?
“A daughter was mercilessly murdered,” the judge observed.
Justice Najafi remarked, “Our system is like this. The parties know everything,” while Justice Ibrahim quipped: “The parties know all facts. The trial is of the judges.”
Justice Kakar noted that Noor’s murder took place “in the presence of six to seven people”. Adding to that, Shaukat’s lawyer Khawar said that the “owner and employees of Therapy Works were made suspects for concealing facts”.
Justice Ibrahim wondered why “three post-mortems were conducted”, at which Safdar said Khawar could answer that.
Khawar said he would need one to one-and-a-half hours to present his arguments, at which Justice Kakar said the bench would only be available for the same duration tomorrow.
The judge suggested alloting 30 minutes to Safdar tomorrow after which Khawar could be heard. Khawar replied, “As you may deem better.”
Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow (Tuesday), with Safdar expected to conclude his arguments and Khawar to present his.
Case history
Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
 
 

In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s appeal, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
Brutal murder
After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.
In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.
 
 

The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.
Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.
Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.
Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.</p><small>2025-05-19 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605245-pakistan-india-agree-to-pull-back-troops-to-peacetime-positions-by-may-30-say-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India agree to pull back troops to peacetime positions by May 30, say officials</strong></a><br><p>

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.
It said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”.
In a second IBO in Bannu district, two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.
It added that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”
The ISPR said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian abetted and prosecuted terrorism perpetrated through their proxies, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it concluded.
In the first Balochistan encounter, troops engaged the terrorists at their location in Awaran district’s general area of Gishkur and killed “Indian-sponsored terrorist Younas” in an intense fire exchange, while two more were injured.
“In another engagement in Turbat City, Kech district, security forces successfully neutralised two Indian-sponsored terrorists; terrorist ring leader Sabr Ullah and terrorist Amjad alias Bichoo,” the ISPR said.
It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in multiple activities against law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.”
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for the successful operations, terming it a positive step and saying they would continue until the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.
“Our resolve to eliminate terrorist elements and defend the country will remain unwavering,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from the presidency.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to security forces for the operations and commended them for their professional expertise and for taking timely action against the “Indian agenda”.
“The Indian conspiracy of putting in danger the life and property of innocent and unarmed citizens in Balochistan by perpetrating terrorism had been exposed,” he added.
PM Shehbaz further said, “We will foil the nefarious designs of India to undermine peace and security in Pakistan.”
Earlier this month, seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the “Indian proxy” terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.
“Nefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, law enforcement agencies and the brave nation of Pakistan,” the ISPR had said.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

A post on his Facebook account said the alleged incident occurred in the district’s Hormuz village in Mir Ali tehsil.
“I have already clearly said on the floor of the KP Assembly that all types of operations and war operations should be kept away from civilian populations, so that the common people, especially innocent women and children, are not harmed,” the post read.
He later told Dawn.com: “We will raise our voice at every forum and make every effort to bring those responsible to justice.”
The minister added that he stood with the affected family and would provide them with all possible assistance. He also ordered an immediate investigation and sought a detailed report from the institutions concerned.
No official statement has been issued at the federal level yet or from provincial authorities.
Meanwhile, locals began a sit-in in the tehsil’s centre with the bodies. All those who died belonged to one family, they said.
Local tribal leaders termed the incident a “government failure” and said that North Waziristan was being targeted once again. They demanded that an impartial commission be formed immediately to investigate the incident, adding that the sit-in would continue until they were satisfied with the investigation.
Former MNA Mohsin Dawar strongly condemned the alleged strike.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl leader Hafiz Hamdullah also expressed regret over the alleged incident and criticised the lack of coverage on the issue.
“The media is silent. The federal government is silent. The KP government is silent. Politicians are silent,” he said in a post on X.

According to the spokesman of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, firefighters from the CDA were called into action after a blaze erupted in the Margalla Hills. He said that more than 70 firefighters were taking part in the operation to control the fire.
District administration officers also reached the site to support the efforts and confirmed that the fire had been brought under control earlier in the day, but it reignited due to dry conditions and wind.
“Efforts are underway again. Our teams are working to bring the situation under control shortly,” the spokesman said.
The fire was lit in a forested area, causing concern among authorities and residents due to the ecological importance of the hills. These hills are part of the Margalla Hills National Park, which hosts a wide range of plant and animal life.
 


CDA’s fire brigade teams moved quickly after receiving alerts from their monitoring units. Teams were deployed from multiple locations to ensure the fire did not spread further. The thick vegetation and uneven terrain, however, made the firefighting task more difficult.
Water tankers, fire extinguishers and manual tools were being used by the teams. Volunteers from local communities and park staff also joined the operation.
The spokesman said that although the fire had been brought under control once, the area needed continuous monitoring. The flames flared up again in the afternoon, and fresh teams were sent to stop them from reaching nearby areas.
Meanwhile, the district administration officers coordinated with the CDA and emergency teams to assess the damage and ensure safety.
The cause of the fire is still being investigated, with initial reports suggesting it may have been triggered by human activity or dry weather.
The CDA asked people visiting the hills to avoid lighting fires or leaving behind materials that could catch fire, such as glass bottles or plastic.
Officials said firefighting operations would continue until the fire was completely extinguished and the area declared safe. Monitoring teams will remain on duty throughout the night and more updates are expected by morning.
CDA teams remain on high alert and further resources will be deployed if required.</p><small>2025-05-19 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605233-sindh-govt-announces-public-holiday-on-may-28' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces public holiday on May 28</strong></a><br><p>

Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement.
“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said.
Taking to his X account on Monday, Biden wrote: “Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.”
 






Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8pc of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease.
Biden’s physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency. He abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against Republican Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats.
President Trump, who has repeatedly berated Biden since taking office in January, expressed sympathy on Sunday for Biden and his wife, Jill, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” he wrote, referring to first lady Melania Trump. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”
Former US president Barack Obama took to his X to offer sympathies and prayed for a “fast and full recovery” for Biden. Obama hoped Biden “will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace”.
 






India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “deeply concerned” and extended his best wishes for a quick and full recovery.
 






Biden’s office said the cancer scored a nine out of 10 on the Gleason score grading system, which is used to help determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU Langone, said a score of nine is “very high risk”, but added that many men can live “five to 10 years and beyond” even with metastatic prostate cancer.
“Over the last decade, there have been many advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer,” he said.
Dr Chris George, the medical director of the cancer programme for the Northwestern Health Network, said prostate cancer is no longer curable once it spreads to the bones, but that there are treatments that can control it.
Biden, Trump oldest to win presidency
Biden was the oldest person to win the US presidency at the time of his election in 2020. Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated vice president Kamala Harris last year.
Some prominent Democrats have recently acknowledged that it was an error to advance Biden as the 2024 nominee, given widespread concerns among voters about his age. Long before the debate last summer, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed a majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Biden was too old to serve a second term.
“It was a mistake for Democrats not to listen to the voters earlier,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, before Biden’s diagnosis was announced.
Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office, making only a handful of public appearances, including an April speech in which he defended the Social Security Administration against Trump’s planned cuts.
He has also defended his legacy in interviews and rejected reporting in two new books that he suffered from cognitive decline during his last year in office.
“They are wrong,” he said earlier this month on ABC‘s “The View,” referring to the books’ authors.
Biden’s diagnosis triggered an outpouring of supportive statements on Sunday from Democrats and Republicans alike.

Ukraine’s intelligence service said it also believed Moscow intended to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile later on Sunday as an attempt to intimidate the West. There was no immediate response from Moscow to the accusation.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, straining to restore ties with Washington after a disastrous February White House visit, met Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Sunday on the sidelines of Pope Leo’s inauguration.
Zelensky said the meeting was “good” and released pictures of Ukrainian and US officials sitting outside at a round table and smiling. Ukrainian media said the meeting lasted 40 minutes.
“I reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to be engaged in real diplomacy and underscored the importance of a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible,” said Zelensky, who also met the new pope.
Ukraine and Russia held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years on Friday, under pressure from Trump to agree to a ceasefire in a war he has pledged to bring to a quick end. The foes agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners each but failed to agree a truce, after Moscow presented conditions that a member of Ukraine’s delegation called “non-starters”.
The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland planned to speak to Trump before the US and Russian presidents speak on Monday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. The four European leaders jointly visited Kyiv last week and have been calling for Trump to back new sanctions on Russia.
Asked if it was time to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that was up to Trump.
“I think we will see what happens when both sides get to the table,” he told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” programme.
“President Trump has made it very clear, that if President Putin does not negotiate in good faith, that the United States will not hesitate to up the Russia sanctions along with our European partners.”
After a night of air alerts, Ukraine’s air force said that as of 8am on Sunday Russia had launched 273 drones at Ukrainian cities, more than the previous record Moscow had set in February on the war’s third anniversary.
‘I could hear the drone’
In the ruins of her family home in the Obukhiv region west of Kyiv, Natalia Piven, 44, recounted how she squeezed into a cellar with her son after an air raid warning, just in time to survive a first wave of drones. They then ran out to a bomb shelter at a kindergarten, before another wave of drones bore down on the village. Their house was completely destroyed.
A 28-year-old woman who lived next door was killed. Ukrainian authorities said three other people were injured, including a four-year-old child.
“I cannot get over it. I simply cannot. I could clearly hear the drone flying right towards my house,” Piven told Reuters.
Trump has shifted US rhetoric from supporting Ukraine towards accepting some of Moscow’s narrative about the war that Putin launched in 2022. But Kyiv and its European allies are working hard to persuade Trump that it is Moscow that is holding up a truce now.
Zelensky has said he would accept Trump’s proposal for an immediate ceasefire of at least 30 days with no conditions. Moscow says it would consider a ceasefire but only if conditions are met, including a halt in arms supplies to Kyiv.
It also says any peace talks must address the “root causes” of the conflict, including its demands that Ukraine cede territory, be disarmed and accept neutral status. Kyiv says that would amount to capitulation and leave it defenceless.</p><small>2025-05-19 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19175346f42567d.jpg?r=181539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911997/uk-strikes-eu-trade-and-defence-reset-in-new-era-for-relations' target='_blank'><strong>UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in ‘new era’ for relations</strong></a><br><p>Britain agreed the most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union since Brexit on Monday after US President Donald Trump’s upending of the global order pushed the two sides to move on from their acrimonious divorce.
Nearly nine years after it voted to leave the bloc, Britain, the second largest defence spender in Europe, will take part in joint procurement projects. The sides also agreed to make it easier for UK food and visitors to reach the EU, and signed a contentious new fishing deal.
Trump’s tariffs, alongside warnings that Europe should do more to protect itself, forced governments around the world to rethink trade, defence and security ties, bringing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer closer to France’s Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders.
Starmer, who backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum, also bet that offering benefits to Britons, such as the use of faster e-gates at EU airports, would drown out the cries of “betrayal” from Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage.
Flanked by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, Starmer said the deal marked “a new era in our relationship”.
Von der Leyen said it sent a message to the world: “At a time of global instability, and when our continent faces the greatest threat it has for generations, we in Europe stick together.”
Britain said the reset with its biggest trading partner would reduce red tape for food and agricultural producers, making food cheaper, improving energy security and adding nearly nine billion pounds ($12.1bn) to the economy by 2040.
It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to an immediate economic boost, it could lift business confidence, drawing much-needed investment.
At the heart of the reset is a defence and security pact that will let Britain be part of any joint procurement and pave the way for British companies, including BAE, Rolls-Royce and Babcoc,k to take part in a 150bn euro ($167bn) programme to rearm Europe.
On fishing, British and EU vessels will have access to each other’s waters for 12 years — removing one of the UK’s strongest hands in any future talks — in return for a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that had prevented small food producers from exporting to Europe.
In return, Britain has agreed to the outline of a limited youth mobility scheme, with the details to be hammered out in future, and it is discussing participation in the Erasmus+ student exchange programme.
The agreement was denounced by Farage and the opposition Conservative Party, which was in power when Britain left the bloc and spent years negotiating the original divorce deal.
Historic Referendum
Britain’s vote to leave the EU in a historic referendum in 2016 revealed a country that was badly divided over everything from migration and sovereignty of power to culture and trade.
It helped trigger one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history, with five prime ministers in office before Starmer arrived last July, and poisoned relations with Brussels.
Polls show a majority of Britons now regret the vote, although they do not want to rejoin. Farage, who campaigned for Brexit for decades, leads opinion polls in Britain, giving Starmer limited room for manoeuvre.
But collaboration between Britain and European powers over Ukraine and Trump has rebuilt trust between the two sides after relations were badly damaged by years of arguments.
Rather than seek a full return to a pillar of the EU, such as the single market, Starmer sought to negotiate better market access in some areas — a move that is often rejected by the EU as “cherry picking” of EU benefits without the obligations of membership.
Removing red tape on food trade required Britain to accept EU oversight on standards, but Starmer will argue that it is worth it to grow the economy and cut food prices. Trade experts said breaking the taboo of EU oversight for something that would benefit small companies and farmers was good politics.
Despite the agreement, Britain’s economy will remain significantly different from before it left the bloc. Brexit cost London’s financial centre thousands of jobs, has weighed on the sector’s output and reduced its tax contributions, studies show.</p><small>2025-05-19 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605201-government-extends-deadline-for-pm-laptop-scheme' target='_blank'><strong>Govt extends deadline for PM laptop scheme</strong></a><br><p>

A press release issued today by the Supreme Court’s public relations officer said a “JCP meeting of the judicial commission was held to consider the nominations for the BHC chief justice’s appointment.
“The Commission, by consensus, has nominated Mr Muhammad Ejaz Swati, Acting Chief
Justice High Court of Balochistan, for his appointment as Chief Justice of the High Court of Balochistan,” the release said.
A circular from the JCP secretary to the prime minister’s principal secretary requested that further action be taken in this regard.
Justice Swati had taken his oath as the acting BHC chief justice on February 14.
According to his profile, Justice Swati was born on June 6, 1963, in Quetta. He completed his primary and secondary education at the Tameer-i-Nau Public School, Quetta, in 1978. He pursued a graduate degree in English from the University of Balochistan and completed his LLB from University Law College Quetta in 1988.
Justice Swati was enrolled as an advocate of the BHC on November 28, 1991, and an advocate of the Supreme Court on April 18, 2007.  He practised law for over 22 years before subordinate courts, the Bthe HC, Federal Shariat Court and the apex court.
He was also appointed as the judge of the anti-terrorism court at Turbat on March 5, 2002, and resigned from the post on October 14, 2003.  He was elevated as an additional judge of the BHC on August 30, 2013, and confirmed as a judge on September 2, 2015.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/191728534d7c9ca.jpg?r=172900' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911991/pro-eu-warsaw-mayor-wins-round-one-of-polish-presidential-vote' target='_blank'><strong>Pro-EU Warsaw mayor wins round one of Polish presidential vote</strong></a><br><p>Pro-EU Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski scored a narrow win in round one of Poland’s presidential election but faces an uphill struggle after right-wing and far-right candidates won a majority of votes, analysts said on Monday.
Trzaskowski, who is backed by the governing centrists, will face nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki in the June 1 run-off vote.
An overall victory for Trzaskowski as head of state would be a boost for the centrist government led by former European Union leader Donald Tusk, which has been at loggerheads with the current nationalist president.
A Nawrocki win would probably extend the political deadlock in the Central European country of 38 million people, which is a member of NATO and the EU.
Analysts predict that fresh parliamentary elections may have to be called.
With all ballots counted, the national election commission said Trzaskowski won 31.36 per cent against 29.54pc for Nawrocki in Sunday’s first round.
The razor-thin margin between the two sets the stage for a fierce electoral campaign in which each will try to woo the supporters of the many third-party candidates.
The far-right showed strong gains, with its two candidates receiving a combined 21.15pc.
“This brings Nawrocki into a favourable position… He will have a larger pool of votes to draw upon,” analyst Piotr Buras said.
That suggests the key to the run-off will be whether the far-right’s supporters decide to cast their ballots for Nawrocki in the second round.
“The campaign in the next two weeks will be very polarising and brutal — a confrontation of two visions of Poland: pro-EU, liberal and progressive versus nationalist, Trumpist and conservative,” said the head of the Warsaw-based ECFR think tank.
Poland’s president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, steers foreign policy and can introduce and veto legislation.
The two run-off candidates have diverging views on abortion and LGBTQ rights.
The election also comes at a fraught moment for Europe as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on and ties with Washington are under strain.
‘De-globalisation’
Turnout was over 67pc, which is high for Poland, though lower than the record turnout of the 2023 general election that brought the centrists to power.
Warsaw voter Iwona Lon said: “We had enormous expectations after that last election and they were dashed a bit.”
“I think it’s a signal for the government that people have lost patience,” the 47-year-old banker told AFP.
Tusk’s administration has been prevented from easing Poland’s stringent abortion laws and introducing other changes by President Andrzej Duda’s power of veto.
The governing coalition is hopeful a Trzaskowski victory would enable it to carry out undelivered campaign pledges.
On Monday, both run-off candidates immediately went for voters’ stomachs.
Trzaskowski handed out sweet rolls while Nawrocki offered doughnuts.
Nawrocki said he was “bursting with energy and optimism” after earlier calling on Slawomir Mentzen’s supporters to back him in the run-off.
Far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur who came in third in the ballot, is a eurosceptic libertarian staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants.
He has accused the country’s one million Ukrainians of taking advantage of Poland.
Trzaskowski said: “I’ll try to persuade all those who voted differently that it is worth casting a ballot for a normal Poland and not a radical Poland.” He added that he would focus “especially on the young generation”.
Young voter Kacper Karwacki said the far-right’s gains in Poland were “very worrisome” but to be expected.
“If you look at countries nearby – Germany, France, Britain – the far-right is gaining ground everywhere, benefitting from social issues,” the 24-year-old student told AFP.
Analyst Marcin Zaborowski said: “Poland is simply part of this trend. That is probably a consequence of new generations coming to vote… People who do not think that you need to fight for democracy.” The fellow at think tank Globsec also ascribed the far-right gains to the de-globalisation promoted by US President Donald Trump.
“The mood overall seems to be that the costs of globalisation are too big.
And people want to go back to what is local, what is familiar,” Zaborowski told AFP.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605196-fo-dismisses-indian-claims-of-shaheen-missiles-usage-in-operation-bunyan-um-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>FO dismisses Indian claims of Shaheen missiles usage in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos</strong></a><br><p>

New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
A day earlier, the Indian army claimed that Pakistan launched a nuclear-capable Shaheen missile at India during the intense shelling, News Arena India reported. A video released by the Indian army allegedly showed the use of the Shaheen missile during the recent crossfire, according to NDTV.
In a statement today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has firmly rejected the unfounded allegations circulating in certain segments of the Indian media, which falsely claim that Pakistan employed the Shaheen missile during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.”
He said that the Indian army deleted the “misleading video” after realising that the claim was “unsubstantiated”.
“Regrettably, some Indian outlets continue to propagate this misinformation,” he added.
The Indian army’s official account remained silent on the matter, “offering neither clarification nor retraction for the erroneous post”, according to the FO spokesperson.
The statement cited analysts, who observed that “such disinformation campaigns” were part of “a deliberate attempt to obscure India’s setbacks in Operation Sindoor”.
“These fabricated stories align with New Delhi’s ongoing efforts to promote a misleading narrative regarding the ceasefire and baseless allegations of so-called ‘nuclear blackmail’ by Pakistan.”
The FO spokesperson said, “Disseminating unverified and inflammatory content not only undermines regional stability but also reflects poorly on the professionalism of official institutions.”
On Sunday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19123149398908e.jpg?r=123210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911962/psx-hits-120000-barrier-to-reach-record-high-in-intraday-trade-before-losing-gains' target='_blank'><strong>PSX hits 120,000 barrier to reach record high in intraday trade before losing gains</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued last week’s renewed momentum and crossed the 120,000-point barrier to reach a record high during intraday trade on Monday before losing its gains to settle a little below.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 636.4 points, or 0.53 per cent, to stand at 120,285.54 points from the previous close of 119,649.14 points at 9:33am.
However, it witnessed fluctuation, dropping to 119,426.44 points at 11:44am, 222.70 points lower than the last close.
The market subsequently closed at 119,689.63 points, 40.49 points higher, or 0.03pc.
After the Pakistan-India ceasefire relieved investors’ worries, the PSX recorded a historic rebound last week as the KSE-100 Index gained 12,474 points to settle at 119,649 on Friday.
The bullish momentum in recent days has been further supported by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) approval of the first review of Pakistan’s loan programme and a climate fund, as well as the disbursement of a $1 billion tranche.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said the market was “consolidating ahead of the budget as participants evaluate the IMF review report”. The federal budget is expected on June 2.
 
 

He advised retail investors to “look past short-term market fluctuations and instead focus on spending less than they earn while consistently investing small amounts each month in line with their risk appetite and long-term goals”.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also noted that the IMF’s “recognition of Pakistan’s achievement in meeting all quantitative performance criteria and most indicative targets is likely to be viewed positively”.
However, he stated, “Investors remain cautious about the IMF’s push for a higher revenue target for the upcoming fiscal year, which the Federal Board of Revenue is also confident of.
“A strong external position, supported by a current account surplus and easing inflation, is expected to revive economic activity and create room for further monetary easing. This should enhance the appeal of equities relative to fixed-income instruments,” Ashraf pointed out.
 
 

Analysts forecast that the KSE-100 Index could reach 165,215 points by December 2025, supported by robust corporate earnings, consistent return on equity in banking stocks, and improved cash flows in the exploration and production and oil marketing sectors.
Falling interest rates and greater macroeconomic stability are also expected to provide tailwinds.</p><small>2025-05-19 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/682a796c82f4b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911908/the-agriculture-sectors-hidden-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>The agriculture sector’s hidden crisis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s agriculture sector is grappling with a deepening crisis, which is likely to worsen in the coming years. The prices of agricultural commodities have been on a consistent downward slide in international markets, and so have they in local markets.
Meanwhile, agricultural input prices in Pakistan continue to rise. This growing imbalance — rising production costs amid government claims of easing inflation, coupled with shrinking farm incomes — raises serious concerns about the long-term viability of farming in the country.
Global food inflation, triggered during the Covid-19 pandemic, is gradually subsiding. A review of the World Bank’s commodities price data over the past three years highlights this downward trend. Maize price, which stood at $319 per metric tonne (MT) in 2022 (annual average), has now dropped to $214 per MT in 2025 (Jan-March average). Similarly, the price of wheat has declined significantly, falling from $430 per MT in 2022 to $258 per MT in 2025.
The coarse variety of rice, which was priced at $524 per MT in 2023 and rose to $557 per MT in 2024, has now decreased to $409 per MT. Cotton has also witnessed a steady decline, dropping from $2.86 per kg in 2022 to $2.09 in 2023, further sliding to $1.91 in 2024, and maintaining this rate in early 2025. However, global sugar prices have remained stable. It was around $0.41 per kg in 2022 and hovering at the same level in early 2025.
But this story does not end with Pakistan’s five major crops. The prices of edible oilseeds have also seen a sharp decline. Likewise, in the horticulture sector, farmers have been forced to sell much of their vegetables at throwaway prices. A recent and glaring example is that of onions and tomatoes, where growers struggled to recover even their production costs.

Despite a global decline in input prices, the cost of agricultural inputs in Pakistan continues to rise, driven largely by heavy taxation, a depreciating rupee, and rampant profiteering by manufacturers

The situation could potentially worsen in the future. The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook (April 2025) projects a 10 per cent drop in global food prices this year, with further reductions likely in 2026, which will bring prices to their lowest level in six years.
Notably, while the prices of major crops are falling, the costs of key agricultural inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, and diesel have also been on a downward trend over the past three years in global markets.
For instance, the price of urea — the most widely used fertiliser — peaked at $925 per MT in April 2022 but has since dropped to $394 per MT. Likewise, the price of diammonium phosphate (DAP) — the second most used fertiliser — has fallen from $938 per MT to $615 MT over the same period. Potash has seen an even more dramatic decline, plunging from $1,202 to $336 per MT. Petroleum prices have also eased, decreasing from $86 per barrel in January 2022 to $61.7 in May 2025. Likewise, pesticide prices have also experienced a downward trend.
Ironically, despite this global decline in input prices, the cost of agricultural inputs in Pakistan has continued to rise. This surge is largely driven by heavy taxation, the depreciation of the Pakistani rupee, and rampant profiteering by manufacturers and suppliers of inputs.
Over the past three years, prices of fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, and tractors have doubled in the country. Meanwhile, electricity tariffs for tubewells have tripled, while diesel prices have surged by 70pc.
The combination of falling crop prices and rising input costs has significantly eroded farmers’ purchasing power. Tractor sales have dropped to just 25,143 units in 2024-25 (July-April), compared to 39,838 units during the same period last year. For context, Pakistan produced 58,880 tractors in 2021-22. This decline is particularly alarming given that the country’s level of farm mechanisation remains extremely low.
Likewise, high prices of DAP have already led to under-application of phosphate fertilisers. As a result, the nitrogen-to-phosphate usage ratio in Pakistan has skewed to 3.8:1, compared to the recommended ratio of 2:1, impacting the crop yields negatively.
Media reports reveal that the government plans to raise the federal excise duty to 10pc on key ingredients of fertilisers in the upcoming budget — at a time when fertiliser prices in Pakistan are already significantly higher than those in India and Bangladesh. Any further increase is likely to reduce fertiliser application even more, undermining both crop productivity and national food security.
In recent years, farmers’ distress driven by falling crop prices and rising production costs has been further compounded by two major challenges: climate change and the widespread sale of substandard seeds and pesticides.
Last year, farmers loudly protested the poor-quality paddy (rice) seed supplied by seed companies, yet no meaningful action was taken by the government. Instead, the blame was conveniently shifted to climate change.
This year, the seed mafia once again inflicted heavy losses — this time on spring maize growers — by selling substandard hybrid seeds that resulted in poor pollination and weak grain-setting. These recurring incidents raise a serious concern about the effectiveness of the government’s seed regulatory framework and the performance of relevant oversight agencies.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s agriculture sector is now characterised by high production costs, low yields, growing vulnerability to climate change, and heavy taxation — particularly after the recent hike in agricultural income tax rates to as high as 45pc. The sector is rapidly losing its competitiveness and inching towards a full-blown crisis, which is likely to have devastating consequences not only for agriculture but also for Pakistan’s largely agri-dependent economy.

The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following last week’s ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.
On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
“Today, Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar
arrived in Beijing on a three-day official visit from 19-21 May 2025. He was received at the airport by senior Chinese officials and the Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Khalil Hashmi,” the Foreign Office announced in a post on X.
 






During the visit, Dar is set to hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.
The visit forms part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China. It also underscores the two countries’ shared commitment to further strengthen the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, the report added.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.
Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reports.
 






The foreign minister said that during the last three weeks, he had two telephonic interactions with FM Wang Yi, who invited him to visit China.
Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.
Referring to his telephonic interactions with his counterparts worldwide, Dar said that they have exposed the Indian blame game against Pakistan, including the attack on any nuclear installation.
The Foreign Office earlier said Dar will undertake an official visit to Beijing to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the FO said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”
It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China.
China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.
Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
Visit reflects Islamabad’s importance attached to developing relations: spokesperson
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said Dar’s visit reflected the importance Pakistan attached to developing bilateral relations.
“China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. The two countries maintain close, high-level exchange and cooperation,” she said during her regular briefing while commenting on Dar’s visit.
The spokesperson said that China stood ready to work with Pakistan to further deliver on the importance of understandings between leaders, enhance strategic communication and deepen exchange and cooperation to advance bilateral relations and accelerate the building of a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.
On the India-Pakistan situation, she said that China had stated its position multiple times and added, “We will continue to maintain communication with both sides and play a constructive role for a comprehensive, lasting ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability.”
In response to a question, Mao Ning said, “I want to tell you that India and Pakistan are both China’s important neighbours. China attaches, all along, great importance to China-India and China-Pakistan relations.”
The Chinese side was committed to the philosophy and principle of good neighbourliness with neighbouring countries, she said.
“We welcome and support the realised ceasefire between the two countries and are ready to play a constructive role in realising a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability,” she added.</p><small>2025-05-19 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1911483648019d2.jpg?r=114850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911964/bcci-denies-reports-of-withdrawal-from-asia-cup-amid-tensions-with-pakistan-indian-media' target='_blank'><strong>BCCI denies reports of withdrawal from Asia Cup amid tensions with Pakistan: Indian media</strong></a><br><p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has denied reports of withdrawal from all Asian Cricket Council (ACC) events amid recent tensions with Pakistan, according to Indian media.
Earlier, The Indian Express, citing sources, reported that the BCCI had informed the ACC about its decision to pull out from the Women’s Emerging Teams Asia Cup in Sri Lanka next month and from the biennial Men’s Asia Cup in September in a bid to “isolate Pakistan cricket.”
“The Indian team can’t play in a tournament that is organised by the ACC whose chief is a Pakistan minister”, the source said, referring to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who was appointed as the new president of the ACC last month. The outlet further quoted the source as saying that the BCCI  was aware that an Asia Cup without India was not a feasible option as many of the sponsors of international cricket events were from India.
The International Cricket Council (ICC), the global governing body for cricket, did not comment on the matter.
Later in the day, however, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia refuted the news, telling Indian outlet ANI, “Such news [is] devoid of any truth as till now. BCCI  has not even discussed or taken any such steps regarding the ensuing ACC events, let alone writing anything to the ACC.
“At this stage, our prime focus is on the ongoing IPL and subsequent England series, both men’s and women’s.”
He continued: “The Asia Cup matter or any other ACC event issue has not come up for discussion at any level, hence any news or report on that is purely speculative and imaginary. It may be said that BCCI, as and when any discussion on any ACC events takes place and any important decision is reached, same will be announced through media.”
India has not played bilateral cricket against Pakistan since 2007 due to tense relations between the countries. Both countries only play each other in international tournaments on neutral grounds.
The political relations between Pakistan and India have led to similar issues in the past. In 2023, a hybrid-model solution was proposed by official Asia Cup host Pakistan after the BCCI refused to tour the neighbouring country to play the tournament.
During the ICC Champions Trophy, India played their matches in Dubai after the country’s government had refused to send its team to Pakistan, the original hosts of the tournament.
Earlier this month, India head coach Gautam Gambhir called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum, including the Asia Cup and ICC events.</p><small>2025-05-19 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19114234109e3eb.jpg?r=115756' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911967/six-killed-in-exchange-of-fire-over-family-feud-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>Six killed in exchange of fire over family feud in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>Six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud on Monday in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Seven people were reported to have been shot in the exchange of fire between two families, six of whom died on the spot.
The deceased have been identified as Fazl Amin, Hazrat Amin, Ahmed, along with three women. Another woman was reported to be critically injured and has been shifted to Lady Reading Hospital.
“The incident took place when a dispute over family issues escalated and members of both families opened indiscriminate fire at each other,” said Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Faizi.
According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Peshawar Noor Jamal who oversees investigations, a first information report (FIR) has been registered, and three have been named as accused. Raids are currently underway to arrest them.
“The sister of one of the accused had died three days ago,” as per the SSP. The accused suspected the aggrieved party of having had a hand in the sister’s death. The two parties were related to each other.
Police and rescue teams arrived at the scene immediately after the incident and cordoned off the area. Security remains on high alert.
Residents expressing regret over the incident, demanded the authorities to arrest the perpetrators and punish them severely.
Earlier this year, six people were killed due to a family feud in the Pehlawanano Pul area of Peshawar. The victims were ambushed while returning from a wedding. In December last year, another blood feud claimed five lives in Peshawar.

Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah told Dawn.com, “The family had consumed Mithai [sweets] with tea at night, after which their condition deteriorated.”
“Three siblings have died after consuming poisonous food. Their mother was in critical condition,” he added.
He said that the family were shifted to the Qazi Hussain Ahmad Medical Complex, where the siblings — 8-year-old Maryam, 6-year-old Hareem and 4-year-old Muhammad Yaman — were pronounced dead.
“The mother is undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Shah continued.
The police lodged an inquiry report on the complaint of Bakht Sher, the children’s father, the spokesperson said, adding that an investigation was underway to ascertain the cause of the deaths.
In April, three children lost their lives while five others were in critical condition after having “poisonous” sweets in Punjab’s Hafizabad district.

An average GDP growth rate of 6.7 per cent from 2014 to 2024 has propelled India’s nominal GDP to a projected $4.2 trillion by 2025, outpacing many global economies, including China’s 6pc growth over the same period.
Strategic partnerships like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a burgeoning tech sector, and a youthful population of 1.36 billion have fuelled ambitions of great-power status.
Yet, this self-assurance has led to diplomatic bristling, notably India’s irritation with US mediation in its recent ceasefire with Pakistan, which The Economist reported as a perceived slight to New Delhi’s sovereignty. More sobering was a recent aerial skirmish, detailed by the Financial Times, where China’s J-10 ‘Dragon’ fighters outmatched India’s Western-supplied aircraft, exposing technological disparities.
A realistic comparison of India and China reveals a stark truth: despite rapid progress, India remains a smaller, less advanced, and regionally focused power, far from matching China’s economic scale, military might, and global influence. Overconfidence risks strategic miscalculations unless tempered by pragmatism.
Economically, the chasm between the two Asian giants is undeniable. China’s nominal GDP, estimated at $19.2tr in 2025, is 4.6 times India’s, while its $32.9tr GDP in purchasing power parity terms is 2.3 times larger than India’s $14.6tr. This gap reflects not just size but industrial dominance. China accounts for 28.4pc of global manufacturing value added, cementing its role as the world’s factory, while India’s 3.3pc share underscores its industrial infancy.

Despite rapid progress, India remains a smaller, less advanced, and regionally focused power, far from matching China’s economic scale, military might, and global influence

In 2023, China’s exports reached $3.5tr, nearly five times India’s $0.78tr, embedding Beijing in global supply chains. India’s higher growth rate offers long-term potential, but its per capita income of $2,730 in 2023 — less than a fifth of China’s $12,670 — signals limited resources for transformative investment. China’s economic head start, built on decades of state-led industrialisation, keeps India trailing, despite New Delhi’s aspirations.
Development metrics further highlight the divide. China’s Human Development Index score of 0.788 ranks it 75th globally, in the ‘high’ category, reflecting superior education, healthcare, and living standards. India’s 0.644, ranking 134th in the ‘medium’ category, is hampered by a poverty rate of approximately 40pc (below $6.85 per day) compared to China’s 17pc.
Infrastructure disparities are stark: China’s 42,000 km high-speed rail network (the world’s largest), contrasts with India’s zero operational kilometres, with projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad line still in development.
India’s youthful demographic, nearly matching China’s 1.43bn, promises future dividends, but without significant investment in skills and industry, this potential remains untapped. China’s advanced infrastructure and higher living standards provide a stronger foundation for economic and military power.
Militarily, India’s ambitions collide with harsh realities. China’s 2023 defence budget of $0.29tr is 3.6 times India’s $81.4bn, funding a 730-ship navy, three aircraft carriers, and around 200 J-36 stealth fighters.
Moreover, the J-10 ‘Dragon’s recent combat debut, as reported by the Financial Times, showcased China’s technological edge over India’s imported Sukhoi Su-30s and Rafales. India’s military, ranked 4th globally by the Global Firepower Index with 1.46 million active personnel and nearly 160 nuclear warheads, is formidable but heavily reliant on foreign suppliers — Russia, France, and the US — for critical systems.
Indigenous efforts like the Tejas fighter face production delays; meanwhile, only 26–30pc of India’s budget goes to modernisation, constrained by 50–60pc allocated to salaries and pensions (23.6pc for pensions in 2025–26, covering 3.4m retirees). China, with approximately 30–40pc on personnel and around 40pc on equipment, prioritises advanced platforms, widening the technological gap.
This technological lag is a critical vulnerability. China’s advancements in artificial intelligence, 5G, and hypersonic weapons, driven by firms like Huawei and state-backed research and development (R&D), position it as a global leader. And while India’s tech sector excels in information technology services, it lags in cutting-edge innovation, with defence R&D consuming less than 5pc of its budget. The J-10 skirmish underscored this disparity, as China’s homegrown systems outperformed India’s imported arsenal.
India’s nuclear arsenal (160 warheads) is less than half of China’s (350), and its missile systems, like Agni and BrahMos, while capable, trail China’s hypersonic and satellite capabilities. Closing this gap requires India to boost domestic R&D and reduce reliance on foreign arms, a goal of initiatives like “Make in India”, but one hampered by budgetary constraints.
Globally, India’s frustration with US intervention in the Pakistan ceasefire, as The Economist noted, reflects a desire for strategic autonomy. Yet, its influence remains regional, focused on countering Pakistan and China in the Indian Ocean. China, a United Nations (UN) Security Council permanent member, shapes global norms through the Belt and Road Initiative and institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. India’s contributions to UN peacekeeping and its Quad role enhance its stature, but it lacks the economic and military clout to rival China’s agenda-setting power.
The ceasefire episode reveals India’s sensitivity to external influence and its limited global leverage, which necessitates partnerships with powers like the US, even if they chafe national pride.
India’s leadership, buoyed by a decade of progress, risks overestimating its capabilities. The 6.7pc growth rate and strategic partnerships have fuelled aspirations, but hubris clouds judgement when confronting China’s superior scale and technology.
The Pakistan ceasefire irritation signals a desire for sovereignty, yet India’s military and technological limitations — evident in the J-10 skirmish — demand pragmatism. India’s $81.4bn defence budget, strained by pensions, cannot match China’s $292bn, nor can its 3.3pc global manufacturing share rival China’s 28.4pc. Globally, India’s regional focus contrasts with China’s expansive influence.
As it stands, India’s economy, military, and global influence are dwarfed by China’s, and incidents like the J-10 skirmish and US mediation underscore its vulnerabilities. Rapid growth is a foundation, not a guarantee, of power. In China’s shadow, India must play a long game, leveraging its potential while acknowledging its limits.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 19th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-19 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/19132613392963f.jpg?r=132623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911939/the-latent-price-for-patriotism' target='_blank'><strong>The latent price for  patriotism</strong></a><br><p>The current tense regional environment likely underpins the government’s proposal, endorsed by its largest coalition partner, the Pakistan Peoples’ Party, to raise the defence budget by 18 per cent for the next fiscal year. The critical question for a resource-constrained country, however, remains: who will pay for it?
Driven by patriotism and deep respect for a military establishment that successfully repelled the strategic ambitions of a hostile neighbour five times its size, most Pakistanis would readily pledge to defend the nation’s sovereignty and support the security apparatus in any way they can. However, is it fair, or economically prudent, to place a greater burden on those already living below poverty line, or to further tax businesses that are essential to job creation and unlocking the country’s vast human potential?
Younus Dagha, former Sindh minister and federal secretary, and current Chairman of the Policy Research and Advisory Council at Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, advocated for prioritising ‘smart defence’ in future investments. He urged the government to mobilise funds for strengthening national security by tapping under-taxed sectors such as agriculture, retail and wholesale.
“Pakistan’s recent victory over India has underscored two critical lessons. First, we cannot afford to neglect our defence needs. Second, outcomes in modern warfare are determined by investment in and training on high-tech platforms. A comprehensive reorganisation of our defence structure must be a priority for decision-makers. Continued investment in smart defence systems is essential, while resources should be reallocated from traditional formations that have become obsolete, as clearly demonstrated by the 40-month Russia-Ukraine stalemate,” he remarked.

An 18pc increase in the defense budget implies a larger share of the national revenues being redirected at the expense of other critical areas

“Imposing additional taxes on existing taxpayers will be counterproductive for the economy,” he cautioned. “Only an economically strong country can defend itself effectively.”
Citing heightened security threats, media reports indicate that the government is actively considering a significant 18pc increase in the defence budget, raising it to over Rs2.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2025-26. The proposed hike is being justified as essential to bolstering national security.
However, the report did not clarify how the government plans to finance the enhanced defence spending. In Pakistan, such increases are typically covered through a mix of government revenue, borrowing and other financial arrangements.
The increased allocation to the ministry of defence from the national budget implies a larger share of government revenues being directed toward military spending, potentially at the expense of other critical areas.
The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has two options: either mobilise funds specifically for defence as a one-time emergency measure outside the regular budget, or it can increase the defence allocation at the expense of other key budgetary heads. These include resource transfers to provinces, the administrative structure comprising federal salaries and civil/military pensions, support for state-owned enterprises and development spending on physical and social infrastructure. All of this would be in addition to interest payments, which remains non-negotiable.
Some senior members of the government’s economic team, when contacted, were either unaware of the latest developments or declined to share details that could clarify how the government intends to balance its finances under the current circumstances.
Given the sensitivity of the subject, most business leaders approached chose to refrain from making public statements. Speaking privately, they unanimously agreed on the need to defend the country effectively and acknowledged that adequate resources must be allocated for this purpose. However, they emphasised the importance of more efficient utilisation of existing funds and urged the government to cut non-essential and unproductive public expenditures. Echoing the views of Younus Dagha, they stressed that if additional resource mobilisation is necessary, whether through tax or non-tax measures, it should target under-taxed sectors, rather than further burdening those already contributing more than their fair share.
Drawing on the practices of successive governments, including the current coalition, some analysts believe that once again, ordinary citizens will be asked to bear the burden in the name of national security. “Elite platforms representing industrial barons, brokers and bankers, are well-organised and highly effective,” observed one analyst.
“They have privileged access to the corridors of power and wield influence through both financial clout and political connections. If they succeed in shielding their own interests, it will be a voiceless majority that ends up paying a disproportionate price for national security,” he added.
A critic of the government’s handling of public welfare pointed to its recent decision not to fully pass on the benefits of declining international oil prices to people, even though they were made to bear the full impact when global prices surged.

On the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan will high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been entrusted to lead the delegation comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani. The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace.
Speaking to Geo News today, Sherry said apart from the military front, diplomacy during conflict is an important front, as India built a false narrative using “fake news”. She said Bilawal has emerged as leader to expose India’s narrative.
She said India is sending seven delegations to different capitals after Pakistan made the announcement. She mentioned there is a rift there as Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had been replaced by his own party for the delegation to Europe.
“Apart from the military victory, Pakistan diplomacy is winning as it remained with the facts and did not allow a strategic drift,” she said.
She said unlike Pakistan, questions are now being raised within India. “A BJP-backed journalist R. Jagannathan has written an article that India is fight on 2.5 fronts — against Pakistan and China, and half front against its own people.”
The PPP senator said the standard diplomacy will continue on the water issues but they should also discuss with climate experts and climatology. She recalled there is no precedent that such treaties are suspended unilaterally and have survived wars.
“You cannot close a river like a tap. In my view, India will start construction on Chenab. Based on their attitude, they [India] will move forward without considering its global impact,” she added.
She said Bilawal will be busy for the next two weeks visiting different world capitals, and then they will focus on water diplomacy. She said the ambassadors in Pakistani missions abroad will have to follow up on Pakistan’s narrative.
She continued that Pakistan should maintain diplomatic relationship with Iran to maintain peace in the province. She said India is a member of BRICS and other global forums, but did not receive any support from them as the ‘security guarantor’ against China.
Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted by the prime minister who requested that the former foreign minister “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in “these challenging times”. The PPP said the committee would also “inform the international community about Indian aggression and its false propaganda”.
In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar left for China a three-day official visit today at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi amid regional tensions, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
During the visit, the foreign minister will hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.
The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.</p><small>2025-05-19 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605150-too-soon-to-speak-of-any-deal-for-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Too soon to speak of any deal for Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>

The new scam surfaced when the Punjab health department detected several ‘faulty entries’ of the dispensation of medicines to the patients in order to show to the chief minister that the hospital was following her order to provide free medicines/care to the poor patients.
An official privy to the development said that the medicines were officially dispensed to the outpatient department (OPD) patients from the hospital’s pharmacy reportedly in violation of the standard healthcare protocols.
He said the consultants at the hospital OPD used to update the prescribed slips on the official portal that was linked to the relevant departments, including the official pharmacy of the teaching institute, from where the free medicine was given to the poor/needy patients.

Protocols violated to ‘show CM that patients were being provided with free medicines’; health dept seeks probe

 
 

According to some official documents, the health authorities brought the matter to the knowledge of the LGH senior management while dispatching several individual cases, showing the grave negligence in dispensation of the medicines to the patients, contrary to those prescribed by the consultants.
It mentioned a case of one Muhammad Shakeel who visited the OPD on April 9. As per the documents, he was prescribed antihypertensives, antidiabetics and antihyperlipidimics by the consultant keeping in view the diagnoses of the disease and uploaded the same on the official portal. However, he was later dispensed three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin), 30 tablet each.
It was declared as a blatant violation of the standard healthcare standards as the medicines prescribed and those dispensed didn’t match each other, forcing the patient to take ‘irrelevant/unnecessary drugs’ which had nothing to do with the disease or the medicines advised by the consultant.
Similarly, a patient, Allah Dita, was advised medication for dysphagia and abdominal pain at the OPD of the LGH.
Committing the same blunder, the hospital dispensed three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, coamoxiclav and clarithromycin), 20 tablets each against the given prescription.
The health authorities pointed out another case of a patient, Muhammad Shahbaz, who was provided by the hospital pharmacy 30 tablets each of four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, Cefixime and Moxifloxacin). Interestingly, his consultant had advised him the drugs, including tamsulosin (used to improve urination in men with an enlarged prostate), tramadol/paracetamol etc.
A patient, Naseem, was prescribed, on April 17, velosef and Danzen DS while the hospital dispensed additionally cefixime (antibiotic), amlodipine, allopurinol and co-amoxiclave (antibiotic), showing how the patients were forced to take unnecessary medicines in ignorance.
“I am directed to inform you that several instances of irregular dispensation of medicines at your hospital have been reported to this department, wherein medications are being dispensed in a manner that does not align with the prescriptions issued by the authorised medical attendant,” reads the official letter of a health department officer sent to the LGH.
He declared that these irregularities had posed a grave and a direct risk to patient safety and effectiveness of treatment. He asked the hospital to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit detailed report and comments along with the fixation of responsibility upon the delinquents, to the health department. The hospital was given three days deadline in this respect.
The health department further issued instructions to the LGH to ensure that all medicine dispensation strictly adhered to prescriptions through the Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), without any alterations.
“Any staff found involved in such practices must be held accountable, and corrective measures must be implemented to prevent recurrence/any untoward event,” reads the official letter.
The official source said that the hospital would have to expand the scope of investigations to find out the exact number of the affected patients and the period as it was feared that the violation was being committed since the last many months.
LGH Medical Superintendent Prof Dr Faryad Hussain confirmed to Dawn about the serious complaints of irregular dispensation of drugs to the patients visiting its OPD, saying that matter had been put on priority in the larger interests of the poor patients.
“We have constituted a high level committee to launch impartial probes to dig out facts with a prime objective of fixing those who committed blatant violations of the standard healthcare protocols,” he said.
Prof Hussain added that OPD Director Dr Adnan Masood would head the committee with strict directions to submit a report during the stipulated time period.

The accused included former Union Council chairman Husnain Ali and district office-bearers of the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat organization: Naseeb Ali, Naseer Ali, Muhammad Manasif, Shujaat Ali, and Amjad Asger. Another accused Muhammad Hasan Ramay died of natural causes during court proceedings.
According to the report, on Dec 8, 2019, Basharat Ahmed, a village lumberdar, and his brother Mubarik Ahmed were shot dead in broad daylight by nine unidentified assailants on motorcycles in village 99A/6-R, Sahiwal. The incident was suspected to be a sectarian killing. The attackers, whose faces were covered, managed to flee the scene.
Farid Town Police registered an FIR against Husnain Ali, Abdul Ghaffar, Naseeb Ali, Naseer Ali, Manasib Ali, Mukhtar Ali, Amjad Ali, Shujat Ali, and two unknown suspects based on a complaint filed by Mubarik’s son, Kamran Tahir. All accused were residents of the same village.
The case remained in court until another incident occurred on September 25, 2021, when the complainant Kamran Tahir, son of Mubarak, was shot dead while returning home on a motorcycle. Once again, Farid Town Police registered a murder case against four unidentified assailants, acting on complaints filed by the victim’s mother, Mubarika Afzal, and Mubarik’s widow, under PPC sections 302 and 34.
The trial for both cases spanned five years. Due to a lack of evidence, the judge acquitted all seven accused.

“Strategically, the battlefield tossup was a clear setback for India. An aspiring diplomatic and economic power, it now finds itself equated with Pakistan, a smaller, weaker country,” the newspaper noted in a report on Sunday.
“The four-day clash reminded the world of India’s powerlessness to resolve 78 years of conflict with the troubled nation next door. Any act of confrontation plays into the hands of Pakistan, where friction with India has long been a lifeblood. Outright military victory is nearly impossible, given the threat from both countries’ nuclear arsenals,” it added.

Drawing on interviews with more than a dozen diplomats, analysts, and officials, the report painted a stark picture of India’s enduring dilemma. “After multiple wars and several failed attempts at solving their disputes, the problem has only grown in complexity,” it added.
 
 

The analysis reinforces Pakis­tan’s position that the Kashmir dispute remains a nuclear flashpoint — one that must be resolved to ensure the safety and prosperity of more than 1.6 billion people in South Asia.
Noting that such clashes only fuel religious extremism in both countries, the newspaper added, “In India, the shift to strongman, Hindu-nationalist rule has left it boxed in whenever tensions rise, as the right-wing base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi often calls for blood.”
Joshua White, a former White House National Security Council official and now a professor at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan was “encouraged by Trump’s references to Kashmir”, viewing them as an opportunity to bring international attention back to the dispute. “India’s strategy,” however, “will be to wait until Trump moves on to other priorities.”
He said the structure of a neutral forum, possibly in the Gulf, “does structurally and historically favour Pakistan, and could make it harder for India to justify this deal to its public.” When asked whether India would accept third-party mediation on Kashmir, White was unequivocal: “No, I do not.”
 
 

Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of several books on Pakistan’s military, expressed cautious optimism. He told Dawn that after “a much-needed pause,” talks could begin “at a neutral site,” allowing both sides to test the waters without appearing to compromise.
Some subtle signals may already be in motion. White pointed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to convene Pakistan’s National Command Authority, describing it as a “soft nuclear” message that might have helped defuse tensions. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s reference to an agreement “to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site” suggests that diplomatic mechanisms are at least under discussion.
Hassan Abbas, of the National Defense University in Washington, emphasised the importance of US intervention. “President Trump’s recent assertion that US intervention prevented a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan underscores his role as a peacemaker in a volatile region,” he told Dawn.
“By facilitating a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, Trump demonstrated effective crisis management and a commitment to global stability.”
 
 

Abbas said Trump’s “balanced approach, avoiding favouritism, marks a departure from previous US policies that were perceived as leaning towards India. This neutrality not only helped de-escalate immediate tensions but also sets a precedent for constructive engagement in the region.”
Comparing Trump’s intervention to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s televised address, Abbas noted: “Modi’s speech felt like a relic from the past, offering a weak defence of India’s policy towards Pakistan. Notably, he overlooked acknowledging the US role — a point that won’t go unnoticed in Washington.”

They said Razaullah Nizamani, 50, was going to work when three armed men, riding a motorbike, fired at him on Phalkara Road and rode away.
He suffered bullet wounds and was rushed to the Matli Healthcare Centre, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. The body was handed over to his family after completion of medico-legal formalities.
The police claimed to have launched an investigation into the murder.
News of his killing spread like wildfire, causing shock and grief among his admirers and casting a sorrowful atmosphere across the Badin district.
Later in the evening, a large number of people attended his funeral prayer held on Phalkara Road.
Nizamani, also known by the alias Saifullah, had long been playing an active role in reformative and welfare activities and propagation of faith.
