In an executive order issued from the White House, Trump said: “I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.
“Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25pc.”
Trump said he determined it “necessary and appropriate” to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India since it was directly or indirectly importing Russian oil.
 






The tariff is set to take effect in three weeks and would be added on top of a separate 25pc tariff entering into force on Thursday. It maintains exemptions for items targeted by separate sector-specific duties such as steel and aluminium, and categories that could be hit such as pharmaceuticals.
The development pays off on Trump’s repeated threats to hike the tariff rate on India for its oil purchases from Russia.
Trump said a day ago he would increase the tariff charged on imports from India from 25pc “very substantially” over the next 24 hours, given India’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
“India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don’t do business with them. So we settled on 25pc but I think I’m going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they’re buying Russian oil,” he had told CNBC in a televised interview.
“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump had said, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India would keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
Trump had made the same threat about substantially raising tariffs a day ago.
Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.
“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.
“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.

The ECP on Tuesday disqualified Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Omar Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Wazir and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week senten­ced over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.
A two-judge PHC bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Farah Jamshed conducted a hearing for Faraz and Gul’s bail applications.
The bench granted them protective bail till August 11 and directed them to appear before the concerned high court by that date and file their appeals.
Faraz and Ayub also submitted writ petitions to the PHC contesting the ECP’s disqualification order.
A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.

Modi will go to China for a summit of the multilateral Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that begins on Augst 31, the government source, with direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 

His trip will come at a time when India’s relationship with the US faces its most serious crisis in years after President Donald Trump imposed the highest tariffs among Asian peers on goods imported from India, and has threatened an unspecified further penalty for New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi’s visit to the Chinese city of Tianjin for the summit of the SCO, a Eurasian political and security grouping that includes Russia, will be his first since June 2018. Subsequently, Sino-Indian ties deteriorated sharply after a military clash along their disputed Himalayan border in 2020.
Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Russia in October that led to a thaw. The giant Asian neighbours are now slowly defusing tensions that have hampered business relations and travel between the two countries.
Trump has threatened to charge an additional 10pc tariff on imports from members — which include India — of the BRICS group of major emerging economies for “aligning themselves with anti-American policies”.
Trump said on Wednesday his administration would decide on the penalty for buying Russian oil after the outcome of US efforts to seek a last-minute breakthrough that would bring about a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.
Trump’s top diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Moscow, two days before the expiry of a deadline the president set for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.
Meanwhile, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia on a scheduled visit and is expected to discuss India’s purchases of Russian oil in the wake of Trump’s pressure on India to stop buying Russian crude, according to another government source, who also did not want to be named.
Doval is likely to address India’s defence cooperation with Russia, including obtaining faster access to pending exports to India of Moscow’s S400 air defence system, and a possible visit by President Vladimir Putin to India.
Doval’s trip will be followed by Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in the weeks to come.
Export impact
US and Indian officials told Reuters a mix of political misjudgement, missed signals and bitterness scuttled trade deal negotiations between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose bilateral trade is worth over $190 billion.
India expects Trump’s crackdown could cost it a competitive advantage in about $64bn worth of goods sent to the US that account for 80pc of its total exports, four separate sources told Reuters, citing an internal government assessment.
However, the relatively low share of exports in India’s $4 trillion economy is expected to limit the direct impact on economic growth.
On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India left its GDP growth forecast for the current April-March financial year unchanged at 6.5pc and held rates steady despite the tariff uncertainties.
India’s government assessment report has assumed a 10pc penalty for buying Russian oil, which would take the total US tariff to 35pc, the sources said.
India’s trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The internal assessment report is the government’s initial estimate and will change as the quantum of tariffs imposed by Trump becomes clear, all four sources said.
India exported goods estimated at around $81bn in 2024 to the U.S.
 


The South Asian nation’s goods exports to the US constituted 2pc of GDP in 2024. Its total goods exports globally were at $443bn in 2024.
 


The proposed tariffs on India’s high-value exports face “erosion of price competitiveness encountering intensified rivalry from countries subject to lower duties”, two sources said, citing the internal assessment.</p><small>2025-08-06 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061722051b539e3.jpg?r=172326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929082/psx-soars-past-record-145000-points-on-strong-corporate-results' target='_blank'><strong>PSX soars past record 145,000 points on ‘strong’ corporate results</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday on “strong” corporate results, soaring past 145,000 points.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.
The market reached an intraday high of 145,187.17 points at 3:29pm, before closing at 145,088.49, gaining 2,051.33 points (1.43pc) from yesterday.
Reacting to the development, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that the “boom in business in the stock exchange is a reflection of investors’ confidence in government policies”.
 






The premier said facilitating business and investment in the country was among the government’s top priorities, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
PM Shehbaz said reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue have “improved the tax system and facilitated the business community”. He asserted that the country’s economy was moving on a steady path to progress.
Speaking on today’s PSX gains, Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “The market rallied on strong corporate results, along with hefty payouts in the banking and fertiliser sectors.
“Moreover, expectation of clearance of circular debt during the next week has rejuvenated interest in companies having exposure in coal-based power plants, distribution companies of oil and gas, and upstream exploration and production companies,” he added.
 
 

The interest in the oil and gas sector follows an agreement between Pakistan and the United States that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also said the market was “up as corporate results are expected to be better”.
A key factor behind the market’s upbeat performance was also the release of Pakistan’s fiscal data for FY25. The government reported a nine-year low fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.
This performance surpassed both the government’s and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of a 5.6pc GDP deficit. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.
India’s central bank holds rates amid US tariff battle
Meanwhile, India’s central bank maintained its key interest rate at 5.50pc as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats to raise tariffs on New Delhi because of Russian oil purchases.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept steady the repurchase rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, after a unanimous vote by a six-member panel.
 
 

Bank governor Sanjay Malhotra said global trade challenges remained but that the “Indian economy holds bright prospects in the changing world order”.
“We have taken decisive and forward-looking measures to support growth,” he said in a statement.
The RBI cut rates for the first time in nearly five years in February and followed up with two other reductions in April and June.
Trump’s announcement on Tuesday to “substantially” hike tariffs on Indian imports because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil has added pressure on India.
Before that threat was made, the existing 1pc US tariff on Indian products was already due to rise to 25pc on Thursday. Malhotra acknowledged that “the uncertainties of tariffs are still evolving” even though “growth is robust”.</p><small>2025-08-06 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06160149f650442.png?r=162455' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929096/musk-versus-modi-inside-the-battle-over-indias-internet-censorship' target='_blank'><strong>Musk versus Modi: Inside the battle over India’s internet censorship</strong></a><br><p>In January, an old post on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, became a concern for police in the Indian city of Satara. Written in 2023, the short message from an account with a few hundred followers described a senior ruling-party politician as “useless”.
“This post and content are likely to create serious communal tension,” Inspector Jitendra Shahane wrote in a content-removal notice marked “Confidential” and addressed to X.
The post, which remains online, is among hundreds cited by X in a lawsuit it filed in March against India’s government, challenging a sweeping crackdown on social media content by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.
Since 2023, India has ramped up efforts to police the internet by allowing many more officials to file takedown orders and to submit them directly to tech firms through a government website launched in October.
X argues India’s actions are illegal and unconstitutional, and that they trample free speech by empowering scores of government agencies and thousands of police to suppress legitimate criticism of public officials.
India contends in court documents that its approach tackles a proliferation of unlawful content and ensures accountability online. It says many tech companies, including Meta and Alphabet’s Google, support its actions. Both companies declined to comment for this story.
 
 

Musk, who calls himself a free-speech absolutist, has clashed with authorities in the United States, Brazil, Australia and elsewhere over compliance and takedown demands.
But as regulators globally weigh free-speech protections against concerns about harmful content, Musk’s case against Modi’s government in the Karnataka High Court targets the entire basis for tightened internet censorship in India, one of X’s biggest user bases.
Musk said in 2023 that the South Asian nation had “more promise than any large country in the world” and that Modi had pushed him to invest there.
This account of the behind-the-scenes battle between the world’s richest person and authorities in the world’s most populous country is based on a Reuters review of 2,500 pages of non-public legal filings and interviews with seven police officers involved in content-removal requests.
It reveals the workings of a takedown system shrouded in secrecy, some Indian officials’ ire over “illegal” material on X, and the broad spectrum of content that police and other agencies have sought to censor.
While the takedown orders include many that sought to counter misinformation, they also encompass directives by Modi’s administration to remove news about a deadly stampede, and demands from state police to scrub cartoons that depicted the prime minister in an unfavourable light or mocked local politicians, the filings show.
X didn’t respond to Reuters’ questions about the case, while India’s IT ministry declined to comment because the matter was before the court. Modi’s office and his home ministry didn’t respond to questions.
There have been no immediate signs of souring personal relations between Musk and Modi, who have enjoyed a warm public rapport. But the showdown comes as the South African-born entrepreneur, whose business empire includes EV maker Tesla and satellite internet provider Starlink, gears up to expand both ventures in India.
Even supporters of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have faced scrutiny of their online musings from police officials newly empowered by the IT ministry to target social media activity.
Koustav Bagchi, a lawyer and BJP member, posted an image on X in March that depicted a rival, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in an astronaut suit. State police issued a takedown notice, citing “risks to public safety and national security”.
 


Bagchi told Reuters the post, which is still online, was “light-hearted” and that he wasn’t aware of the takedown order. The chief minister’s office and state police didn’t respond to Reuters’ queries.
 






Of the earlier 2023 post, Shahane, the Satara police officer, told Reuters he couldn’t recall the takedown order, but said police sometimes proactively ask platforms to block offensive viral content.
‘Censorship portal’
For years, only India’s IT and Information & Broadcasting ministries could order content removal, and only for threats to sovereignty, defense, security, foreign relations, public order, or incitement. Some 99 officials across India could recommend takedowns, but the ministries had the final say.
While that mechanism remains in place, Modi’s IT ministry in 2023 empowered all federal and state agencies and police to issue takedown notices for “any information which is prohibited under any law”. They could do so under existing legal provisions, the ministry said in a directive, citing the need for “effective” content removal.
Companies that fail to comply can lose immunity for user content, making them liable for the same penalties a user might face — which could vary greatly depending on the specific material posted.
Modi’s government went a step further in October 2024. It launched a website called Sahyog — Hindi for collaboration — to “facilitate” the issuance of takedown notices, and asked Indian officials and social media firms to get on board, memos contained in court papers show.
X didn’t join Sahyog, which it has called a “censorship portal”, and sued the government earlier this year, challenging the legal basis for both the new website and the IT ministry’s 2023 directive.
In a June 24 filing, X said some of the blocking orders issued by officials “target content involving satire or criticism of the ruling government, and show a pattern of abuse of authority to suppress free speech”.
Some free-speech advocates have criticised the government’s stricter takedown regime, saying it is designed to stifle dissent.
“Can a claim that some content is unlawful be termed as indeed unlawful merely because the government claims so?” said Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Centre for Applied Ethics.
“The executive branch cannot be both the arbiter of legality of media content, and the issuer of takedown notices.”
 
 

Red dinosaur
Court filings reviewed by Reuters show federal and state agencies ordered X to remove around 1,400 posts or accounts between March 2024 and June 2025.
More than 70 per cent of these removal notices were issued by the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre, which developed the Sahyog website.
The agency is within the home ministry, which is headed by Modi aide Amit Shah, a powerful figure in the ruling BJP.
To counter X in court, India’s government filed a 92-page report drafted by the cybercrime unit to show X is “hosting illegal content”. The unit analysed nearly 300 posts it deemed unlawful, including misinformation, hoaxes, and child sexual-abuse material.
X serves as a vehicle for “spreading hate and division” that threatens social harmony, while “fake news” on the platform has sparked unspecified law-and-order issues, the agency said in the report.
The government’s response to X’s lawsuit highlighted examples of misinformation.
In January, the cybercrime unit asked X to remove three posts containing what officials said were fabricated images that portrayed Shah’s son, International Cricket Council chairman Jay Shah, “in a derogatory manner” alongside a bikini-clad woman.
The posts “dishonour prominent office bearers and VIPs”, the notices said.
Two of those posts remain online. Jay Shah didn’t respond to Reuters queries.
Other directives went beyond targeting fake news. X told the court India’s railways ministry has been issuing orders to censor press reports about matters of public interest.
These included February directives seeking the removal of posts by some media outlets, including two by Adani Group’s NDTV, that contained news coverage of stampede at New Delhi’s biggest railway station that left 18 dead.
The NDTV posts are still online. NDTV didn’t respond to Reuters queries and the railways ministry declined to comment.
In April, police in Chennai asked X to remove many “deeply offensive” and “provocative” posts, including a now-inaccessible cartoon featuring a red dinosaur labelled “inflation”, which portrayed Modi and the chief minister of Tamil Nadu state as struggling to control prices.
The same month, police demanded the removal of another cartoon that mocked the state government’s lack of preparedness for floods by showing a boat with holes.
X told the judge the cartoon was posted in November, and it could not “incite political tensions” several months later, as the Chennai police asserted. The post remains online.
The state government didn’t respond to a request for comment.
When Reuters visited the Chennai cybercrime police station that issued these directives, Deputy Commissioner B. Geetha criticised X for seldom acting on takedown requests.
X does not “fully grasp the cultural sensitivities”, she said. “What may be acceptable in some countries can be considered taboo in India.”</p><small>2025-08-06 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06154423841896c.jpg?r=154641' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929095/pakistan-starts-deporting-registered-afghan-refugees-unhcr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan starts deporting registered Afghan refugees: UNHCR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has started to deport documented Afghan refugees ahead of its deadline for them to leave, according to the United Nations, in a move that could see more than 1 million Afghans expelled from the country.
The country’s decision follows the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
However, the federal government has informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding PoR cards will begin on September 1.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that it had received reports of arrests and expulsions of legally registered Afghans across the country before Pakistan’s September 1 deadline for them to leave.
The UNHCR said that sending the Afghans back in this way was a breach of Pakistan’s international obligations.
“UNHCR is calling on the government to stop the forcible return and adopt a humane approach to ensure voluntary, gradual, and dignified return of Afghans,” it said in a statement.
 






The voluntary return of the documented refugees shall commence forthwith, said a Pakistan’s interior ministry order seen by Reuters. It said the formal deportation process will start after the deadline.
But Qaisar Khan Afridi, a spokesman for the UNHCR, told Reuters on Wednesday that hundreds of legally registered Afghan refugees had already been detained and deported to Afghanistan from August 1 to August 4.
The interior ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for a comment.
More than 1.3 million Afghans hold documentation known as PoR cards, while 750,000 more have another form of registration known as an Afghan Citizen Card.
Many Afghans have been settled in Pakistan since the 1980s, to escape cycles of war in Afghanistan.
“Such massive and hasty return could jeopardise the lives and freedom of Afghan refugees, while also risking instability not only in Afghanistan but across the region,” UNHCR said.
Pakistani authorities have said that Islamabad wants all Afghan nationals to leave, except for those who have valid visas.
The repatriation drive by Pakistan is part of a campaign called the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, launched in late 2023.
 
 

Pakistan has in the past blamed militant attacks and crimes on Afghan citizens, who form the largest migrant group in the country. Afghanistan has rejected the accusations and has termed the repatriations as forced deportation.
In addition to the repatriation from Pakistan, Afghanistan also faces a fresh wave of mass deportations from Iran.
Aid groups worry that the influx risks further destabilising the country.</p><small>2025-08-06 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617582-three-fc-personnel-martyred-in-attack-on-vehicle-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>Three FC personnel martyred in attack on vehicle in KP's Karak</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
Speaking to the media about the project, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan called it a “game changer for Pakistani trade boost”.
He was quoted as saying, “The Pakistan Mart will facilitate Pakistani traders, enabling them to export their products to regions across the world.”
“The initiative is spearheaded by the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and the DP World company of UAE,” the report added.
Last month, trade with the UAE showed an upward trend. Pakistan’s key export items to the UAE include rice, bovine meat, cotton garments, mangoes, and guavas.
Exports increased 1.87 per cent to $2.121 billion in FY25 from $2.082bn last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE had surged 41.15pc, largely due to increased shipments to Dubai. Imports from the UAE rose 25.75pc to $7.958bn in FY25 from $6.328bn a year ago.
Overall, the country’s trade deficit with the Middle East widened by 7.37pc to $13.974bn in FY25 from $13.014bn a year ago, primarily due to a sharp increase in petroleum imports.</p><small>2025-08-06 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06145308b391b8f.jpg?r=150740' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929088/hiroshima-marks-80-years-as-us-russia-nuclear-tensions-rise' target='_blank'><strong>Hiroshima marks 80 years as US-Russia nuclear tensions rise</strong></a><br><p>Japan marked 80 years since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on Wednesday with a ceremony reminding the world of the horrors unleashed, as sabre-rattling between the United States and Russia keeps the nuclear “Doomsday Clock” close to midnight.
A silent prayer was held at 8:15am (4:15am PKT), the moment when US aircraft Enola Gay dropped “Little Boy” over the western Japanese city on August 6, 1945.
On a sweltering morning, hundreds of black-clad officials, students and survivors laid flowers at the memorial cenotaph, with the ruins of a domed building in the background, a stark reminder of the horrors that unfolded.

In a speech, Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui warned of “an accelerating trend toward military buildup around the world”, against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the chaos in the Middle East.
“These developments flagrantly disregard the lessons the international community should have learned from the tragedies of history,” he said.
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said it was Japan’s mission “to take the lead… toward a world without nuclear weapons”.

The final death toll of the Hiroshima attack would hit around 140,000 people, killed not just by the colossal blast and the ball of fire, but also later by the radiation.
Three days after “Little Boy”, on August 9, another atomic bomb killed 74,000 people in Nagasaki. Imperial Japan surrendered on August 15, bringing an end to World War II.
 
 

Today, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million but the attacks live on in the memories of many.
On the eve of the ceremony, people began lining up to pay their respects to the victims in front of the cenotaph.
Before dawn on Wednesday, families who lost loved ones in the attack also came to pray.

Yoshie Yokoyama, 96, who arrived in a wheelchair with her grandson, told reporters that her parents and grandparents were bomb victims.
“My grandfather died soon after the bombing, while my father and mother both died after developing cancer. My parents-in-law also died, so my husband couldn’t see them again when he came back from battlefields after the war.
“People are still suffering,” she added.
Wednesday’s ceremony was set to include a record of around 120 countries and regions including, for the first time, Taiwanese and Palestinian representatives.
The US — which has never formally apologised for the bombings — was represented by its ambassador to Japan. Russia and China were absent.

Nihon Hidankyo, the grassroots organisation that last year won the Nobel Peace Prize, is representing the dwindling number of survivors, known as hibakusha.
As of March, there were 99,130 hibakusha, according to the Japanese health ministry, with the average age of 86.
“I want foreign envoys to visit the peace memorial museum and understand what happened,” the group’s co-chair, Toshiyuki Mimaki, told local media ahead of the commemorations.
Pope Leo XIV said in a statement that “in our time of mounting global tensions and conflicts”, Hiroshima and Nagasaki remained “living reminders of the profound horrors wrought by nuclear weapons”.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that “the very weapons that brought such devastation to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are once again being treated as tools of coercion”.

Younger generation
The attacks remain the only time atomic bombs have been used in wartime.
Kunihiko Sakuma, 80, who survived the blasts as a baby, told AFP he was hopeful that there could eventually be a nuclear-free world.
“The younger generation is working hard for that end,” he said ahead of the ceremony.
But in January, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ “Doomsday Clock” shifted to 89 seconds to midnight, the closest in its 78-year history.
The clock symbolising humanity’s distance from destruction was last moved to 90 seconds to midnight over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Russia and the US account for around 90 per cent of the world’s over 12,000 warheads, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
SIPRI warned in June that “a dangerous new nuclear arms race is emerging at a time when arms control regimes are severely weakened,” with nearly all of the nine nuclear-armed states modernising their arsenals.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump said that he had ordered the deployment of two nuclear submarines following an online spat with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Four security personnel, including a driver, were martyred when unknown assailants attacked a Federal Constabulary (FC) vehicle in the Garagri area of Karak, which the chief minister and governor strongly condemned today.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur directed relevant authorities to arrest those involved in the incident as he expressed condolences to the families of those martyred.
“We salute the security personnel and their families who sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” said a statement from the office of KP CM’s press secretary.
 
 

Governor Faisal Kundi also condemned the attack, saying: “The sacrifice of those martyred in the war against terrorism will not go in vain.”
In a separate incident on Tuesday night, three people died in a gun attack on Peshawar’s Warsak Road, including police inspector Ali Hussain.
Peshawar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Masood Ahmed told Dawn.com that Hussain was travelling in a car with two friends last night when four assailants on two motorbikes opened fire on the car, killing all three.
“A pistol and submachine gun (SMG) were used in the attack,” he added.
“We are investigating the incident, and geofencing work is ongoing as well.”
Kundi condemned the “unfortunate and inhumane” incident as he expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Last month, a police official was martyred in Karak while deployed at a police post in the Koh-i-Maidan area, which borders the Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts. He embraced martyrdom while the assailants fled into the mountains.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061415582e7a2f6.jpg?r=141820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929087/71-dead-86-injured-in-kp-rains-flash-floods-since-june-25' target='_blank'><strong>71 dead, 86 injured in KP rains, flash floods since June 25</strong></a><br><p>At least 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across Khyber Paktunkhwa since the start of the monsoon season in late June, according to the latest figures by KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the latest data provided by KP PDMA, the total death toll from rain-related incidents this monsoon season stands at 71, out of which 40 are children, 17 men and 14 women.
Swat district recorded the highest number of lives lost, at 22, during heavy rains. According to PDMA, most of the deaths occurred due to floods, landslides and infrastructure collapse.
On June 27, 17 people, mostly tourists, went missing after unprecedented flash floods struck areas of Swat and Malakand divisions. 12 bodies were recovered, four people were rescued, and the dead body of one person remains missing, according to PDMA. The delay in rescue efforts sparked outrage across the country.
According to the PDMA report, on July 21, a woman died after drowning in a nullah while two children were swept away and reported dead. The same day, three children died after the roof of their house collapsed in the Bahrain tehsil of Swat.
The total death toll, broken down district-wise, currently stands at: Swat (22), Buner (4), Malakand (5), Charsadda (3), Upper Dir (3), Torghar (2), Mansehra (3), Hangu (2), Khyber (3), Abbotabad (5), Shangla (2), Bajaur (3), Lower Kohistan (2), Lakki Marwat (3), Battagram (2).
Karak, Haripur, Upper Kohistan, Nowshera and Kohat recorded one death each.
The report estimated that a total of 86 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, including 38 men, 15 women and 33 children.
Detailing the infrastructure damage, the report recorded the total number of houses damaged at 358, out of which 54 were destroyed completely. The highest number of houses destroyed was in Swat at 63, followed by 38 in Karak and 22 in Buner.
The number of cattle that perished as a result of the rain was 142.
Meanwhile, PDMA has issued a rainfall alert for KP today, forecasting isolated rainfall and thunderstorms over the next 12 -24 hours in parts of the province, including Chitral, Dir, Swat,  Kalam, Mansehra, Battagram, Abbottabad, Haripur, Swabi, Mardan, Noshwera, Peshawar, Charsada, Kohat, Lakki Marwat, Parachinar, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan.
In a statement issued on Sunday,  KP PDMA directed the district administrations and other relevant organisations to remain on high alert as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast more intermittent to heavy rains, wind, and thunderstorms across KP from August 4 to 7.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06112345b14bbe1.png?r=131119' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929068/missed-signals-lost-deal-how-india-us-trade-talks-collapsed' target='_blank'><strong>Missed signals, lost deal: How India-US trade talks collapsed</strong></a><br><p>After five rounds of trade negotiations, Indian officials were so confident of securing a favourable deal with the United States that they even signalled to the media that tariffs could be capped at 15 per cent.
Indian officials expected US President Donald Trump to announce the deal himself weeks before the August 1 deadline. The announcement never came.
New Delhi is now left with the surprise imposition of a 25pc tariff on Indian goods from Friday, along with unspecified penalties over oil imports from Russia, while Trump has closed larger deals with Japan and the EU, and even offered better terms to arch-rival Pakistan.
Interviews with four Indian government officials and two US government officials revealed previously undisclosed details of the proposed deal and an exclusive account of how negotiations collapsed despite technical agreements on most issues.
The officials on both sides said a mix of political misjudgment, missed signals and bitterness broke down the deal between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose bilateral trade is worth over $190 billion.
The White House, the US Trade Representative office, and India’s Prime Minister’s Office, along with the External Affairs and Commerce ministries, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
India believed that after visits by Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal to Washington and US Vice President JD Vance to Delhi, it had made a series of deal-clinching concessions.
New Delhi was offering zero tariffs on industrial goods that formed about 40pc of US exports to India, two Indian government officials told Reuters.
Despite domestic pressure, India would also gradually lower tariffs on US cars and alcohol with quotas and accede to Washington’s main demand of higher energy and defence imports from the US, the officials said.
“Most differences were resolved after the fifth round in Washington, raising hopes of a breakthrough,” one of the officials said, adding negotiators believed the US would accommodate India’s reluctance on duty-free farm imports and dairy products from the US.
It was a miscalculation. Trump saw the issue differently and wanted more concessions.
“A lot of progress was made on many fronts in India talks, but there was never a deal that we felt good about,” said one White House official. “We never got to what amounted to a full deal — a deal that we were looking for.”
Over-confidence and miscalculation
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited Washington in February, agreed to target a deal by fall 2025, and more than double bilateral trade to $500bn by 2030.
To bridge the $47bn goods trade gap, India pledged to buy up to $25bn in US energy and boost defence imports.
But officials now admit India grew overconfident after Trump talked up a “big” imminent deal, taking it as a signal that a favourable agreement was in hand.
New Delhi then hardened its stance, especially on agriculture and dairy, two highly sensitive areas for the Indian government.
“We are one of the fastest growing economies, and the US can’t ignore a market of 1.4bn,” one Indian official involved in the negotiations said in mid-July.
Negotiators even pushed for relief from the 10pc average US tariff announced in April, plus a rollback of steel, aluminium and auto duties.
Later, India scaled back expectations after the US signed trade deals with key partners including Japan, and the European Union, hoping it could secure a similar 15pc tariff rate with fewer concessions.
That was unacceptable to the White House.
“Trump wanted a headline-grabbing announcement with broader market access, investments and large purchases,” said a Washington-based source familiar with the talks.
An Indian official acknowledged New Delhi wasn’t ready to match what others offered.
South Korea, for example, struck a deal just before Trump’s August 1 deadline, securing a 15pc rate instead of 25pc by offering $350bn in investments, higher energy imports, and concessions on rice and beef.
 

This range plot displays US President Donald Trump’s tariff rates or the most recent previously announced or threatened tariff rates for the US’s top trading partners on Aug. 1, 2025.

Communication breakdown
“At one point, both sides were very close to signing the deal,” said Mark Linscott, a former US Trade Representative who now works for a lobby group that is close to the discussions between the two nations. “The missing component was a direct line of communication between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi.”
A White House official strongly disputed this, noting other deals had been resolved without such intervention. An Indian government official involved in the talks said Modi could not have called, fearing a one-sided conversation with Trump that could put him on the spot.
However, the other three Indian officials said Trump’s repeated remarks about mediating the India-Pakistan conflict further strained negotiations and contributed to Modi not making a final call.
“Trump’s remarks on Pakistan didn’t go down well,” one of them said. “Ideally, India should have acknowledged the US role while making it clear the final call was ours.”
A senior Indian government official blamed the collapse on poor judgment, saying top Indian advisers mishandled the process. “We lacked the diplomatic support needed after the US struck better deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and the EU,” the official said. “We’re now in a crisis that could have been avoided.”
Trump said on Tuesday he would increase the tariff on imports from India from the current rate of 25pc “very substantially” over the next 24 hours and alleged that New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil were “fuelling the war” in Ukraine.
Way forward
Talks are ongoing, with a US delegation expected in Delhi later this month and Indian government officials still believe the deal can be salvaged from here.
“It’s still possible,” one White House official said.
The Indian government is re-examining areas within the farm and dairy sectors where concessions can be made, the fourth official said. On Russian oil, India could reduce some purchases in favour of US supplies if pricing is matched.
“It likely will require direct communication between the prime minister and the president,” said Linscott.
“Pick up the phone. Right now, we are in a lose-lose. But there is real potential for a win-win trade deal.”</p><small>2025-08-06 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061253149747894.jpg?r=125728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929075/dg-ispr-rubbishes-rumours-of-army-chief-becoming-president' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR rubbishes rumours of army chief becoming president</strong></a><br><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.
His statement follows a similar rebuttal by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.
Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told The Economist that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.
The Economist noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May conflict with India. It added that the ruling coalition’s recently acquired two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.
 






The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.
He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
 
 

The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p><small>2025-08-06 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06122102aedc7b0.png?r=122140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929071/planning-minister-stresses-pakistans-interest-in-utilising-chinas-tech-progress-for-evs' target='_blank'><strong>Planning minister stresses Pakistan’s interest in utilising China’s tech progress for EVs</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Wednesday.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to Radio Pakistan.
This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.
 
 

Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.
He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.
Last week, Iqbal met with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.
On Sunday, he met with the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.
 
 

Separately, the government yesterday approved a five-year subsidy scheme for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.
The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p><small>2025-08-06 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06110516daf0917.png?r=113513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929066/indian-army-searches-for-scores-missing-after-deadly-himalayan-flood' target='_blank'><strong>Indian army searches for scores missing after deadly Himalayan flood</strong></a><br><p>The Indian army brought in sniffer dogs, drones and heavy earth-moving equipment on Wednesday to search for scores missing a day after a deadly Himalayan flash flood.
At least four people were killed and around 100 are unaccounted for — including 11 soldiers — after a wall of muddy water and debris tore down a narrow mountain valley, smashing into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state.
“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc, have been moved… to hasten the efforts”, the army said today.
Military helicopters were working to bring in “essential supplies, medicines and (for the) evacuation of the marooned”, it added.
Uttarakhand State Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain, and that rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.
Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-storey apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.
 


Several people could be seen running before being engulfed by the dark waves of debris that uprooted entire buildings.
Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency late on Tuesday that he had reports of “four deaths and around 100 people missing”.
‘Extreme event’
Torrential monsoon rains continue to pour down.
“Residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains”, the army added.
Government weather forecasters said on Wednesday that all major rivers in Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark.
Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.
A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with rescue officials estimating it was 15 metres deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.
Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Expert hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimetres of rain within 24 hours reported in the flood zone “counts as an extreme event”.
Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, said such rain in mountains has a “more concentrated” impact than on flatter lowlands.
“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common, and could be linked to climate change”, he said.</p><small>2025-08-06 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06111114d8e8c40.jpg?r=111125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928939/ttp-agrees-not-to-use-civilians-as-human-shield-in-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>TTP agrees not to use civilians as human shield in Tirah</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.
Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a pullout from Tirah to restore peace.
There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.
 
 

“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.

Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit

The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.
It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.
 
 

The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’
It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.
The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.
Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.
Both the incidents sparked widespread protests among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.
The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.
Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.
The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.

• Move seen as a response to China and Russia’s joint plans to build an automated nuclear station on the Moon by 2035
US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media.
It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface, reports BBC.
According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries “could potentially declare a keep-out zone” on the Moon.
But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon’s surface, with some planning permanent human settlements.
“To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,” US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times.
Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.
The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022, Nasa issued three $5 million contracts to companies to design a reactor.
And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.
Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.
One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging.
“Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,” suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the University of Surrey.
“Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,” he adds.
Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 “given the commitment of enough money”, and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors.
“It’s just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,” he adds, referring to Nasa’s Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon.

The hearing, scheduled for Aug 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents of the India-occupied territory.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked occupied Kashmir’s limited autonomy and brought it directly under federal control.
The move was accompanied by mass arrests and a communications blackout that ran for months as India bolstered its armed forces in the region to contain protests.
The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the India-occupied state’s special status, was challenged by political parties, the local bar association and individual litigants.
In Dec 2023, the Supreme Court upheld removing the occupied territory’s autonomy, but added that it be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”. “We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.

“In case of imposing a major penalty, the principle of natural justice requires that a regular inquiry should be conduc­ted and opportunity of defence as well as personal hearing should be provided to the civil servant,” Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abba­si observed in a six-page order he authored.
Justice Abbasi emphasised that in cases involving public funds, extra caution and due care is required to be obse­rved to prove the charge of embezzlement or misappropriation whereas proper inqu­iry needs to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure that the public funds, so misappropriated, could be retrieved and the civil servant involved in such offence, be punished accordingly.
He was a member of the Justice Musarrat Hilali-led bench that had taken up Malik Muhammad Ramzan’s appeal against the order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, Lahore, issued on Jan 24, 2022.
The controversy concerns the dismissal from service by the District Coordination Officer/District Collector Mianwali who proceeded against Malik Muhammad Ramzan under Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA) on the charges of fraud and embezzlement of funds. Malik Ramzan had allegedly raised the amounts of cheques through forgery after getting them signed by the relevant authorities.

Reinstatement of civil servant ordered, along with fresh inquiry

The petitioner filed departmental ap­­p­eal before departmental authorities, but the appeal was rejected on Nov 11, 2016. He filed a revision petition, which was also rejected on March 2, 2018 and against that order the petitioner preferred an ap­­peal before the tribunal. The tribunal, however, dismissed the plea on Jan 24, 2022. The petitioner finally approached the Su­­p­­reme Court against the tribunal’s order.
Loopholes
The apex court in its judgement held that the allegations of embezzlement/misappropriation of funds by altering the amount in cheques, which were neither authored nor signed by the petitioner, were required to be proved with conclusive evidence by confronting the petitioner with specific details.
However, Justice Aqeel observed, no such exercise appears to have been taken, nor the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner, were sent to any handwriting expert for verification.
The judgement noted that the Investi­gating Officer (IO) and the complainant before the anti-corruption department was the same person i.e. Ghulam Mustafa Sheikh, who was also the author and signatory of the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner.
It appeared that no departmental action was taken against him, therefore, the bias of the IO and the possibility of false implication of the petitioner in the instant matter could not be ruled out, the judgement said.
The Supreme Court regretted that caution and due care had not been taken in the present case and the respondent department failed to even place on record the enquiry proceedings, nor could refer to any concrete material or confidence inspiring evidence against the petitioner.
Moreover, the petitioner was not given any opportunity of being heard whereas, a major penalty of dismissal from service has been imposed upon the petitioner without conducting any regular inquiry.
The apex court held that the judgments passed by the tribunal and the orders of the lower fora were contrary to law and violative of the principles of natural justice as no regular inquiry had been conducted while imposing major penalty of dismissal from service.
Reinstatement ordered
While accepting the appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction to the respondents to reinstate the petitioner into service.
The case, however, was remanded back to the departmental authority to conduct de novo inquiry into the allegations levelled against the petitioner while providing him sufficient opportunity of being heard in terms of Sections 9 and 10 of the PEEDA.
The SC expected that such inquiry would be concluded preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of this order, the judgement said.

• Non-tax revenue up by 68pc
ISLAMABAD: The overall tax-to-GDP ratio increased by a record 3.2 percentage points in fiscal year 2025 to reach 15.7pc — the highest in over two decades.
The record earnings came on the back of heavy taxes imposed by the government to implement strict conditions outlined in the IMF loan programme and last-minute windfalls from non-tax revenue (NTRs).
During FY2024-25, the non-tax revenue grew by 68 per cent against a 26pc growth in tax revenues, indicating the government’s focus remained more on revenue numbers than tax reforms.
According to the fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance on Monday, the tax-to-GDP ratio has hit a 21-year peak of 15.7pc.
The previous high was 18pc in FY04. Since then, the ratio has been faltering between 10 to 15pc, except for 15.5pc and 15.2pc in FY17 and FY18, respectively and then again at 15pc in FY20 — all under IMF monitoring.
The growth of 3.2 percentage points in the overall tax-to-GDP last fiscal year was also the highest single-year increase. The previous record was 2.3pc in FY20 when the then government had imposed massive taxes as part of the IMF loan programme.
Record non-tax revenue
The non-tax revenue collection stood at Rs5.27tr for FY25. It amounted to 4.6pc of GDP, the highest in 16 years. Non-tax revenues include levies like the State Bank profit, markup collection from public sector entities, passport fee, oil and gas royalties, Gas Infrastructure Develop­ment Cess, Petroleum Development Levy, etc.
The non-tax revenue also surpassed the budget target of Rs4.84tr.
The ministry attributed the increase in revenues mainly to 68pc growth in non-tax collection as a consequence of higher collection of SBP profit and PDL.
The MOF had reported petroleum levy collection at Rs1.16tr in the 2026 budget.
However, updated data has now put the figure at Rs1.22tr, showing a windfall of about Rs60bn.
Another Rs108bn windfall came in the shape of markup collection from public sector entities. It was reported to be at Rs150bn in budget documents but finalised at Rs258bn. These windfalls reduced the fiscal deficit to a 9-year low of 5.4pc in FY25, about 1.4pc lower than 6.8pc of FY24.
The primary fiscal surplus — difference between total revenues and expenditures except interest payments — stood at 2.4pc of GDP or Rs6.17tr.
It was the highest since this new indicator was adopted for fiscal monitoring about a decade ago.
The Ministry of Finance had revised the FBR’s final revenue collection to Rs11.74tr against estimates of Rs11.9tr in the 2026 budget and the original target of Rs12.97tr.
This translated into a tax shortfall of Rs1.23tr, the country’s highest ever tax shortfall.
Total expenditure stood at 21.1pc of GDP (or Rs24.16tr), the highest since FY21.
Total federal mark-up payments and debt servicing for FY25 stood at Rs8.89tr, of which Rs7.98tr was for domestic debt servicing and Rs890bn for external debt servicing.
The total primary current expenditures for FY25 were recorded at Rs12.64tr, of which the federal portion amounted to Rs6.81tr, while provincial governments accounted for Rs5.83tr.
In FY25, total development and net lending expenditures was Rs2.97tr, including Rs786bn for the federal PSDP, including Rs2.12tr for provincial development.
The total statistical discrepancies were reported at negative Rs329bn, comprising Rs193bn from the federal government and Rs136bn from the provinces.

Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad’s Sector G-6/1.
The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an absconder in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.
Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to “return to serious dialogue and a dignified solution”.
In a post on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the freezing of the company’s bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town’s operations across the country.

“The situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.
“Trillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,” he claimed.
 






Court proceedings
Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.
He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.
However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town’s chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the £190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.
Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.
Bahria Town’s legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the £190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.
With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.
Auction tomorrow
After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.
According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.
In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town’s Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.
The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.

• KP meeting discusses implementation of repatriation plan
PESHAWAR: The federal government has informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on Sept 1.
The decision follows the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated Aug 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“It has been decided that the voluntary return of PoR cardholders shall commence forthwith, while the formal repatriation and deportation process will take effect from Sept 1, 2025,” the letter said.
Besides, the ministry said that repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, including Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, would continue as per the earlier decision under the IFRP.
 
 

In the letter, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON were instructed to provide databases of PoR cardholders to provincial, divisional and district committees. The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) will facilitate the deregistration of returning Afghans at transit areas and border terminals, with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) supporting repatriation at designated border crossings.
The ministry also directed provincial governments and relevant agencies to map all PoR cardholders and devise action plans for repatriation. It called for designated transit areas for deportees, along with transportation and financial arrangements.
IFRP’s implementation
Meanwhile, a meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Steering Committee (PSC) took place on Monday to discuss the IFRP’s implementation. Acco­rding to the minutes, the committee directed district administrations, police and Special Branch to form teams and hold jirgas with Afghan elders to encourage voluntary repatriation. Additi­onally, deputy commissioners across the provinces were tasked with remapping PoR cardholders.
The PSC decided that Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) should reestablish the Peshawar and Landi Kotal transit points to full operational capacity.
The forum also recommended that the Commissionerate of Afghan Refugees de-notify the refugee camps, as they no longer serve any purpose. It requested the Commissionerate to provide details on registration categories and the number of individuals still residing in the camps.
Regarding local transit points for deportation, the PSC clarified that the relevant deputy commissioner, with military authorities’ advice and Nadra’s guidance, should decide the fate of local deportees. The meeting stressed that these points would only be used for local deportees, with Torkham remaining the primary exit point.
Official sources told Dawn that Pakistani authorities had informed their Afghan counterparts earlier in March this year that PoR cards would not be extended beyond June 30, 2025.
 
 

According to the UNHCR, over 1.3 million Afghans were living in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. Of this, over half (717,945) were in KP, while 326,584 resided in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh, and 43,154 in Islamabad.
In 2004-05, the Pakistani government, with assistance from the UNHCR, issued PoR cards to Afghan refugees, and in 2016, Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC) were introduced through an amendment to the Foreigners Act 1946.
UNHCR voices concern
Meanwhile, UNHCR, in a statement, expressed concern over Pakistan’s intention to forcibly return Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. “Over the past days, UNHCR has received reports of arrests and detention of Afghans across the country, including PoR cardholders,” it said.
The UN agency said it acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s generosity in hosting refugees for over 40 years amid its own challenges. However, given that those holding PoR cards have been recognised as refugees for decades, their forced return is contrary to Pakistan’s long-standing humanitarian approach to this group and would constitute a violation of the principle of non-refoulement.

• Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can’t be settled through amendments to local laws
KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.
He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad’s D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally changed the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash­mir, and Ladakh.
The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.
In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.
The Hindustan Times reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region’s statehood.
The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was “a promise that the government has already made… and it will be done when the time is right”.
However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.
Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: “I’ve heard every possible permutation & combination about what to expect in J&K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow — fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.”
 






Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.
‘Subservient govt’
In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India’s attempt to “usurp Kashmir”.
“India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,” he said, adding that the move was further consolidated by the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which gave “stamp of approval” to the con­troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can’t be settled through amendments in local laws.
In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region’s legislative assembly changed to “influence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir”.
He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.
“All these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.” “This is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,” the foreign minister warned.
