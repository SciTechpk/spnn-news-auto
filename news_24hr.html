Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces.
The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the provincial government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions.

“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body.







The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the UK foreign office added in a statement.

 

Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
“Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
“I was of course certain that it was a murder … but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts,” Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog — the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — over the finding.
“We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin’s inner circle.</p><small>2026-02-14 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141726541cbb3b9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973162/tarar-says-imran-to-be-treated-by-best-eye-specialists-amid-opposition-sit-in-at-parliament-house' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar says Imran to be treated by ‘best’ eye specialists amid opposition sit-in at Parliament House</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Saturday that further medical treatment of PTI founder Imran Khan would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution, while the opposition continued its sit-in at Parliament House over concerns regarding the ex-premier’s health.
In a post on X, he said, “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists.
“A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said.







The remarks came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment.
The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party.
The sit-in started after Friday prayers and continued overnight. Participants in the sit-in are demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be moved to Shifa International Hospital.
The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others.







Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”.
“We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X.
“Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.”
“We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added.
The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health.







In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”.
Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets.







PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House.
“We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”.
“The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed.







TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises.
“On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said.
According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night.
Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in.







PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors.
She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.”
She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye.
Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament.
“Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”.
“Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”.
The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released.
He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked.
Govt told to not escalate situation
Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand.
They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles.
They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled.
Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked.
Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government.
Reporters decry mistreatment
The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises.
A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating.
“Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said.
According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away.
“An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said.
The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.”
It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.”
The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”.
The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”.
KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful
Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful.
“Imran Khan sahib’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X.







He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well.
“Those opposing Imran Khan sahib, who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.”
The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib’s family and party,” Afridi added.
“A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised.







SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema
Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government.
In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC.
“The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted.
Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”.
“The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said.







She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists.
Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!”
“Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”.
“PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded.
“Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.

The development comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Imran after a report submitted by his lawyer, Salman Safdar, revealed that the former prime minister had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye. The court had also directed that he be allowed to speak to his children.
In a post on X on Saturday, Aleema said, “The chief justice of Pakistan had directed that Imran Khan be allowed to speak with his sons. We can confirm that he was able to speak with them for approximately 20 minutes.
“His sons shared that he was extremely happy to hear their voices after such a long time,” she said.







“We are now awaiting his urgent medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad under the supervision of his personal doctors, where specialist doctors must make every possible effort to restore his eyesight,” she said.
“The intentional delay in providing him timely treatment has already caused damage to his eyesight. We cannot and will not tolerate any further delay, and immediate specialist care is essential to prevent any permanent loss of vision,” she said.
It is worth mentioning that Imran’s sons, Kasim and Sulaiman, have repeatedly said over the past year that they have been unable to meet their father since his arrest.
On Thursday, after the report regarding Imran’s vision loss was submitted to the court, Kasim had termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”.
He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added. He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.</p><small>2026-02-14 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650846-karachi-other-parts-of-country-likely-to-receive-rain-from-feb-16-17' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi, other parts of country likely to receive rain from Feb 16-17</strong></a><br><p>

The system, observed using the European Space Agency’s Cheops space telescope, consists of four planets — two rocky and two gaseous — orbiting a relatively small and dim star called a red dwarf about 117 light-years from Earth in the direction of the Lynx constellation.
A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion kilometres.
The star, named LHS 1903, is about 50 per cent as massive and 5pc as luminous as our sun.
The order of the planets is what caught the attention of scientists. The innermost planet is rocky, the next two are gaseous and the fourth one, which current planetary formation theory suggests should be gaseous, instead is rocky.
“The planet-formation paradigm states that planets close to their host star should form small and rocky, with little-to-no gas or ice,” said astronomer Thomas Wilson of the University of Warwick in England, lead author of the study published in the journal Science.
“This is because this environment is too hot to maintain substantial gas or ice, and any atmospheres that do form are likely removed via irradiation from their host star.
“Conversely, planets at larger separations are thought to be built in colder regions with a lot of gas and ice that would create gas-rich worlds with large atmospheres. This system challenges that by giving us a rocky planet outside of gas-rich planets,” Wilson said.
He called it “a system built inside-out”.
In our solar system, the four inner planets are rocky and the four outer planets are gaseous. The rocky dwarf planets like Pluto that orbit beyond the gas planets are much smaller than any of the solar system’s planets.
Astronomers have detected about 6,100 planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets, since the 1990s.
All four in the newly observed system orbit closer to the star than our solar system’s innermost planet, Mercury, orbits the sun. In fact, the outermost planet orbits at only about 40% of the orbital distance between Mercury and the sun.
This is typical for planets orbiting red dwarf stars that are so much less powerful than the sun.
The two rocky planets are categorised as super-Earths, meaning rocky like Earth but two to 10 times more massive.
The two gas planets are categorised as mini-Neptunes, meaning gaseous and smaller than our solar system’s smallest gas planet, Neptune, but larger than Earth.
The researchers suspect that rather than forming all at once in a large disk of gas and dust swirling around their host star, this system’s planets formed sequentially, with gas that otherwise would have made up the atmosphere of the fourth planet being used up by its sibling planets before it coalesced.
Wilson said the fourth planet most likely was a “late bloomer”.
“It formed later than the other planets in a gas-poor environment. There was actually not so much material to build this planet,” Wilson said.
Another possibility is that it was born with a large gas atmosphere that was later lost in a calamity, leaving behind just the rocky planetary core.
“Did (the fourth planet) arrive coincidentally just as the gas ran out? Or did it suffer a collision with another body which stripped its atmosphere away? The latter sounds fanciful until you remember that the Earth-moon system appears to be a product of just such a collision,” astronomer and study co-author Andrew Cameron of the University of St Andrews in Scotland said.
This fourth planet is also interesting because of its potential habitability. Its mass is 5.8 times that of Earth and it is about 60º Celsius.
“A temperature of 60ºC is very similar to the hottest temperature recorded on Earth, 57ºC, so it’s definitely possible that this planet is habitable.
“Future James Webb Space Telescope observations could reveal the conditions of this planet and help us understand how habitable it might be,” Wilson said.</p><small>2026-02-14 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14123932a3cb24a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973171/case-registered-as-death-toll-of-multi-vehicle-crash-on-m9-motorway-rises-to-13' target='_blank'><strong>Case registered as death toll of multi-vehicle crash on M9 motorway rises to 13</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll from a multi-vehicle crash on the M9 Motorway a day earlier rose to 13 on Saturday while police also registered a first information report (FIR) on several charges, including unintentional murder.
The executive director of the trauma centre at Civil Hospital, Dr Mohammed Sabir Memon, told Dawn that six injured people were brought to the facility on Friday evening.
Of them, a six-year-old boy died during treatment, he said. He added that one patient had been discharged while four others were still under treatment, including one in critical condition.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that the 12 other victims all belonged to the same family.
Meanwhile, Gadap police Station House Officer (SHO) Sarfraz Jatoi told Dawn that the police had registered an FIR under sections 320 (unintentional homicide caused by rash or negligent driving) and 337-G (injuries) of the Pakistan Penal Code and relevant sections (3, 4, 5 and 115) of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance on the complaint of Motorway police Sub-Inspector Mushtaq Ahmed.
He said that four vehicles were involved in the accident. He said that the drivers of two vehicles (an oil tanker and a Hilux pickup) were killed on the spot.
He said that the driver of the third vehicle (trailer) was released after an initial probe. However, the driver of the fourth vehicle, a passenger van, managed to escape from the scene.
The officer said that during the initial probe, it emerged that the driver of the tanker was driving rashly.
Initially, the driver of the tanker hit the trailer and the heavy vehicle went out of control, colliding with the Hilux pickup and the bus, which were both travelling in the wrong direction. He said the tanker also had a “fitness issue”.
According to the contents of the FIR, the complainant said that he and other staff rushed to the spot after receiving information about the accident.
He said he saw the drivers of the tanker and the Hilux pickup had died on the spot. During the examination of the damaged vehicles, it transpired that the tanker and the trailer were travelling in the right direction while the passenger van and the Hilux pickup were travelling in the wrong direction.
The complainant quoted witnesses as saying that the passenger van and the Hilux pickup were coming from the wrong direction when they collided with the tanker. He said that prior to this, the tanker had hit the trailer, causing both vehicles to spiral out of control. As per the FIR, the driver of the coach had managed to escape from the spot.
During examination of the damaged vehicles, it transpired that the passenger coach did not have a route permit or a fitness certificate and was also fined in the past, the complainant said.
As per the FIR, during the examination of the tanker, there was no fitness certificate found nor did the driver have a licence.</p><small>2026-02-14 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14190922038afad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973178/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs38bn-ramazan-package-for-121m-deserving-families' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs38bn Ramazan package for 1.21m deserving families</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package which will be disbursed among deserving people across the four provinces as well as the people of Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK).
“Rs38bn will be disbursed through digital bank accounts among 1.21 million families, without discrimination,” said the premier while addressing the ceremony of the PM Ramazan Package 2026.
“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.







The prime minister elaborated that out of the Rs38bn, Rs10bn is reserved for those families already registered with the government’s Kafalat programme.
“This is the biggest effort at the federal level in terms of volume and challenges for the month of Ramazan,” he said, adding that the government, through coordinated efforts, has undertaken a major challenge to ensure that deserving people across the country receive the funds.
PM Shehbaz also assured of a periodical review of the initiative’s progress.
The prime minister thanked international partners for their valuable contribution, interest and concern, saying, “Together we will achieve this landmark.”
At the onset of his address, the premier highlighted loopholes in previous Ramazan packages, including substandard food items and long queues at utility stores, which “compromised the dignity of deserving people,” saying, “It was a painful sight.”
“We ended it last year, and a major commitment was made to transfer cash through a digital system. It was a new initiative to replace the corrupt system and introduce a better one.”
He also shared challenges of the new system, including the willingness of banks to participate, the lack of a fully developed cashless economy in Pakistan, and the challenges encountered by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
“This year, the same experiment is being repeated with better performance and KPIs (key performance indicators),” he said.
This year, the relief amount has been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000 for each family that is not benefiting from other sponsorship programmes. Rs28bn has been reserved for them under the package.
The central bank has also issued a framework for the payment under the system to make the disbursement transparent, speedy and secure.</p><small>2026-02-14 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13201640b0fef21.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972937/think-video-games-are-bad-new-research-says-otherwise' target='_blank'><strong>Think video games are bad? New research says otherwise</strong></a><br><p>Video games are deeply woven into the daily routines of many young people, especially boys and young men. They are social spaces, entertainment, and in some cases, competitive arenas. But they are also divisive.
Parents, educators, and policymakers often worry about screen time, violence, addiction, and social withdrawal. Yet, recent research suggests the story isn’t as simple as “good” or “bad.”
A growing body of scientific evidence, including work cited by researchers at the University of Oxford, points out that playing video games does not inherently harm children and may even carry benefits.

Traditional concerns like aggression and poor academic performance are not consistently supported by solid data when other factors are accounted for. Instead, outcomes vary widely depending on how, why, and how much games are played.

One area researchers highlight is cognitive development. Many games require sustained attention, quick decision-making, pattern recognition and strategic thinking. Some studies show improvements in visual processing and hand-eye coordination among regular players. These aren’t fringe findings — controlled experiments have demonstrated that even short bouts of gaming can enhance certain visual and attentional skills.

This does not mean every game will boost intelligence, but it does challenge the assumption that gaming is always a waste of time.
Social interaction is another misunderstood aspect. Online games often involve teamwork, communication and problem-solving with others. For some kids, especially those who struggle socially in school, games provide a context to build friendships. 
Critics point to “isolation,” but the Oxford research notes that many players maintain real-world relationships through gaming communities. This doesn’t replace in-person interaction, but it does add another layer to social development rather than subtracting from it.
Mental health impacts are more nuanced. Heavy use can correlate with anxiety or depression, but research suggests this is more likely when gaming displaces other aspects of life — sleep, schoolwork, physical activity — rather than because of gaming itself. In other words, it’s the pattern of use that matters more than the games.

The New York Times analysis of national data on boys and young men echoes this complexity. Gaming correlates with better self-reported enjoyment and leisure satisfaction, but it also intersects with real-world issues like education and employment.
For some boys, gaming becomes a refuge from stress or social challenges. That can be adaptive in the short term, but problematic if it becomes avoidance rather than engagement with life responsibilities.
So, what should parents take away from this?
First, context matters. A child who plays games for an hour a day and balances hobbies, school, and sleep is likely to experience very different effects than one who plays compulsively for many hours at the expense of everything else.
Second, not all games are the same. Puzzle, strategy, adventure, and simulation games engage different cognitive skills than fast-paced shooters. What a child plays — and why they choose to play — matters more than simply how much.

Third, gaming isn’t inherently harmful. When monitored and balanced with other activities, it can be a source of enjoyment, social connection, and even cognitive stimulation.
Research is continuing, and there are legitimate concerns around extremes of use. But the evidence suggests that video games are not inherently bad for kids.
Like many activities, they carry potential benefits and risks, and understanding which is which depends on paying attention to patterns of use, not assumptions about screens.

The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.
The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government made a U-turn on its order to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Agha said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.
“We were always ready for the game, whatever the decision.”
Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the United States by 32 runs. India have also won both their matches so far.
“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Agha.
But he warned: “We have to play good cricket to win the match.” The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.
Agha believed spin would dominate, calling Tariq Usman his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.
“Tariq has been bowling well, and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Agha said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Tariq’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.
“He has been cleared twice, so there are no worries.” Agha hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during their three Asia Cup matches in Dubai last year.

 

“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” said Agha.
“It has been the norm in cricket for years, but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”
The winner will be guaranteed their berth in the next Super Eights round.
India have a doubt over explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, who has been suffering from a stomach bug.
“I hope he plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well,” said Agha. “We want to play against the best, good luck to him.”</p><small>2026-02-14 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141457163317941.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973180/imran-bushra-move-ihc-to-suspend-toshakhana-2-sentences-on-medical-legal-grounds' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra move IHC to suspend Toshakhana-2 sentences on medical, legal grounds</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking suspension of their sentences in the Toshakhana-2 (Bulgari jewellery) case, citing grave medical concerns and what their counsel termed legal infirmities in the trial court verdict.
Advocate Salman Akram Raja, along with Barristers Salman Safdar, Gohar Ali Khan, and Qausain Faisal Mufti, filed the petition under Section 426 read with Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898, praying for the release of the petitioners till the final adjudication of their criminal appeal.
The Special Court Central-I judge, on December 20, 2025, convicted the couple, handing down a 10-year simple imprisonment term under Section 409 PPC (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), along with a fine of Rs16.425 million. Additionally, Imran and Bushra were sentenced to seven years’ simple imprisonment under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
The petition contended that the conviction under two separate enactments for the same alleged act violated the principle of double jeopardy enshrined in Section 26 of the General Clauses Act 1897.
“Such dual conviction for the same alleged act is wholly beyond the mandate of law, as the petitioner could, at best, have been convicted under either of the two provisions, but not under both,” the petition argued.
Medical grounds formed a significant part of the suspension plea. Citing proceedings before the Supreme Court on February 10, 2025, wherein the lead counsel for Imran was appointed as amicus curiae, the petition noted that a medical report submitted by Dr Muhammad Arif of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) revealed severe damage to the Imran’s right eye.
According to the report, a blood clot had left the former prime minister with only 15 per cent vision in the affected eye, with treatment not possible within jail premises.
The petition further argued that the trial court erred in holding Imran to be a “public servant” within the meaning of Section 21 PPC, relying upon PLD 2024 SC 102 and Indian Supreme Court precedent. It was contended that elected holders of public office do not qualify as public servants for the purpose of Section 409 PPC.
Challenging the prosecution’s narrative, the petitioners maintained that gifts received from the Toshakhana were duly deposited and retained after payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000, strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy 2018.
The petition also raised objections to the treatment of prosecution witness Sohaib Abbasi as an approver, contending that the mandatory procedure under Section 337 CrPC was not followed.
It was argued that witness Syed Inamullah Shah, being a material participant in the alleged transaction, ought to have been arrayed as an accused rather than examined as a routine prosecution witness, reflecting a “selective approach manifestly demonstrative of mala fide intent”.
The petitioners highlighted that they remained on bail throughout the trial and faithfully complied with all terms and conditions imposed by the trial court.
The accompanying criminal appeal assails the conviction on substantial questions of law and fact, with no likelihood of immediate hearing, necessitating the suspension of sentence to prevent “manifest miscarriage of justice”.
The former PM and his spouse also filed separate petitions for early hearing of £190m corruption case. The registrar office is likely to place this matter before the bench next week.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1414410565f3c55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973179/pm-shehbaz-meets-naqvi-directs-him-to-address-security-situation-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Naqvi, directs him to address security situation in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad in a meeting on Saturday.
A press release by the prime minister’s media wing said that during the meeting, the interior minister briefed the premier on the overall security situation of the country.
“The prime minister was also given a detailed briefing on the current overall situation and security in Islamabad,” it added.
According to the press release, PM Shehbaz directed Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad and other matters “in an effective and efficient manner”.
The statement by the premier’s media wing further said that Naqvi would soon visit Sri Lanka, where he would “convey the prime minister’s special message” to the Sri Lankan president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Islamabad has experienced two major suicide attacks in recent weeks. One occurred on 6 February, when 36 people were killed and over 150 injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers.
The other attack took place in November, when a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area killed 12 people and injured more than 30.
PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari had held a meeting at the Presidency on Thursday to take stock of the political and security situation.
The meeting was also attended by Naqvi, as well as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and other officials.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141242006b23881.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973173/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-poised-to-be-pm-as-jamaat-i-islami-concedes' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman poised to be PM as Jamaat-i-Islami concedes</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.
The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.

Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.
His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.

The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
‘Verdict of the people’
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”.
But a day later, he conceded defeat.
“In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement.
“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.”

Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”.
The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”.
‘Successful’
Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”.
Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.
“It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.
“People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.”

The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.
“With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.”
Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”.
‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“.







The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”.
Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”.
It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”</p><small>2026-02-14 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14130434ef2c121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973174/riverine-areas-of-rahim-yar-khan-rajanpur-cleared-of-dacoits-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Riverine areas of Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur cleared of dacoits: Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks.
“It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas.
Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.”
“In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said.
She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.”
Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation.
She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads.
CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols.
The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh.
She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government.
Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.”
She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.”
“The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.”
The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.”
“It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam.
The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.”
“From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added.
She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation.
Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.”
Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose.
Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.</p><small>2026-02-14 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650785-toshakhana-2-case-imran-khan-seeks-suspension-of-sentence-bail-on-medical-grounds' target='_blank'><strong>Toshakhana-2 case: Imran Khan seeks suspension of sentence, bail on medical grounds</strong></a><br><p>

“The ongoing discussions with the authorities will assess whether the proposed tariff revisions are consistent with these commitments and evaluate their potential impact on macroeconomic stability, including inflation,” it said in its statement.
Pakistan announced a proposed tariff overhaul, which analysts said would lift inflation while easing pressure on industry, as it seeks to meet conditions under its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) as another review of the program approaches.
The EFF is a longer-term IMF loan programme designed to help countries address deep-seated economic weaknesses and medium-term balance-of-payments problems.
Electricity carries significant weight in Pakistan’s consumer price index, making tariff adjustments highly sensitive at a time when inflation, though sharply lower than its near-40% peak in 2023, remains a key political and economic pressure point.
Pakistan’s power sector has long been weighed down by circular debt, a chain of unpaid bills and subsidies that builds up across generation companies, distributors and the government, prompting repeated tariff increases under IMF-backed reforms since 2023.
The accumulation of power sector circular debt has been contained within programme targets, supported by improved performance on recoveries and loss prevention, the Fund added.</p><small>2026-02-14 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14115359f3e41f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973169/punjab-ctd-claims-arrest-of-26-suspected-terrorists-over-past-month' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD claims arrest of 26 suspected terrorists over past month</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) claimed on Saturday to have arrested 26 suspected terrorists belonging to various proscribed organisations during intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted across the province over the past month.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the department carried out 286 IBOs in different districts in view of potential terrorism threats. These operations were conducted in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sahiwal, Khushab, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Faisalabad, Jhang, Chakwal, Rajanpur, Narowal, Pakpattan and Sargodha.
During the operations, 286 suspects were interrogated, and 26 terrorists were taken into custody along with arms, explosives and other prohibited material.
One alleged militant affiliated with Al-Qaeda was arrested in Lahore, while four members of Fitna al-Khawarij were apprehended in Sargodha. Officials said the arrested suspects had links with the tribal areas.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

 

The spokesperson said 4.9 kilograms of explosives, three improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 19 detonators, 34 feet of safety fuse wire, pamphlets and magazines of banned organisations, Prima cards, mobile phones and cash were recovered from their possession.
Authorities said the suspects were planning to target important buildings in different cities to spread fear among the public.
The CTD registered 25 cases against the arrested suspects under terrorism charges and started the investigation.
In addition to the IBOs, the department, in coordination with local police and security agencies, conducted 4,662 combing operations across the province. During these operations, 160,009 individuals were checked, 538 suspects were arrested, 516 first information reports (FIRs) were registered and 389 recoveries were made.
Last month, the CTD claimed to have arrested 49 suspected terrorists and foiled a major terror plan during a province-wide crackdown in Punjab, including a “dangerous operative” allegedly linked to India’s intelligence agency (RAW).
The same month, it killed six ‘highly dangerous’ terrorists during an intelligence-based operation near Chapri Dam.</p><small>2026-02-14 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650764-imran-khans-vision-opposition-sit-in-at-parliament-house-enters-second-day' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's vision: Opposition sit-in at Parliament House enters second day</strong></a><br><p>

Trump’s military moves and tough talk come even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”
He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people.”
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
“In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”







Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the “dust.” He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.”
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.”
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.

According to police, the accident took place on the track near Jamgarh mid-point. ASI Muhammad Bashir Ahmed Joyia, who was performing security duty, was killed when he was hit by the jeep of racer Faisal Shadikhel. 
The reports alleged that Shadikhel lost control of his vehicle that skidded off the track and ran over ASI Joiya while other officials saved their lives by reacting promptly and getting away from the path of the coming vehicle. ASI Bashir, who died on the spot, was posted at Shahr Farid Police Station. 
After the accident, the police booked Shadikhel for the killing of ASI Joiya.
Shadikhel was the unofficial winner of the first round of prepared category participants’ race on Friday. His win is considered a major upset as he was third in Thursday’s qualifying round of the prepared category.
Marrot Police Station near Jamgarh Fort in whose limits the accident took place registered a case on FIR No 46/26 under Section 322 (manslaughter) and Section 379 (theft) of the PPC on the complaint of SI Riaz Shahid.
The complainant alleged that Shadikhel committed alleged negligence on a turn that led to the accident. 
Meanwhile, according to unofficial reports, Shadikhel covered 236km in 1:43 hours and became a winner. He was followed by Mir Jaffar Magsi and Hussain Asif, in second and third positions, respectively.
Magsi was in second position in Thursday’s qualifying round. The prepared category participants’ second and final round would be held on Sunday (tomorrow), the last day of the rally.

Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta, 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot.
He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29.
According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav, who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large.

The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan.
Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman.
Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place.
In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice.
An FBI official described the case as an example of “transnational repression”.
The case comes amid wider tensions between India and Western governments over alleged threats against Sikh separatists abroad.
Canada has separately accused India of involvement in the 2023 killing of another Sikh leader outside a temple in British Columbia — allegations New Delhi has denied.
Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and later extradited to the United States.</p><small>2026-02-14 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650758-death-toll-rises-to-14-in-m9-motorway-crash-as-victims-succumb-to-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll rises to 14 in M9 Motorway crash as victims succumb to injuries</strong></a><br><p>

Washington Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded at approximately 3:33am on Wednesday to a report of smoke in a hallway in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue NW. Firefighters entered an apartment, extinguished a small fire, and found an adult male unconscious and not breathing.
The victim was later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as 40-year-old Syed Hammad Hussain. Officials said he showed signs of blunt-force trauma as well as thermal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene after responders found no signs consistent with life.
The apartment is located near Logan Circle, a busy residential area about 1.1 miles northwest of the White House.
In an official statement issued on Friday, police said that following an initial assessment, the matter was referred to police and taken over by homicide detectives. As of Friday, no suspects had been identified.
Investigators are reviewing security camera footage from a neighbouring building. Sources familiar with the investigation told local media the footage shows Hussain entering the building with three other individuals, including a possible woman, shortly before the fire. The same individuals were later seen running from the building.
Authorities have appealed to the public for information and urged anyone with knowledge of the incident to contact police. The Metropolitan Police Department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
The Hussain family is from Lahore and is settled in Washington.  The funeral prayer service for Hammad Hussain is scheduled for 12:30pm on Saturday at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia.</p><small>2026-02-14 03:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14082244d032716.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973083/soes-drain-rs21tr-of-tax-revenue-in-fy25' target='_blank'><strong>SOEs drain Rs2.1tr of tax revenue in FY25</strong></a><br><p>• Finance ministry report says aggregate profits decline 13pc to Rs709.9bn• Power sector’s Rs9.2tr debt crisis deepens despite Rs800bn capital injection
ISLAMABAD: Sitting on mammoth liabilities of Rs9.2 trillion — equivalent to half of Pakistan’s annual budget — and facing ever-rising losses and negative equity, the power sector leadership remains clueless about its business operations as a going concern and the consequential challenge to the state.
This damning charge sheet has been issued by the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance in its FY25 aggregate report on the performance of State-Owned Entities, as required by the IMF, posing a serious question mark on the credibility of power sector planning.
This is despite the fact that the power sector remains the top recipient of equity injections, while continuously bleeding the economy and consumers at large. National Highway Authority (NHA) comes as the second biggest financial black hole after the power sector.
Worst still, the business plans submitted by power sector distribution companies (Discos) tend to be descriptive rather than analytical. These plans often list intended activities, such as improving recoveries or reducing losses, but fail to model the financial impact of these interventions.
“The absence of clear financial causality undermines the credibility and effectiveness of these plans,” the CMU observed in its report released on Friday with the approval of the federal government as required under the IMF programme.
The report noted over Rs2tr of unfunded liabilities of all federal SOEs, including more than Rs1.5tr of unfunded pension liabilities in the power sector alone, in addition to around Rs1.9tr circular debt, despite around Rs800bn capital injection during FY2025.
Not only the Discos but generation companies (Gencos) typically present outdated and defensive business plans, focused on preserving existing capacity rather than optimising the asset portfolio. There is a notable lack of cost-benefit analysis of refurbishment versus decommissioning, as well as little evaluation of asset-disposal or privatisation options. Consequently, capital remains tied up in low-yield assets.
A recurring theme in Gencos plans is the sunk cost fallacy — the notion that prior investments justify continued capital expenditure. However, in a reform-oriented context, sunk costs should be viewed as historical facts, not as valid grounds for further investment. “Without rationalisation modelling, capital continues to be misallocated”, the report observed.
The report said the Discos’ plans frequently omit essential financial planning elements, such as capital prioritisation, sequencing investments aimed at loss reduction, and modelling of returns on investment. There is little consideration of indicators such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), or leverage.
“As a result, these plans lack the rigor needed to serve as tangible restructuring roadmaps and instead remain mere wish lists”, the report said pointing out “a broader challenge of Discos following an activity-based planning approach — plan, spend, and hope for positive outcomes — rather than a value-based approach that emphasises modelling, prioritisation, and strategic allocation based on return on investment”.
Overall, the CMU reported that fiscal support to SOEs increased by 37pc to Rs2.079tr in FY25, compared with the previous year’s Rs1.513tr. The expansion of fiscal support was driven by significant changes across various components, including equity injections totalling Rs729bn, led by a one-off circular debt payment.
Government loans to SOEs also grew, climbing by 34pc from Rs263.3bn to Rs354.1bn, underscoring the government’s ongoing commitment to providing direct financial resources to support SOE operations and restructuring.
In contrast to increases in guarantees, loans, and equity, both grants and subsidies declined. Grants fell by 27pc to Rs269.2bn, while subsidies dropped by 7pc, reaching Rs726.3bn. These reductions “reflect shifting government priorities or improved operational efficiencies in certain areas”.

 

Sovereign guarantees increased markedly, from Rs1.412tr in FY24 to Rs2.164tr in FY25, reflecting a 52pc rise. This change is not due to the addition of new guarantees, but rather accounting for self-liquidating guarantees on stock.
During FY25, SOEs experienced a decline in their overall profitability. Aggregate profits decreased by 13pc, falling from Rs820.7bn in FY24 to Rs709.9bn in FY25. This downward adjustment was primarily attributed to reduced financial contributions from profit-making SOEs in the oil sector, a consequence of declining international oil prices.
On the loss side, there was a slight improvement, with cumulative losses across SOEs declining by 2pc to Rs833bn in FY25 against Rs851.4bn in the previous fiscal year. “The net result of these changes in profits and losses was a total net adjusted loss of Rs122.9bn for FY25 from Rs30.6bn in FY24”, it said, putting the NHA at the top with Rs295bn loss and over Rs315bn power sector loss.
Total SOEs equity increased by 7pc, rising from Rs5.865tr in FY24 to Rs6.246tr in FY25, but this growth was primarily driven by recapitalisation efforts and significant equity injections, particularly in the power sector, to clear the circular debt stock.
On the liabilities side, there was a moderate improvement, as total liabilities decreased by 3pc to Rs31.742tr in FY25 from Rs32.57tr. Total assets value remained largely unchanged, exhibiting only a marginal decrease of 1pc to Rs37.988tr from Rs38,44tr a year earlier.
During the year, the federal government collected Rs12.97tr in tax revenue, of which approximately Rs2.1tr (about 16pc) was channelled back to SOEs through subsidies, equity injections, grants, and loans. In practical terms, every Rs6 collected in taxes results in Re1 being absorbed by SOEs.
The SOEs’ debt stock, circular debt, pensions and quasi-fiscal flows showed that total debt portfolio rose by 4pc, increasing from Rs9.196tr to Rs9.571tr, reflecting a clear re-profiling of the funding architecture among SOEs. Cash Development Loans saw a significant expansion, up 21pc to Rs2146tr. Similarly, Foreign Re-Lent exposure increased by 24pc to Rs2.16tr.
“These changes confirm a shift toward sovereign-intermediate financing, in which the federal government assumes the credit risk and SOEs act as pass-through borrowers”, the report deplored. Bank borrowing remained nearly unchanged at Rs2.8tr, suggesting a credit-saturated environment and sector-wide tightening of exposure limits.
Contributing factors include elevated leverage, a deterioration in debt service coverage, and higher expected losses. Unfunded pensions stand at Rs2.03tr, including Rs1.5tr in the power sector, and excluding the pensions of Pakistan Railways, which reports pensions on a cash basis annually rather than on aggregate pension unfunded obligations.
Statutory compliance standards were found to be weak and uneven across SOEs, with approximately 36pc of SOEs having finalised audited financial statements as of the reporting cutoff. This constrains the timeliness of performance analysis, valuation assessments, and comprehensive fiscal-risk evaluation.
The CMU called for continued strengthening in these areas — including board composition, audit timeliness, disclosure quality, and performance-linked accountability — which would support greater strategic discipline and help SOEs progress toward sustained value creation for the state.

Kathryn Ruemmler

• DP World CEO Bin Sulayem ousted as investors stop funding over ties to disgraced financier• Goldman Sachs lawyer Ruemmler resigns due to her extensive ties to Epstein in documents• PM urges probe into top Norwegians’ links to dead felon
DUBAI: The chairman and chief executive of DP World Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem’s resigned on Friday following pressure over his alleged ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, making him one of the highest-profile figures to step down after the recent release of documents.
The fallout also prompted the resignation of a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and has sparked official inquiries into political and royal figures in Norway.
Bin Sulayem’s departure from the Dubai-based logistics giant was announced the same day the emirate’s ruler appointed a new chairman for the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, another role Bin Sulayem held.
Pressure mounted on the state-owned firm after two major investors, the UK development finance agency British International Investment and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, said this week they would suspend new investments with DP World over the matter.
Both organisations welcomed the resignation. The UK agency said it looked forward to continuing “our partnership to advance the development of key African trading ports”. In a statement, La Caisse said “the company took the appropriate measures” and it would “move quickly to work with DP World’s new leadership”.
DP World appointed Essa Kazim as the new chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, the Dubai Media Office reported. Kazim is the governor of the Dubai International Financial Centre, while Narayan was the company’s deputy CEO.
The documents, released by the US Department of Justice, revealed frequent correspondence between Bin Sulayem and Epstein for more than a decade after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
The correspondence allegedly includes business discussions, plans for Bin Sulayem to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island, and exchanges of an intimate nature. While being named is not evidence of wrongdoing, the contents prompted immediate scrutiny.


Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem

US Rep. Thomas Massie, who reviewed unredacted files, referenced the resignation in a post on X on Friday.
“DOJ red­acted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”







Bin Sulayem was a key architect of Dubai’s transformation, having established the developer behind the emirate’s palm-shaped islands and helping build DP World into one of the world’s largest port operators.
Top lawyer resigns
The repercussions also rea­ched Wall Street, where Gold­man Sachs’ general counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, anno­unced she will resign at the end of June.
The decision followed the release of emails showing her extensive relationship with Epstein long after his conviction.
The interactions reportedly included career advice, questioning of his sex crimes, and personal messages where Ruemmler called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey.”
Before joining Goldman Sachs in 2020, Ruemmler held senior roles at the Department of Justice and served as a legal advisor in the White House under then-President Barack Obama.
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he accepted her decision.
‘Shocking connection’
Meanwhile, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Friday it was crucial to fully investigate the relationships between prominent Norwegians and Epstein.
“I think it has been quite shocking for people to get this insight into this world and the connection between people with power. And how it has affected people without power, who have been abused and subjected to assault,” Stoere told public broadcaster NRK. “As prime minister, I have a responsibility to speak clearly about this.”

AMMAN: More than a week after he walked away from Human Rights Watch over its blocking of a report on Palestinians’ right of return, the organisation’s former country director says he is still fuming over the lack of a transparent explanation.
Omar Shakir, ex-HRW Israel and Palestine director, resigned in February after the executive director withdrew a report on Palestinian return rights before its December release.
“The report finds that Israeli authorities’ longstanding policy denying Palestinian refugees the right of return, a fundamental right well-established in law, has caused serious harm and amounts to a crime against humanity,” Shakir told AFP in Amman.
Shakir, who resigned alongside his research colleague Milena Ansari, said the organisation has not provided a written reason for pulling the report. When the story became public, Shakir said, HRW stated the report had been “paused to give them more time to conduct additional factual and legal analysis”.
Meanwhile, HRW told AFP the report’s release was delayed due to its complexity. Their review revealed the need for stronger research to meet standards, leading to a pause for further analysis, which is ongoing.
Shakir believes the decision was due to political backlash, as HRW’s new leadership worried the report might be perceived as a call to eliminate Israel’s Jewish identity.
“So, ultimately, this was not about the law or the facts,” he said. “This was a decision motivated by concerns of how the organisation would be received when issuing this report.
The “right of return” is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dating back to the 1948 war. Approximately 760,000 Palestinians were displaced in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, with descendants now numbering six million according to the UN. Israel sees this demand as a threat to its Jewish identity.
Smear campaign
Meanwhile, a UN human rights spokesperson on Friday expressed concern about attacks on independent UN experts after several European governments criticised Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for Palestine, and called for her resignation.
“We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing.
The Czech Republic’s Foreign Minister Petr Macinka on Friday quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a “common enemy of humanity”, and he also called for her resignation.
Subsequently, Germany, France, and Italy criticised Albanese this week for remarks against Israel, accusations she refutes.
Albanese’s February 7 remarks in Doha did not label Israel as such although she has regularly criticised its actions in the Gaza conflict, Reuters confirmed.
Albanese said on X: “Three European governments accuse me — based on statements I never made — with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days.” She was citing figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000.







Though unprecedented, it’s theoretically possible to introduce a motion to dismiss a special rapporteur, however, diplomats said strong support for Palestinian rights within the UN Human Rights Council means such a motion is unlikely to pass.

Talking to a select group of media persons in the federal capital, he said that Iran was countering the “Zionist and Western narrative” alongside military aggression, adding that the US and Israel had a history of “deception and backstabbing”.
“But they have seen the response in the recent 12-day conflict, and Israel was almost on its knees when the US intervened,” the envoy said. He added that wars were not fought merely with weapons but with national determination and the resilience of the whole society.
He said that the West had used all its cards in the June 2025 attack by the Zionist regime and the recent conspiracy when riots were held, and acknowledged that the resistance movements in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria had been weakened.

Moghadam urges Muslim unity, lauds Islamabad’s support for Tehran during 12-day war with Israel

“While there are ups and downs in wars and broader conflicts, the US, Israel and others have seen the advanced military capabilities as well as the strength of the Iranian nation — it is less likely there will be a war soon,” Mr Moghadam said.
‘War may affect region’
“If, God forbid, war breaks out, regional countries will have to make their own decisions, as such a war would affect the entire region,” he added.
He stressed that Iran had always called for greater unity and cooperation among Muslim countries since the Islamic revolution.
He said that all the Muslim nations were targets on their list but the priority was different. “Today it is Iran and tomorrow it will be Saudi Arabia,” he added.
Referring to the “12-day war” with Israel last year, he lauded Pakistan for supporting Iran and said that despite strong propaganda and huge networks, the Western narrative had weakened over the decades and resistance to the policies of Zionism was visible globally.
He also lauded Pakistan’s stance at regional and international forums, claiming Islamabad had supported Iran diplomatically during the recent conflict. “There is a clear understanding in Pakistan that any harm to Iran is harm to Pakistan,” he added.
The ambassador said that US President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan for Gaza was a mockery, as all the funding for the restructuring of the Palestinian territory would be in the hands of the American president, “who has no credibility”.
“Whereas the establishment of the [international stabilisation]force [for Gaza] was a dangerous move as its target was to disarm the resistance group Hamas through Muslim countries,” he added. “Pak­istan’s decision to distance itself from this force is encouraging.”
Balochistan
Speaking on common issues, he expressed concern over terrorism in Balochistan province and said that it was a bilateral matter between the two countries.
He observed that there was a need to look into the root causes of the problems faced by Pakistan’s Balochistan province and Iran’s adjoining Sistan province. He said that militant activities could not be countered through the use of force alone.
“Lack of opportunities and discontent among the people of Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan provinces has to be addressed through economic development and cooperation to neutralise the hostile designs of the common enemies of both countries,” he added.
Women empowerment
Responding to a question on the status of women in Iran, the envoy said that while Iran had laws regarding the hijab, there was no coercion in public spaces, and women continued to play a prominent role in education and professional sectors.
He said that recent rallies on the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the revolution held across Iran witnessed participation by both veiled and unveiled women.
“There is a law regarding the hijab in our country, and that is enforced in government offices, but there is no strictness in public gatherings,” he said, adding that similar social variations were visible in other Muslim societies, including Pakistan.
He clarified that certain dress codes applied within government institutions, as was the case in many countries, but only Iran was targeted by the Western media.
“Western media never showed the progress made in this regard, as women’s participation in Iran’s higher education is huge. There are more female students in Iranian universities than male students, and women are scientists and hold senior posts even in highly technical projects,” he said.
“But nobody compares the representation of women across professions in Iran with other Islamic countries, or with what it was before the Islamic revolution,” Mr Moghadam added.
“Nobody among us would like to see the status of women as commercial products or be named in those notorious file[s of late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein],” the envoy maintained, and concluded that the status of women should be seen in the context of Iran’s social laws and societal norms.

As per details, the incident occurred near the traffic police office on the Old GT Road where one Tahir Beig (60) of Chak Buzarag was going home on his motorcycle when was stopped at a picket by the traffic police. 
The police officials reportedly imposed a fine of Rs2,000 on the motorcyclist for not wearing a helmet. He requested the duty officials to spare him as he did not have the amount on him to pay the fine. However, the officials declined to accept his request. 
The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot. 
Some eyewitnesses called Rescue 1122 and they pronounced him dead after a checkup. 
The rescue and police officials later shifted the body to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH). 
A spokesperson for the Gujrat Police confirmed that the elderly man died of a heart attack after the traffic officials imposed a fine on him. 
He said that the doctors at the ABSTH had declared heart attack as the cause of his death. 
The Gujrat DPO ordered the SP (investigation) to conduct an inquiry into the incident.
