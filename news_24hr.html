After days of struggling to brush off what he now claims is a Democratic hoax, Trump took his most combative tone yet to try and shut down the issue.
“It’s all been a big hoax, it’s perpetrated by the Democrats. And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” Trump told reporters when asked about Epstein.
But Trump is facing the most serious split in his loyal right-wing base since he returned to power, over claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of disgraced financier Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for abuse by the rich and powerful.
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched on to the scandal, claiming the existence of a secret list of Epstein’s powerful clients and that the late financier was in fact murdered in his cell.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office this January but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.

And against this backlash, we see the old instincts swinging into play.
The prime minister has reportedly asked the FBR to ‘go slow’ with the powers they have been vested in the Finance Act for FY26, and the finance ministry has formed a committee to hold talks with the business community around these powers. Against these steps, the leadership of the Karachi-based Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry has reportedly postponed its strike call given for this Saturday, while the Lahore business community appears steadfast in its resolve to continue with the strike plan.
This is as per newspaper reports, and it is still possible that either of these associations could change their minds before the big day. The business communities of these cities are usually very risk-averse in their dealings with the government and issue strike statements routinely to get attention from the policymakers and then walk it all back once this goal is achieved. We will know by Saturday how serious they are in their resolve this time round.
But we don’t need to wait for Saturday to see that coercive powers such as these are usually not very helpful in realising revenues or aiding documentation. Efforts have been launched in the past to push the business community to document themselves by requiring conditions such as retaining the CNIC of their vendors for each transaction, or manually serving notices on hundreds of thousands of individuals in an effort to get them to file their returns.
Remember when Shabbar Zaidi, as FBR chairman back in 2019, announced that 3.1 million consumers had commercial electricity connections without any presence on the tax rolls, and 347,000 had industrial electricity connections without being registered? Remember when he served approximately 100,000 tax notices on non-sales tax compliant people who could be seen to be running businesses otherwise? That was probably the strongest single effort at manual documentation we had seen in a long time. But despite a very strong push, it came to nothing, as a strike call by the traders forced the government to capitulate rapidly.

Having failed to broaden the tax net, they are now talking of ‘tax deepening’.

This time there are important differences, no doubt. But the fact that it is a manual documentation drive, rather than an automated process, that they are launching is common to both efforts. Our own history shows us that despite the claims of the government of the time, the brunt of such efforts falls first on those that are already compliant, from whom they extract more and more. Meanwhile, the non-compliant find ways to ward off the administrative machinery of the FBR.
This time, a rather large confrontation seems to be getting going. The FBR’s powers have been ramped up significantly, with the most important one being the power to arrest people for the purpose of tax recovery. Anecdotal evidence suggests the courts are clearing out the pipeline of stay orders that had been issued against tax demands in the past, and this process has helped clear the way for more than Rs800 billion worth of recovery through ‘enforcement measures’ that the government claims for FY25. In the coming year, it appears the courts are not likely to be of much help to those who have had tax demands served on them, and the FBR will have significantly more power to pile on the pressure on those who have had a demand created on them. Whether this results in smoother and more buoyant revenue collection or turns into a source of significant friction between state and capital remains to be seen, but it is difficult to envision how this can become a sustainable model for meeting the next generation of the country’s revenue needs.
At best, they will squeeze another year’s worth of revenue out of existing taxpayers through means such as these, after having squeezed them dry in FY25 already. After that, they will turn to more radical steps to meet their revenue needs — perhaps a constitutional amendment to allow them to reverse the NFC award and let resources from the provinces flow back to the centre.
The state hit the limits of its resource envelope a few years ago. Perhaps the year in which it had to pay out more in interest payments than it could bring in as tax revenue was one of these turning points. From there onwards, it has been scrounging harder and harder to find the next generation of revenues to meet its needs. Having failed to broaden the tax net, they are now talking of ‘tax deepening’ and searching within their own professed tax gaps to see if ramped-up enforcement can serve up the next generation of revenues.
It is easy to see how this effort will fail, and FY26 is likely the year when this failure point is hit. The FBR does not have the machinery to reach the vast majority of incomes that comprise this tax gap, nor can it reach the incomes of the traders or small enterprises it is trying to reach with its ramped-up powers this fiscal year. They are going to try nonetheless, and most likely along the way increase the burden on those they can reach.
The question is, how much damage will they do along the way? They are trying to act like a ‘hard state’ without actually being a hard state, and this sort of behaviour does more harm than good. So far, they’ve managed to squeeze an annual target’s worth of revenues out of the compliant citizenry using these means. And their effort to ramp up this drive has already hit choppy waters at the outset of the new fiscal year, forcing them to retreat just a tad. But the months ahead promise ramped-up confrontation and a more muscular approach to taxation that borders on outright appropriation.

Climate risks are interprovincial and multi-sectoral. There is a disconnect between well-intentioned policies and their effective implementation oversight by apex institutions, largely due to coordination and operational bottlenecks. Our climate governance architecture encompasses at least six apex councils, in addition to several commissions, authorities, boards and autonomous bodies. These institutions collectively form the backbone of our administrative state, designed to ensure coherent climate policy implementation and democratic oversight.
Infrequent institutional meetings: At the heart of our climate governance difficulties is insufficient coordination and the infrequent convening of vital policymaking bodies. Many institutions, despite constitutional or statutory mandates for regular meetings, struggle to maintain a consistent schedule. For example, the Council of Common Interests, crucial for interprovincial climate policy coordination, meets far less often than constitutionally required. Similarly, the National Economic Council (NEC) frequently misses its mandated biannual gatherings, hindering the alignment of economic planning with climate targets.
A closer look reveals direct impediments to sectoral progress. The National Security Council, despite acknowledging non-traditional threats in its National Security Policy (2021), has primarily focused on conventional security issues, neglecting crucial decisions on climate-induced risks and threats. This oversight prevents the systematic integration of climate security into national planning.
In water management, the Pakistan Water Council’s single meeting since its inception in 2018 means crucial opportunities for a unified approach to the nation’s severe water crisis are missed, leaving Pakistan without cohesive climate-integrated water strategies. Even more striking, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Council, despite its coordination mandate, has convened just twice in four decades, leaving a significant void as Pakistan faces escalating environmental challenges. It has not convened stakeholders since the 18th Amendment was passed. The Pakistan Climate Change Council, designed to spearhead climate action across sectors, has also met far less often than its required biannual schedule since its creation in 2017.

Addressing climate action gaps is fundamental to transforming our aspirations into action.

Despite our extreme vulnerability, climate considerations and coordination remain virtually absent across the six councils, hindering comprehensive planning to address climate threats. Some national commissions grapple with similar dilemmas. For disaster management, for example, the National Disaster Management Commission’s infrequent meetings since its inception in 2010 prevent interprovincial coordination and the systematic integration of climate science into disaster risk management.
Approval bottlenecks: Many other institutions face delays due to required formal approval for key appointments. Frequent delays in leadership appointments at the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, Pakistan Council for Research on Water Resources and the Pakistan Council for Science & Technology have routinely hindered development in climate-resilient agriculture, water and scientific research.Examples abound where the lack of high-level engagement has compromised the integration of climate into national development strategies, leading to critical climate decisions being delayed or overlooked.
These challenges have tangible consequences for climate commitments. For example, the ambitious 60 per cent renewable electricity goal by 2030 is hindered by lack of provincial coordination. Similarly, the National Adaptation Plan needs strong cross-sectoral coordination, but dormant key bodies leave adaptation efforts fragmented.
Pathways to reform: These are chronic challenges, yet opportunities exist to address them. The prime minister can convene a joint meeting of the six apex councils, along with the planning and other commissions, to craft a shared vision. It will boost coordination of the national climate agenda, and not only help clear the existing backlog but also inject renewed vigour into languishing institutions. The latter include the National Commission for Science & Technology — Pakistan’s apex body for science and technology development and the National Commission on the Status of Women(NSCW) — a marginalised institution mandated to promote gender equity. Such a collaborative approach is vital for revitalising institutional effectiveness and accelerating Pakistan’s climate action.
There are at least two examples where the PM’s powers are effectively delegated. The finance minister has become the de facto head of the NEC. The Planning Commission has historically been managed by the deputy chairman. Can this functioning model be replicated to appoint deputy chairmen of all the six councils as well as commissions for managing routine functioning? The delegated authority arrangements with prime ministerial oversight could significantly enhance operational continuity.
Streamlining appointment processes is crucial for preventing prolonged leadership vacancies. Some professional bodies have successfully elected chairmen — the Pakistan Engineering Council has had at least 12 chosen since its inception in 1976. Pakistan has also experimented with parliamentary committees partially overseeing chairperson selections.
Finally, a systemic challenge arises from the fact that the concerned ministries are not always prompt in initiating the necessary summaries for meetings. This presents the potential for a conflict of interest when the ministry itself is responsible for driving discussions that might involve critical self-assessment or policy adjustments. To address this, an independent cell, potentially housed within the PM’s office, could proactively maintain a roster of upcoming meetings and help the executive office clear backlogs, thereby enhancing whole-of-government coordination and efficiency.
After all, Pakistan’s journey towards climate resilience is intrinsically linked to the effectiveness of its apex institutions. While the nation has articulated climate policies and commitments, the present challenges stem from institutional shortcomings. Addressing these governance issues, leadership gaps and coordination failures is not merely an administrative task; it is fundamental to transforming our climate aspirations into tangible action.
The path forward requires sustained political commitment to reform, recognising that robust institutional effectiveness is the bedrock upon which successful climate action is built. The urgency of this endeavour cannot be overstated as the costs of inaction continue to mount.

In fact, progress in this area in the last two decades has shown how digital technology holds the key to inclusive growth, economic productivity, better governance and global competitiveness.
But Pakistan has been unable to fully unleash its digital potential in spite of several government initiatives in the past decade, a large, young, tech-savvy population and growing internet access. This is mainly due to patchy efforts in this direction thanks to the absence of a comprehensive policy framework. With only 17.7pc of people making digital payments in Pakistan — where 59m payment cards, accounting for only 24pc of the population, have been issued, compared to 71pc in India — the potential for adopting digital technology here is being wasted. Consider that our e-commerce spending at $10bn in 2023 was far below Bangladesh’s $16bn due to barriers such as limited POS infrastructure and low digital literacy.
It is against this background that the Asian Development Bank’s new study, Pakistan’s Digital Ecosystem: A Diagnostic Report, suggests an array of fiscal and bank financing incentives, as well as simplified tax and foreign exchange regimes, to encourage digital transactions, support tech start-ups, promote e-commerce and attract global ICT investment and venture capital into the country. The proposals include decreasing GST on digital dealings to 5pc to accelerate digital payments and hence reduce cash-based inefficiencies in the economy.
The study also proposes cutting corporate income tax and the cost of doing business for SMEs by 10pc for the next decade, conditional on digital registration and transactions. A ‘Data Exchange Layer’ and full adoption of the ‘Pakistan Digital Stack’ are advised to digitise governance and regulation, as well as the allocation of at least 15pc of bank loan portfolios for SMEs, with half earmarked for digital and ICT businesses, in order to provide low-interest loans and guarantees to tech firms. It also proposes capping payroll taxation at 15pc of income for ICT-exporting firms and offering tax credits for hiring local talent and a capital gains tax exemption on investments in tech start-ups.
Indeed, the proposals do not align with the main goals of fiscal consolidation of the $7bn IMF programme. The FBR will also resist such steps as they are likely to cause a big dent in its revenues without alternative tax mobilisation sources to make up for potential losses. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that Pakistan and its economy stand at a point where they need to shift to digital technology and move out of recurring crises. The challenges notwithstanding, digital technology affords Pakistan a unique opportunity to transform itself into a dynamic digital economy to boost productivity and competitiveness, improve governance and empower its citizens.

A meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, presided over by Syed Naveed Qamar, expressed concern over tax exemptions on the import of sugar.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial informed the committee that sugar imports were subject to a total of 54 per cent tax, resulting in higher retail prices of the commodity. He said the FBR had granted tax exemptions on sugar imports after receiving the federal cabinet’s decision in this regard.
Mr Qamar observed that the government should disengage from sugar-related matters and allow the private sector to handle its import and export. He said that while the prices of other commodities fluctuate based on supply and demand, increases in sugar prices consistently trigger public outcry. He added that it was surprising the government had deregulated wheat operations yet continued to focus on sugar prices, despite sufficient sugar stocks being available in the country.
 
 


Food ministry says retail price to be capped at Rs175 per kilogram

Committee member Javed Hanif inquired about the IMF’s stance on the tax exemption for sugar imports. He criticised the government for attributing every budgetary measure to IMF requirements, noting that taxes had been imposed even on poultry chicks and mutual funds, while sugar had been granted an exemption.
The finance secretary told the committee that discussions with the IMF were still ongoing on the issue.
The committee also considered “The Parliamentary Budget Office Bill, 2025”, moved by MNA Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, and constituted a subcommittee under the convenorship of MNA Nafisa Shah for detailed deliberation and submission of a report within 30 days. MNAs Ali Zahid, Arshad Abdullah Vohra and Muhammad Mobeen Arif will serve as members of the subcommittee.
The standing committee expressed serious concern over the absence of the industries and production secretary, who was scheduled to give a detailed briefing on the new electric vehicle (EV) policy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani regretted the absence and agreed with the committee’s decision to defer the agenda item related to the EV policy.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig presented the report of the subcommittee on “The Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2025”, moved by Nafisa Shah. The committee adopted the report but deferred discussion on it to the next meeting.
The Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) opposed the bill and requested additional time to consult all stakeholders. However, Nafisa Shah, Ikhtiar Baig and Javed Hanif opposed granting further time to the government on the matter.
Mr Kayani said it would be premature for him to state whether the draft bill would be supported or opposed, but emphasised that broader consultation with stakeholders was necessary before any informed discussion could take place in the committee.
The committee chairman allowed the government one month to complete its consultations.
Sugar price at Rs175 a kg
Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Wednesday said that the retail price of sugar in the market will not exceed Rs173 to Rs175 in the wake of the ex-mill price of sugar fixed at Rs165 per kg.
A formal notification, fixing the retail price, is being finalised and will be issued after approval from the federal cabinet, the ministry says. Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain emphasised that all provincial governments will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the approved retail price of sugar, providing relief to consumers and maintaining price stability across the country.

The seminar, hosted by the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Tuesday, was attended by leaders and workers from various political parties.
Speaking at the event, participants voiced grave concern over the worsening law and order situation in Balochistan, alleged genocide of the Baloch people, the arrest of female leaders and activists, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the controversial adoption of the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act.
BNP-M President Sardar Akhtar Mengal presided over the hours-long seminar.

Political leaders slam human rights violations, call for end to military operations

The speakers criticised the military operations, enforced disappearances and the discovery of mutilated bodies in the province. They denounced the inclusion of political activists in the Fourth Schedule (a terror watch list) and condemned the violation of the sanctity of homes during nighttime raids.
The speakers also denounced the systematic political killings and the installation of “puppet leadership” in both Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 






The declaration made during the seminar referred to the suppression of national movements through force as a modern form of colonialism that threatens the federation’s integrity.
The seminar also pointed to the denial of democratic space and the promotion of artificial leadership as a strategy to facilitate the exploitation of the region’s natural resources. The amendments to the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act were described as legislative tools designed to enable the exploitation of Balochistan’s vast mineral wealth.
Political victimisation of Sardar Akhtar Mengal and his family was described as part of a campaign to silence dissent.
The seminar also drew parallels with the deteriorating security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Fata regions, which they said was also rooted in the desire to control local mineral resources under the guise of counterinsurgency.

The KCCI has installed hoardings and billboards across major arteries of Karachi announcing the complete strike, with slogans demanding respect for taxpayers “instead of handcuffs”.
Despite the formation of a high-level committee by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy, the KCCI leadership remains resolute in its decision. The committee, comprised of multiple stakeholders, has been tasked with conducting a 30-day consultation process to formulate a consensus-based proposal for submission to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
Mr Bilwani said the strike decision was reaffirmed following an unproductive meeting with the finance minister, where key demands to suspend five major anti-business measures were left unaddressed. These demands include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, which grant sweeping powers of arrest and prosecution to tax officials; repeal of Section 21(S), which imposes penalties on cash transactions of Rs200,000 or more; abolition of Section 40C, mandating the e-Bilty system for goods transport; rollback of SRO 709, which enforces a flawed digital invoicing system; and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
 
 


KCCI confirms July 19 shutdown over unaddressed tax grievances

In a statement, Mr Bilwani criticised those spreading rumours about the strike, stating that such elements have no affiliation with the movement and are not part of the consultative process.
He stressed that the strike call was the result of extensive discussions with presidents and representatives of leading chambers of commerce and industry from all four provinces.
He further clarified that any decision to defer or cancel the strike would only be made through mutual consensus and formally announced at a joint press conference attended by all supporting chambers. “No decision will be made unilaterally or behind closed doors,” he assured.
Mr Bilwani lashed out at those disseminating false narratives, calling them enemies of the business community attempting to derail a unified national cause. He reaffirmed that preparations for the strike are complete across the country and appealed to industrialists, wholesalers, shopkeepers, and traders to stand in solidarity with the movement for the sake of the economy and the nation.
He concluded by urging the business community and the public to disregard misinformation and rely solely on official announcements issued by the KCCI and its legitimate partners.

The call comes as more than 1.3 million Afghans have returned to the country this year, straining communities where 70 percent of people live in poverty, the UN envoy said in a press statement.
“Afghanistan’s stability hinges on shared responsibility,” Ms Otunbayeva said in the statement circulated by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).
“We cannot afford indifference; the cost of inaction will be measured in lives lost and conflicts reignited.”
 
 

Women and children face the gravest risks, returning not only to dire economic hardships but to a context where their access to basic services and social protections remains severely constrained, Ms Otunbayeva said.
“Do not turn away,” she appealed to donors, development partners and regional governments.
“The returnees must not be abandoned. What we are witnessing are the direct consequences of unmet global responsibilities. We must act now — with resources, with coordination, and with resolve.”
Ms Otunbayeva said the United Nations in Afghanistan is calling for an integrated approach that resources humanitarian needs while scaling up assistance in areas of return.
She underscored the need for immediate reintegration assistance, including livelihood programs and community infrastructure investments, to stabilise communities.
Without swift interventions, the UN warned that remittance losses, labour market pressures and cyclical migration could lead to destabilisation, renewed displacement and risks to regional stability.
“What should be a positive homecoming moment for families who fled conflict decades ago is instead marked by exhaustion, trauma, and profound uncertainty,” she said after visiting the Islam Qala border crossing.
“The sheer volume of returns — many abrupt, many involuntary — should be setting off alarm bells across the global community.”
“It is a test of our collective humanity,” she added. “Afghanistan, already grappling with drought, and a chronic humanitarian crisis, cannot absorb this shock alone.”
Humanitarian operations remain dangerously underfunded, forcing agonising choices between food, shelter and safe passage, according to UNAMA.
Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA), said in a recent report that the number of Afghans returning from Iran has increased significantly following the recent escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran.
Approximately 167,000 Afghans returned from Iran between July 1 and July 5 alone.
The report noted that as political tensions and anti-Afghan sentiment rise, the profile of returnees has shifted, with families now comprising over 60 percent of those returning, in contrast to the predominantly single males of previous waves.

Although alert, both Indus River System Authority (Irsa) and Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) responding to warning are jubilant and promising to “absorb” the entire stream at Mangla Dam, where such cushion is available.
According to Irsa spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana, the authority would do its best to store the entire stream. “In fact, the authority was hoping, and praying, for River Jehlum to swell during this monsoon and yield some additional water. At present, Mangla Dam is standing at 1,186 feet, against its maximum level of 1,242 feet – it still can go up by 56 feet. It is holding 3.41 million acre feet of water, whereas it can go up to 7.3 million feet.
 
 

“Irsa’s optimism of absorbing the entire flood wave is based on the filling criteria. Unlike Tarbella, where after reaching a certain level, only one foot of water can be stored in 24 hours. Mangla Dam does not have any such restriction. It can absorb triple the amount of water which is being warned against, the authority’s spokesman claimed.

Irsa, Wapda officials say Mangla Dam still has 56 feet to fill; ex-official cautions about a catch

“Wapda is also determined to host it all,” says Azam Joya, General Manager (Coordination and Monitoring). But still, Wapda has moved all experts to Mangla Dam, set up a control room and is now evaluating all reports and monitoring river and its tributaries. Those managing Tarbella Dam are also onboard and providing back-up to the Mangla mangers. “Yes, Mangla Dam does not have any filling restrictions, but history of its filling is a guide and the authority is keeping that in mind. If the wave remains within the limits of forecast, things would remain under control,” he believed.
Mangla Dam GM Fakhar Jahan is equally confident and terms the situation at Dam “normal.” In an official communication, he says “in this regard (warning of high stream in river Jhelum), it is to inform that dam is being monitored vigilantly in accordance with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs). At present, the situation at dam is normal.
The hydrology directorate remains fully operational round-the-clock and closely observing the prevailing conditions. There is ample storage available to safely absorb the anticipated inflows and any potential peak. And relevant stakeholders will be promptly informed of the actual inflows received at Mangla Reservoir.“

• Women make up only 13.5pc of workforce
ISLAMABAD: Women in wage employment earn substantially lower wages than their male counterparts in Pakistan, according to a report launched by the International Labour Organ­isation (ILO) on Wednesday.
The ‘Pakistan Gender Pay Gap Report 2025’ estimates the gender pay gap at approximately 25 per cent based on hourly wages and 30pc based on monthly wages. The gender pay gap in Pakistan is also significant by international standards. In comparison, lower-middle-income countries — the income group Pakistan falls under — have an average gender pay gap of 21pc based on monthly wages and 17pc based on hourly wages.
While launching the report, Secretary of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhary reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.
 
 

He said the report and accompanying action plan represent a vital step towards identifying and addressing the barriers that hinder women’s participation in the economy.
This, he added, would support Pakistan in progressively fulfilling its obligations under the ratified ILO Convention on Equal Remuneration and the Convention on Discrimination.
ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said: “We now have the evidence, the commitment, and the partnerships to move from promise to practice. The ILO stands ready to support Pakistan in advancing fair and transparent wage-setting systems, formalising informal work, and creating real opportunities for women across all sectors.”
Alongside a large gender pay gap, women’s employment is limited in Pakistan. In 2021, women’s employment rate was around 23pc compared to 79pc for men.
This reflects a gender gap in employment of 56 percentage points, higher than the gap in other countries in the South Asia region. This means that Pakistani women are substantially less likely than men to have paid jobs and that, even when they are in wage employment, women earn substantially lower than men.
 
 

The report also finds that women account for just 13.5pc of employees in Pakistan.
Data in the report also showed that women who are in wage employment are more likely than their male counterparts to have a high level of education.
Moreover, women employees are more likely than men to work in the public sector and in formal employment, as well as in jobs with permanent contracts, in professional occupations and in larger firms.

• Glacial calving intensifying flooding
• Questions raised over efficacy of early warning systems
Unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns, and glacial calving have triggered intense floods in Gilgit-Baltistan, leaving a trail of destruction behind that has locals feeling apprehensive about their future amid a climate change crisis.
The crisis is further exacerbated by faulty early warning systems, which are supposed to disseminate timely alerts amid disasters to minimise human and infrastructure losses.
According to authorities, the unusual movements of glaciers and intense heatwaves across the region this year have resulted in massive destruction in downstream areas.
The region, home to around 8,400 glaciers and over 4,000 glacier lakes, has seen its ice cover deplete at a rapid pace, triggering glacial lake outburst floods and threatening future water shortages.
 
 

“Glof events, glacier surges, land erosion from increasing water levels in rivers and streams across the region have badly affected livelihoods, damaged homes, public and private infrastructures, agriculture lands and crops recently,” said GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) DG Zakir Hussain. He said it was obvious that climate change had altered the behaviour of glaciers.
In Hamorkhay village in Nagar Khas, dozens of households near the Hoper glacier have witnessed a surge in water levels, leading to erosion of swathes of land in this settlement.
According to the local administration, six homes situated at the glacier side were damaged, with thousands of kanals of agriculture land, standing crops and cattle farms submerged by water released by the melting glacier.
Akbar Hussain, a local, told Dawn the situation was unimaginable. “The glacier surged speedily this year. The water originating from the glacier flowed towards the village side and started eroding lands, crops, trees and cattle farms, and ultimately threatened homes,” he said.
According to GB Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain, heatwaves triggered by climate change have disturbed the normal structure of glaciers across GB.
He pointed out several factors, including carbon emissions and environmental degradation, which were contributing to these anomalous phenomena. GB is facing environmental challenges such as deforestation, encroachment of green belts, reckless construction and emissions from vehicles. The duration of the dry season has increased and rainfall is becoming scant, he said.
 
 

Meanwhile, snowfall is occurring in the months of February, March and May instead of the more suitable winter months, which allows snow enough time to solidify into ice before the summer sets in.
He said snowfall in these months was not adding to glaciers, rather melting rapidly in May and June, triggering floods.
Glacial calving
While the melting of glaciers is releasing heavy deluges in waterways, glacial calving is further exacerbating the intensity of these floods.
This phenomenon sees chunks of solid ice break away from the glacier and travel downstream. They damage homes and properties along the river and often block waterways, thus increasing the water level. When these ice blocks melts, the built-up water gushes down, causing widespread destruction.
Zubair Ahmed, who is the GBDMA Assistant Director in Hunza and Nagar, said the Shisper glacier in Hassanabad had demonstrated unusual movement this year, as pieces of ice were moving with the waters in Hassanabad nullah.
He said that chunks from the glacier blocked the flow of water, causing a flood in the nullah when the build-up eventually breaks. “We are monitoring the Shisper glacier to avoid any human loss downstream,” he added.
In other areas of GB, rapidly melting glaciers triggered floods in Supultar nullah, Hamari nullah, Shimshal river, Khunjerab river, Shigar river and Indus river. The rapid melting of ice in a short amount of time results in water shortages in the remaining months. The GBEPA has expressed fears of a major water crisis in the region due to climate change.
Faulty early warning systems
In view of climatic threats, early warning systems and automatic weather stations worth billions of rupees were installed at glaciers in some parts of GB.
However, most of these systems are either non-functional, have been stolen, or lack the capacity to disseminate timely alerts, according to sources.
Mr Hussain of the GBEPA claimed that international organisations had installed the equipment without consulting local bodies or adhering to environmental laws and regulations.
The GBEPA had imposed a fine of Rs5 million on a donor-funded Glof-II project for degrading the aesthetic beauty of the high-altitude Kutwal lake in Haramosh Gilgit by installing advanced weather stations station on green belts near the lake.
These systems are “actually damaging the environment”, Mr Hussain claimed.

Israeli and Hamas negotiators have been taking part in the latest round of ceasefire talks in Doha since July 6, discussing a US-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that envisages a phased release of Israeli prisoners, Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, and discussions on ending the conflict.
 
 

Trump will host the Qatari leader for dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening, the White House said in a daily schedule for the president. Trump on Sunday said he hoped talks for a ceasefire deal would be “straightened out” this week.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had said on Sunday he was “hopeful” about the ceasefire negotiations under way in Qatar, a key mediator between the two sides.

Hamas denies Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks; 21 Palestinians killed in stampede at US-backed aid distribution site

Hamas says no progress in ceasefire talks
Hamas accused Israel on Wednesday of wanting to retain military control of the Gaza Strip, and denied Israeli media claims of progress in ceasefire talks.
The indirect negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha are now in their second week, with the future presence of Israeli troops in the Palestinian territory a key issue.
Hamas wants a full withdrawal and last week rejected an Israeli proposal which it said would have kept troops in more than 40 per cent of Gaza.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan on Wednesday quoted a foreign official it did not identify as saying that work was ongoing to revise Israeli pullback maps.
But Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said: “(Israel) has not yet delivered any new or revised maps regarding military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
 
 

“The entire Gaza Strip is currently under the military control of Israel. What is happening on the ground confirms (Israel’s) intentions and plans to maintain and prolong military control within the Gaza Strip for the long term.”
21 Palestinians seeking aid killed
At least 21 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday at an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in what the US-backed group claimed was a crowd surge instigated by armed agitators.
The GHF, which is supported by Israel, said 19 people were trampled and one fatally stabbed during the crush at one of its centres in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
“We have credible reason to believe that elements within the crowd armed and affiliated with Hamas deliberately fomented the unrest,” GHF claimed in a statement.
Hamas rejected the GHF allegation as false and misleading, saying GHF guards and Israeli soldiers sprayed people with pepper gas and opened fire.
 
 

Witnesses said that guards at the site sprayed pepper gas at them after they had locked the gates to the centre, trapping them between the gates and the outer wire-fence.
People kept gathering and pressuring each other; when people pushed each other…those who couldn’t stand fell under the people and were crushed,“ said eyewitness Mahmoud Fojo, 21, who was hurt in the stampede.
“Some people started jumping over the netted fence and got wounded. We were injured, and God saved us. We were under the people and we said the Shahada (death prayers). We thought we were dying, finished,” he added.
Palestinian health officials said that 21 people had died of suffocation at the site. One medic said lots of people had been crammed into a small space and had been crushed. On Tuesday, the UN rights office in Geneva said it had recorded at least 875 killings within the past six weeks in the vicinity of aid sites and food convoys in Gaza - the majority of them close to GHF distribution points.
Most of those deaths were caused by gunfire that locals have blamed on the Israeli military.
The UN has called the GHFs model unsafe and a breach of humanitarian impartiality standards. Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, accused the GHF on Wednesday of gross mismanagement.
“People who flock in their thousands (to GHF sites) are hungry and exhausted, and they get squeezed into narrow places, amid shortages of aid and the absence of organisation and discipline by the GHF,” he said.

• Insiders say most middle-tier leaders not satisfied with top brass’ handling of Aug 5 protest, seek concrete plan
AFTER Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur caught nearly everyone by surprise when he gave a fresh deadline — ostensibly on behalf of incarcerated former PM Imran Khan — public disagreements over the party’s strategy to secure the release of their jailed leaders have spilled out into the open.
With both the middle- and top-tier leaders virtually ‘airing their dirty laundry’, the party founder — who personally doesn’t have access to social media in jail — has had to intervene, asking party leaders and supporters to refrain from expressing dissent in public, and instead focus on the Aug 5 protest.
Differences between various groups within the party, which have already been widely reported, resurfaced after CM Gandapur blindsided party leaders and came up with a new, 90-day deadline.
The apparent ‘postponement’ came under scrutiny right away, with Aliya Hamza Malik — the party’s main organiser in Punjab, tasked with mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 — questioning the motive behind the move.
Although her blunt query attracted a rebuke from Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, asking her not to express such views in public, the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate threw his weight behind her. “Ms Malik’s complaint was right,” Senator Ali Zafar reportedly told Mr Raja, adding that she should have been consulted in the matter.
Since then, Mr Raja has changed his stance on the Aug 5 movement, saying the extension was the ‘personal opinion’ of the KP CM.
It was already apparent from this argument that the party’s top-tier leadership is not seeing eye to eye on how to proceed with the ‘free Imran’ movement.
The way battle lines seem to be drawn at the moment, it seems that leaders like Ms Malik — who are working on the ground to mobilise people for the Aug 5 protest — have the backing of Barristers Ali Zafar and Gohar Ali Khan.
On the other side are Mr Raja and the group led by former PTI Punjab president Hammad Azhar.
Both camps are said to have the support of a couple of regional presidents in Punjab.
Against this backdrop, insiders told Dawn that most middle-tier leaders were not satisfied with the performance and ability of their seniors, who were orchestrating affairs at the top. “The top leaders, though appointed by Mr Khan himself, are unable to capitalise on the pressure generated,” a senior Punjab leader told Dawn, admitting that there was a leadership crisis in the party.
Meanwhile, the workers who have been enlisted by Ms Malik to make arrangements for the upcoming protest are demanding for a roadmap for the Aug 5 movement.
Imran ‘intervenes’
In the midst of this tug-of-war, a message from the incarcerated party leader — the only authority figure who can hope to exercise any discipline at the moment — has called on “every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances”.
“Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” said a message, posted on his official X account on Wednesday.
Even though Mr Khan doesn’t operate the account himself, there is a strong perception that the messages being relayed through it are generated at the behest of Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema.
“There is absolutely no question of bowing down, even if I have to spend my entire life in prison. I convey this same message to the people of Pakistan: under no circumstances should you submit to this tyrannical system. The time for negotiations has passed. What remains now is the time for the nation to rise in protest,” read the tweet posted on Mr Khan’s account.
He said hardships inflicted upon him in jail had “intensified in the recent days”, claiming the same was true for his wife Bushra Bibi. “All fundamental human rights and basic prisoner entitlements, both mine and hers, have been suspended. This must be accou­­nted for,” he said in the tweet.
 
 

“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances. Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” he said.
He urged the party workers and leaders to focus on the protest movement, warning that those who fail to do so would answer to him.
“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from jail.
I instruct all party members and office-bearers to personally retweet my messages on Twitter (now X), and ensure they are shared as extensively as possible. The party should decide on nominations for the Senate tickets through mutual consultation,“ the post on X said.

The deceased were identified as Head Const­able Ghulam Muhammad, from Panyala village in Dera Ismail Khan, and Constable Shehzad, from Aba Khel village in Lakki Marwat district.
According to a police spokesperson, the constables were travelling on a motorcycle when the incident took place. One of the constables, who had a disability, was being transported to a hospital by his colleague when they were attacked. The assailants fired upon them as they reached Shahi Gate, resulting in the death of both officers on the spot.
Police and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area after the attack and initiated a search operation. As the attackers attempted to flee, police returned fire, killing one assailant and injuring two others. A Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition were recovered from the deceased militant.
The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and district police continue to conduct an extensive search operation in the area. The funeral prayer for the martyred constables was held with full official honours at Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines in Dera Ismail Khan.
The ceremony was attended by Commissioner Dera Zafarul Islam Khattak, Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada, several civil and military officials A police contingent presented a guard of honour, and participants laid floral wreaths on the coffins and offered prayers for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.
The bodies of the constables were sent to their native villages, where they were laid to rest with full official honours. Initial investigations suggest that the attack was an act of terrorism.
Gas pipeline blown up
Meanwhile, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area of Lakki Marwat district late Tuesday night.
According to police, an IED that had been planted along the pipeline detonated with a loud explosion that was heard in the surrounding areas. The blast caused significant damage to the pipeline, which supplies gas to Punjab.
 
 

The explosion occurred within the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. Police and bomb disposal units later arrived at the site to investigate the incident. The blast halted the supply of gas from the Bettani oil and gas field to several regions.
It was the fourth attack on the gas infrastructure in the district within a month. Police have noted increased terrorist activity in the area and have increased security measures around the gas facilities.

While PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members, opposition parties have experienced slight variations in their seat allocations. The development has not impacted the overall seat count for the opposition, but individual party positions have shifted.
The ECP reduced one reserved seat each for JUI-F and PPP, while one has been allocated to PML-N.
With the latest notifications, JUI-F and PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while PPP holds 10 seats. The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats.

ECP fears delay in oath-taking may affect Senate polls; asks PHC to designate ‘oath commissioner’

The fate of one of the 26 seats reserved for women is to be decided by a draw between ANP and PTI-P, while the reserved seat for non-Muslims will be determined through a similar process between JUI-F and PML-N.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. This shift follows the June 27 judgement by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench, which declared that PTI was not entitled to reserved seats in either the National or provincial assemblies.
Before that verdict, the opposition parties had 27 MPAs and were unable to requisition an assembly session. However, the opposition will now be able to requisition a session once their newly elected MPAs take the oath of office.
Both JUI-F and PML-N now hold seven general seats, nine seats rese­rved for women and one rese­rved seat for non-Muslims each.
The PPP holds four general seats, five reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each hold two general seats and one reserved seat for women.
 
 

Before the ECP’s July 15 order, which granted PML-N entitlement to reserved seats for women and non-Muslims based on seven general seats, the commission had calculated these seats based on six general seats. In the 2024 general elections, JUI-F was entitled to 10 seats reserved for women and two reserved seats for non-Muslims based on the seven general seats it won.
PML-N had previously been allocated eight reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims, while PPP had six reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each held one MPA-elect each on seats reserved for women.
ECP approaches PHC
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) last week annulled the original distribution of reserved seats in the KP Assembly and ordered the ECP to redistribute these seats within 10 days.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal, announced the reserved judgement on the petition of the PML-N against the distribution of reserved seats. In its verdict, the court declared both the ECP’s announcements regarding the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities null and void.
The court had previously deemed the ECP’s Feb 22 deadline for independent candidates to join political parties unconstitutional.
In a desperate move, the ECP approached the PHC on Wednesday, requesting that it appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect on reserved seats.
In a letter to the court’s registrar, the Election Commission pointed out that the Senate elections in KP were days away and the electoral college was still incomplete.
According to the letter seen by Dawn, the ECP requested that the PHC chief justice, under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, may appoint a person to administer the oath to the elected members of the KP Assembly on the reserved seats before the Senate polling date (July 21).
The commission had previously written letters to the speaker of the KP Assembly, the governor and the chief minister, urging them to ensure the oath-taking of the members-elect; however, no progress has been made so far.
Wednesday’s letter emphasised that the conduct of the Senate election and the administration of oath to the returned candidates are constitutional imperatives and also a fundamental right of the members-elect to represent their constituencies.
The commission said that it is entrusted with the responsibility to organise and conduct elections under Articles 219(b) and 224(3) of the Constitution, and Section 107 of the Elections Act, 2017. Furthermore, Article 218(3) of the Constitution mandates the ECP to ensure that elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly, and in accordance with the law.

• Major leading Awaran operation martyred
QUETTA: Just days after the deadly bus attack in the Zhob area of Balochistan, another passenger bus came under attack that claimed three innocent lives, including two Karachi-based Sabri qawwals, and left 13 others injured on the outskirts of Kalat on Wednesday.
SSP Shahzad told Dawn that three people who lost their lives in bus firing Kalat included famous qawal Ahmed Hussain Sabri, his son Ahmed Raza Sabri, who left for Quetta along with other musicians of the group in a bus.
“My brother, nephew and one musician killed in the armed attack,” famous Karachi-based Qawal Majid Ali Sabri said on the phone. He said his brother, nephew and other musicians were travelling to Quetta for performance at a wedding ceremony.
“My close relatives and musicians are among the injured,” added Majid Sabri who along with his wife is due in the provincial capital on Thursday (today).
Officials said the armed assailants were lying in ambush on both sides of the Quetta-Karachi highway in Nemargh area and used automatic weapons to carry out the assault. “They first stopped the coach and then opened indiscriminate fire,” an official said while quoting eyewitness accounts.
The attack came on the day when a security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” in Awaran, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said an army officer, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, embraced martyrdom while leading the operation.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalat Shahzad Akbar confirmed the bus shooting and said three individuals were killed on the spot, while 13 others sustained injuries. The victims were musicians from a Karachi-based band who were en route to Quetta for a performance, police said.
 
 

The injured were identified as Haider, Imran, Manzar, Abbas, Muhammad Saqib, Faysal, Muh­ammad Nadeem, Muha­mmad Rizwan, Musawir Abbas, Muha­m­mad Waris, Faizan, Dilshad (all from Karachi), Najeeb Ahmed (driver), and Bilal Ahmed.
Hospital officials said the victims had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, mostly to the head and upper part of their body. Some of the critically injured are being shifted to Quetta for advanced medical treatment, they said.
According to Imtiaz Lehri, who had booked the team, Majid Sabri was due in Quetta on Thursday along with his wife by air, and a hotel room was booked for them.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed the incident, casualties and location of the assault. He said, “Security forces, district administration, and rescue teams immediately reached the site. A search operation is underway, and the attackers are being pursued.”
He said the terrorists had planned the attack and launched it from both sides of the road. “We cannot yet confirm the number of assailants.”
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti wrote on X, “Targeting innocent and defenseless civilians is an unforgivable crime.” He also blamed India-backed terrorist organisations, stating, “These groups once targeted people based on identity, but are now indiscriminately attacking civilians. This is a war against every Pakistani.” He termed the attack a direct assault on Pakistan’s unity, sovereignty, and peace and pledged that the government would eradicate such threats at all costs.
 






Army officer martyred
On the other hand, the Inter-Services Public relations said on Wednesday night security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” while an officer of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom while leading the operation conducted in Awaran area.
The ISPR reported that the operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about terrorist presence in the area.
“During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorist location, killing three Indian-sponsored terrorists,” it added.
Tragically, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, 34, a brave officer from Muzaffarabad, embraced martyrdom while leading his troops in the operation. “Major Tariq led from the front and paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the nation,” the statement read.
It said a sanitisation operation was underway in the area to eliminate any remaining threats.
The ISPR added, “Security forces of Pakistan are fully committed to eradicating Indian-sponsored terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers only strengthen our resolve.”

In Syria, the community is concentrated in the Sweida region bordering Jordan, in areas adjoining the Israeli-occupied Golan, and in Damascus’ Jaramana suburb.
Echoing arrangements for the Alawites, French colonial authorities established a state called Jabal al-Druze centred on Sweida until 1936.

After Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Druze held protests against Assad but were spared most of the mass violence that unfolded elsewhere in the country. They faced periodic attacks from other groups, including from President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir Al Sham and other militants who regard their sect as heretical.
The Druze maintain a degree of secrecy about the practice of their faith that emerged in the 11th century and incorporates elements from Islam and other philosophies, emphasising monotheism, reincarnation and the pursuit of truth.
Friction between Druze and Syria’s new authorities has broken out into fighting several times this year, notably in Jaramana and Suweida. Israel has intervened with airstrikes against Syrian government forces during the clashes with the stated aim of protecting the Druze.
‘Catastrophic situation’
“A lot of my friends were killed, including a doctor who was going to the hospital,” said Osama, 32, by telephone on Wednesday, adding he was in the centre of the southern city.
“There were summary executions in the streets,” he told AFP, crying, declining to provide his surname.
“If they reach here, I’m dead,” he said, adding: “I fear massacres similar to those on the coast.”

Paramedic Munzer, 43, said he was stuck at home in Sweida, unable to respond to calls for help.
“Entire families have been decimated. I know a family of four who were killed in their home,” he said.
“The bombardment didn’t stop all night,” said Munzer, also declining to provide his surname. “We have nothing left to eat in the fridge, just some dry biscuits, and some fruit and vegetables that have gone bad because the power has been cut off for 48 hours.
“I have four children, but I don’t know how to protect them.”

But the hardest thing, according to Munzer, is being unable to do his job as a paramedic.
He said he had received more than 50 calls for help and was worried about the “catastrophic situation” in the city’s main hospital, where he usually works.
An AFP correspondent in the city saw men wearing defence ministry uniforms, some with their faces covered, launching mortars near the bodies of two Druze fighters, as other combatants went house to house carrying out searches.
The city of some 150,000 residents was deserted, and shops were closed.
Another AFP correspondent saw on Wednesday some 30 bodies on the ground, including government forces and fighters in civilian clothes whose affiliation was not immediately clear.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, more than 300 people have been killed since fighting erupted on Sunday between Druze fighters and Bedouin tribes, sparking government intervention, and Israeli strikes in support of the Druze.
Most of the dead are fighters, but they also include 40 civilians, 27 of them summarily executed by security force personnel, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
The Syrian presidency on Wednesday condemned “heinous acts” and vowed to punish those responsible.

Now the persisting furore over files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein has forced Trump into an unfamiliar role: trying to shut a conspiracy theory down.
Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, was facing federal charges of sex trafficking minors when he died by suicide in jail in 2019. He had pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed after his death.
The saga burst back into the news last week after the Trump administration reversed course on its pledge to release documents it had suggested would reveal major revelations about Epstein and his alleged clientele. That reversal has enraged some of Trump’s most loyal followers.
To contain the fallout, Trump and White House officials are weighing a range of options, including unsealing new documents, appointing a special prosecutor and drafting executive actions on issues such as pedophilia, according to two White House sources with knowledge of the matter.
Trump and senior aides have also reached out to key MAGA-aligned influencers, urging them to dial down their criticism of the administration’s handling of the Epstein investigation and shift focus to broader priorities for the America First movement, one source said.
The backlash over the Epstein case has laid bare tensions inside Trump’s coalition and is testing one of Trump’s most enduring political strengths: his ability to command loyalty and control the narrative across the right.
The outcry comes amid discontent among parts of Trump’s base over the US strikes on Iran, continued involvement in Ukraine and any hint of backsliding on the administration’s hardline immigration promises.
The two sources said the intra-party friction was damaging to the coalition and that the White House was actively trying to restore unity, though they did not expect the Epstein controversy to dent Trump’s core support.
 
 

Many conservative influencers and hard-right media figures remain unconvinced by a Justice Department memo last week that concluded there was “no incriminating client list” or any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.
The review also confirmed prior findings by the FBI that concluded that Epstein killed himself in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and that his death was not the result of a criminal act such as murder.
Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During the 2021 trial of Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier’s longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, testified that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane multiple times.
Trump has denied ever being on the plane and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
That history now complicates Trump’s response, as he works to reassure a base steeped in long-running suspicions about Epstein and his connection to influential figures.
Trump backs Bondi
Trump has defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against calls for her firing by some MAGA personalities. He has urged his supporters to move on from the Epstein saga.
“I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case is of interest to anybody,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s pretty boring stuff. It’s sordid, but it’s boring, and I don’t understand why it keeps going.”
Both White House sources said there were mistakes in how information about the Epstein files was shared with pro-Trump influencers, especially by Bondi, who had previously implied that a list of Epstein’s clients existed.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment, and Bondi did not answer questions on Tuesday about Trump’s comments on the Epstein files at a press conference.
When asked if she expected to keep her job, she said, “I am going to be here for as long as the president wants me here — and I believe he’s made that crystal clear.”
In a statement on Tuesday, the White House said Trump’s law-and-order team remains focused on “Making America Safe Again” and “restoring the integrity of our criminal justice system”.
 
 

While some prominent voices outside the administration are falling back in line, others are not.
Charlie Kirk, a key MAGA influencer who had amplified doubts about the Epstein probe, abruptly reversed course after a call with Trump, one of the sources said. On Monday, Kirk posted on social-media platform X: “I’m done talking about Epstein. I’m gonna trust my friends in the government.”
 






Trump’s call for critics to back off is not landing everywhere.
Podcast hosts, including Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Tim Dillon, whose large audiences are not necessarily pro-Trump but broadly anti-establishment and helped propel his election victory, are unlikely to let up, according to Angelo Carusone, president of the progressive nonprofit watchdog group Media Matters for America.
“Trump seems very disconnected from the zeitgeist that put him into power in the first place,” Carusone said.
Some of Trump’s staunchest political allies are also keeping the pressure on. House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, called on Tuesday for the Justice Department to release more Epstein documents.
Representative Lauren Boebert, a hardline MAGA supporter, made her own demand on X: “We deserve the truth about the Epstein files. I’m ready for a Special Counsel to handle this.”

Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was banned from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban on operating to Europe was lifted in November last year.
Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.
“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.
“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”
In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.
 






Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.
“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have [sic] been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.
“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”
PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.
“It became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK’s Air Safety Committee.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the move, saying it will provide “ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold”.
“With over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today’s announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,” he wrote on X.
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the government had made concerted diplomatic efforts, in addition to technical and regulatory compliances, with the UK authorities on the matter to ensure the earliest possible lifting of the ban.
 






Reacting to today’s development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for “crossing another milestone”. “Three years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,” he said on X.
“The green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,” Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.
 






In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.
The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: “According to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.”
Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.
The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday launching e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
A day prior to that, the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
Asif assails PTI for PIA losses, calls for ‘fixing’ responsibility
Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK’s Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a “crime against state”.
He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost 40 per cent of the country’s pilots had fake licenses.
 


The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation’s image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.
“Imran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,” Asif quipped.
In reply to a question, he said Sarwar’s speech was “enough to fix responsibility” as the national flag carrier’s image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.
The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became dysfunctional and the pilots’ reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.
Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the “historic” day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.
The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.
US regulators to visit Pakistan: Asif
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Ke Saath’ later, Asif expressed hope that by September, Pakistani flag carriers would fly to the United States as well.
“God willing, in September, regulators are coming from the US,” Asif said. “We are hoping our flights will start going there and we will start talks soon. Hopefully, they will be successful.”
Recalling the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government’s pursuit of resuming the services of Pakistani flag carriers, the minister said that the foundation for PIA’s revival was laid by then-railway minister Khawaja Saad Rafique.
“Our regulator put in great efforts,” Asif said. “It was his competence, his international reputation and his contacts that made all of this possible.”
Asif expressed hope that PIA flights to the UK would be resumed by August 14.
“This is a success for our aviation industry as a whole,” he said. “Opening the aviation sector in Europe and the UK to us is a cause for happiness.”</p><small>2025-07-16 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614346-utility-stores-to-cease-operations-by-july-31-as-privatisation-moves-ahead' target='_blank'><strong>Utility Stores to cease operations by July 31 as privatisation moves ahead</strong></a><br><p>

Syrian government forces entered the majority-Druze city of Sweida on Tuesday with the stated aim of overseeing a ceasefire agreed with Druze community leaders following days of fighting with local Bedouin tribes.
However, witnesses reported that the government forces joined with the Bedouin in attacking Druze fighters and civilians in a bloody rampage through the city.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said that the violence in Sweida province since Sunday had left more than 300 people dead, including government forces, local fighters and 27 Druze civilians killed in “summary executions … by members of the defence and interior ministries”.
The Syrian presidency vowed to investigate the “heinous acts” in Sweida and to punish “all those proven to be involved”.

State media said a fresh ceasefire had been agreed, announcing “the deployment of security checkpoints” in Sweida city. A previous truce declared on Tuesday appeared to have had little effect on the ground.
The fighting was the most serious outbreak of violence in Syria since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and near Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.
The authorities have had strained relations with Syria’s patchwork of religious and ethnic minorities since they toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.
Israel, which has its own Druze community, has presented itself as a defender of the group, although some analysts say that is a pretext for pursuing its own military goal of keeping Syrian government forces as far from their shared frontier as possible.
Following Assad’s fall, the Israeli military took control of the UN-monitored demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of strikes on military targets in Syria.
Syrian state TV reported several Israeli strikes today near the army and defence ministry headquarters in central Damascus, with Israel’s army saying it had “struck the entrance of the Syrian regime’s military headquarters”.
 






AFP images showed the side of a building in the defence complex in ruins after the strike, as smoke billowed over the area.
Israel said it had also struck a “military target” in the area of the presidential palace in Damascus.
The Syrian health ministry said that at least one person was killed and 18 others wounded in the strikes on Damascus.
‘Existential battle’
Turkey, which has backed Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s administration, said “Israel’s attacks on Damascus … constitute an act of sabotage against Syria’s efforts to secure peace, stability and security.”
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called on Damascus to “leave the Druze in Sweida alone”, later threatening to unleash “painful blows” to “eliminate the forces that attacked the Druze until their full withdrawal” from Syria’s south.
Israel said it was sending more troops to the armistice line between the occupied Golan Heights and Syrian-controlled territory.
A military official said some troops would be redeployed there from the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s conflict against Hamas was in its 22nd month.
Dozens of people were crossing the heavily fortified Golan frontier, according to an AFP correspondent in Majdal Shams, a mainly Druze town in the Israeli-annexed area.
A military statement said Israeli forces were “operating to prevent the infiltration” from Syrian territory and to “safely return the civilians who crossed the border” from the Israeli-controlled side.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in February that southern Syria must be completely demilitarised, warning that Israel would not accept the presence of forces of the government near territory it controls.
The head of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, called the situation “an existential battle for the Druze community”.
Abuses ‘must stop’
Sporadic gunfire continued to ring out in Sweida today, an AFP correspondent reported before the latest ceasefire was announced.
The correspondent counted the bodies of around 30 combatants, some in plain clothes and some in military uniform.
The Observatory, witnesses and Druze armed groups have said government forces took part in fighting alongside the Bedouin against the Druze.
The Syrian defence ministry accused “outlaw groups” of attacking its forces inside the city, saying they are now “continuing to respond to the sources of fire”.
The Bedouin and the Druze have been at loggerheads for decades, with the latest violence triggered by the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant, the Observatory said.
Since they toppled Assad in December, Syria’s authorities and their allies have been repeatedly accused of not doing enough to protect the country’s religious and ethnic minorities.
The United States, a close ally of Israel, was “talking to both sides, all the relevant sides on this and hopefully we can bring it to a conclusion, but we’re very concerned”, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
US President Donald Trump’s administration asked Israel again to halt strikes on Syria and engage in dialogue with the government in Damascus, Axios correspondent Barak Ravid reported, citing a senior US official.
Neither Axios nor Ravid said whether that request came before or after Israeli strikes on Syria’s military headquarters and near the presidential palace in Damascus.
 






France said that “the abuses targeting civilians, which we strongly condemn, must stop”, while the European Union urged “all external actors” to “fully respect Syria’s sovereignty”.
Germany criticised the airstrikes, urging Tel Aviv to refrain from actions that could destabilise the country, Anadolu reported.
The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also condemned the attacks on Damascus in the “strongest terms”, Al Jazeera reported.
In a statement, GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said the air campaign represented a “flagrant violation” of Syria’s sovereignty, “a breach of international laws and norms, and a serious threat to regional security and stability”.
Albudaiwi reiterated the GCC’s support for Syria’s territorial integrity, adding that the continuation of the repeated Israeli attacks had constituted an “irresponsible escalation” and disregarded international efforts to achieve stability in Syria and the region.
He also called for international action to stop the “serious violations, hold the perpetrators accountable, and work diligently to protect the Syrian people and preserve its sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law”.​</p><small>2025-07-16 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614337-pakistans-2024-polls-rigged-to-silence-millions-ptis-bukhari-tells-us-panel' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's 2024 polls rigged to silence millions, PTI's Bukhari tells US panel</strong></a><br><p>

The new planetary system is forming around the baby star HOPS-315 — which resembles our own Sun in its youth — 1,300 light years from Earth in the Orion Nebula.
Young stars are surrounded by massive rings of gas and dust called protoplanetary discs, which is where planets form. Inside these swirling discs, crystalline minerals that contain the chemical silicon monoxide can clump together.
This process can snowball into kilometre-sized “planetesimals”, which one day grow into full planets.
In our home Solar System, the crystalline minerals that were the starter dough for Earth and Jupiter’s core are believed to have been trapped in ancient meteorites.
Now astronomers have spotted signs that suggest these hot minerals are starting to solidify in the disc surrounding HOPS-315, according to a new study in the journal Nature.
“For the first time, we have identified the earliest moment when planet formation is initiated around a star other than our Sun,” lead study author Melissa McClure of Leiden University in the Netherlands said in a statement.
The minerals around the star were first spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope. Then the astronomers used the European Southern Observatory’s Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile to find out exactly where the chemical signals were coming from.
They discovered that these minerals are in a small portion of the disc, which is similar to the asteroid belt that surrounds our Sun.
This will allow scientists to watch the process that may have birthed our home planet.
“We’re seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,” said study co-author Merel van’t Hoff of Purdue University in the US.</p><small>2025-07-16 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614331-indian-backed-terrorists-martyr-army-major-in-balochistans-awaran' target='_blank'><strong>India-backed terrorists martyr army major in Balochistan's Awaran</strong></a><br><p>

On Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which is expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former prime minister’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’, with PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later expressing her reservations over this announcement.
“Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” Imran’s post read.
“My instruction is firm: whether a senior officeholder or a junior member, no one is to express internal differences on social media, electronic media, print media, or any other platform,” he added.
“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances,” Imran continued.
He called upon the party to focus exclusively on the protest movement so that fundamental human rights are restored in Pakistan.
“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from within jail.”
Malik was conspicuous by her absence at the press conference by KP CM Gandapur. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, she questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Raja.
The dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats dealt a serious blow to the PTI, which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran’s messages.
Earlier in June, as the KP government passed the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of the PTI founder, his sister Aleema Khan claimed that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.
Speaking to the media, Aleema had said that if KP CM Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.
Later, she clarified that she meant that the government, not his party, was trying to isolate her brother.
“Minus Imran Khan, is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?” she had said.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.</p><small>2025-07-16 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16162642446a714.jpg?r=162658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924584/28-killed-across-punjab-in-rain-related-incidents-over-last-24-hours-rescue-official' target='_blank'><strong>28 killed across Punjab in rain-related incidents over last 24 hours: rescue official</strong></a><br><p>At least 28 people were killed and 90 others injured in rain and storms across Punjab in the past 24 hours, provincial rescue service spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said on Wednesday.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and replenishing water supplies and agriculture. They are crucial to the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In the last 24 hours, roof collapses killed 12 people in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, three in Sheikhupura, two in Okara, and one each in Pakpattan, Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal, according to the spokesperson.
Those seriously injured in rain-related roof and wall collapses across Punjab were immediately transported to the hospital, the spokesperson added.
PDMA issues Jhelum River flood warning
The PDMA has issued a flood warning for the Jhelum River, reporting that “exceptionally high” flooding ranging between 350,000 to 450,000 cusecs of water was expected upstream at Mangla. It also warned that associated nullahs of the river may attain high level flooding in the next 24 hours.
Addressing the high death and injury tolls across Punjab today, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the injured were being provided with “the best medical assistance”, adding that assistance would also be provided to the families of the deceased.
The DG requested citizens to take precautionary measures in view of the rainy season to avoid loss of life and property.
Citizens were requested not to live in old mud houses, as the highest number of deaths were recorded due to roof collapses in dilapidated buildings and houses.
“Take care of children and never let them near electric wires, poles, or low-lying areas,” he added.
This year, 77 civilians were killed and 214 injured due to monsoon rains, according to a Punjab PDMA spokesperson, who added that 74 houses were affected and six livestock killed due to the rains.
Monsoon rains recorded in most districts of Punjab in last 24 hours
Sheikhupura recorded 217 millimetres of rain, Okara 170mm, Sahiwal 80mm, Chichawatni 130mm, Hafizabad 90mm and Kasur 85mm of rain in the last 24 hours, according to a PDMA spokesperson.
Additionally, maximums of approximately 170mm of rain were recorded in Lahore, 60mm in Faisalabad, 32mm in Mandi Bahauddin and 29mm in Jhelum. Rains were also recorded in Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Mianwali, Multan, Gujarat, Layyah, Sargodha, Rajanpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Toba Tek Singh.
More rains are forecast in Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Multan, DG Khan and Bahawalpur divisions. This series of monsoon rains will continue till July 17, according to the PDMADG , who directed all the relevant departments to remain alert.
The PDMA spokesperson added that rains are expected to continue in Punjab today.
“There is a possibility of heavy rains in the upper reaches of rivers, including Lahore,” he said, adding that the PDMA’s provincial control room and district emergency operation centres were alerted.
Heavy rain and wind are expected in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Jhelum, Attock, Chakwal, Murree, Galiat, Mianwali, Narowal, Gujrat, Sialkot, Toba Tek Singh, Mandi Bahauddin, and DG Khan.
The PDMA said that there is a risk of flooding in rivers and canals in low-lying areas due to heavy rain, which poses a risk of landslides in the mountainous areas of Murree.
“Tourists and travellers should be extremely cautious during the forecast period,” it said, adding that citizens should also take precautionary measures.
Citizens are directed to call the PDMA helpline, 1129, in case of civil emergencies.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/161919511e2feb2.jpg?r=193203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924604/evidence-so-far-shows-humaira-asghars-death-accidental-or-due-to-natural-causes-police-report' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence so far shows Humaira Asghar’s death accidental or due to natural causes: police report</strong></a><br><p>Evidence so far shows that actor Humaira Asghar’s death was accidental or due to natural causes, according to a police investigative report released on Wednesday.
Last week, police formed a special investigation team to probe the actor’s death, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment on July 8.
According to the report by South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “Evidence so far suggests no signs of foul play or suicide.
“Circumstances indicate a possible accidental or natural cause of death while she was engaged in household chores.”
The report added that the double-locked door and the presence of all keys inside support the conclusion of no third-party involvement. There was also no evidence of physical assault, struggle, or weapon marks as per the initial post-mortem report.
The final confirmation of the cause of death awaited toxicology, chemical analysis and forensic findings, according to the report.
“A foul smell was reported by neighbours in December 2024. In January, the owner and building staff visited the apartment but did not detect anything substantial,” the report read.
The balcony door and window were found open and that likely allowed the smell to disperse.
The report continued that no one followed up further due to the assumption that she was out of town, as Humaira had a pattern of extended absences, and the owner of the apartment she had rented had already filed an eviction case and chose not to engage with her personally.
According to the digital and forensic analysis conducted by the police on Humaira’s personal devices and mobile phones, the last day of recorded outgoing activity was on October 7, 2024, when she contacted 14
individuals.
“The last known communication was around 5pm, strongly suggesting she died later that same day on Oct 7,” the report said.
The police also alluded to a lack of surveillance and monitoring at the apartment building, as no CCTV cameras were installed inside or outside the building, and there was no lift operator or front security to monitor residents.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore last Friday following a sparsely-attended funeral.
 
 

An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed had confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
The notification calling for the formation of the investigation team had directed them to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1608070677b0813.jpg?r=174112' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924548/irans-envoy-to-pakistan-widely-respected-says-fo-after-fbi-adds-him-to-most-wanted-list' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s envoy to Pakistan ‘widely respected’, says FO after FBI adds him to most wanted list</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday stressed that Iran’s envoy in Islamabad, Reza Amiri Moghadam, was “widely respected” after the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) added him to its Most Wanted list for his alleged role in the 2007 disappearance and suspected abduction of retired FBI agent Robert A. “Bob” Levinson.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the ambassador of Iran is widely respected for his role in the promotion of Pakistan-Iran relations,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told Dawn.com in response to a request for comment on the matter.
“He is entitled to all the privileges, immunities and respect due to [being an] ambassador, that too, from a friendly neighbouring country,” Shafqat highlighted.
Levinson arrived on Iran’s Kish Island on March 8, 2007 and went missing the following day.
Notably, a 2013 Associated Press (AP) investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a spy mission by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. Levinson’s family had received a $2.5 million annuity from the CIA to stop a lawsuit revealing details of his work, AP reported.
In 2020, after the US concluded that Levinson had passed away “some time ago”, Iran said he had left the country “long ago” and that Tehran had no knowledge of his whereabouts, rejecting claims by his family of him dying in Iranian custody.
 
 

On Tuesday evening, the FBI’s Washington Field Office released ‘seeking information’ posters of three senior Iranian intelligence officials, whom it blamed for playing key roles in Levinson’s disappearance and in efforts to conceal Tehran’s alleged involvement.
While Pakistani authorities have not been linked to the incident, the case now has a direct connection to Islamabad through Moghadam’s diplomatic posting.
The FBI statement said Moghadam had previously headed the operations unit of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), adding that he reportedly oversaw agents operating across Europe during that time.
However, according to the Iranian foreign ministry’s website, Moghadam has worked as deputy of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council in foreign and international policy affairs.
Per the FBI, Moghadam was “suspected of supervising the operation that led to Levinson’s reported abduction and later taking part in the cover-up”.
The FBI’s move comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Iran.
The US, which had been in talks with Tehran since April 12 for a nuclear deal, joined Israel’s war with Iran on June 22, striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The strikes came after warnings by US President Donald Trump to attack Iran if it did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
A US intelligence assessment had even found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one” before the US military launched the strikes.
In the wake of the FBI’s move, Iran denounced recent arrests of more than 100 Iranian nationals residing in the US during anti-immigration raids, IRNA reported.
Meanwhile, Iran’s parliament said the country should not resume nuclear negotiations with the US until preconditions are met, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media.
The US periodically sanctions Iran and companies involved in trading Iranian oil, with the latest such move made on July 9.
 
 

In March, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned US sanctions that targeted its Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad, several oil tankers and commercial entities, Iran International reported.
Iran also strongly condemned the US government in February for imposing fresh sanctions on various individuals and entities for being involved in the sale of Iranian crude oil, terming the move as completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.
Two other Iran officials added to FBI’s list
In a statement, the FBI said the posters were released as part of an ongoing investigation into Iranian officials “who allegedly played roles in Bob’s abduction and Iran’s attempt to obfuscate its responsibility”.
The two other officials named were Taghi Daneshvar and Gholamhossein Mohammadnia.
The FBI claimed that Daneshvar, who it said had the alias Sayyed Taghi Ghaemi, was a senior MOIS counter-espionage officer who reportedly supervised Mohammad Baseri — another person in the bureau’s most wanted list — around the time Levinson disappeared.
Mohammadnia, the FBI said, was a senior MOIS deputy who served as Iran’s ambassador to Albania in 2016. He was expelled from Albania in December 2018 for allegedly “damaging its national security” — a move hailed by the US. The FBI claims he led efforts to shift blame for Levinson’s disappearance to a terrorist group in Balochistan.
“These three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob’s 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government,” said Steven Jensen, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.
 
 

“Bob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends and colleagues.”
In March 2025, the US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Moghadam and several others in connection with the case.
Images and a video showing Levinson in captivity surfaced in 2010 and 2011, but there has been no confirmed sighting of him since.
The FBI maintains that its investigation remains active as it seeks to identify further Iranian officials allegedly involved in the abduction.</p><small>2025-07-16 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614316-watch-motorcyclist-falls-into-pit-filled-with-rainwater-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Motorcyclist falls into pit filled with rainwater in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>

Chairing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad, the prime minister said the ministries demonstrating strong performance will be commended.
“From this year, we will determine key performance indicators for the ministries to evaluate their performance every two months,” he said, emphasising that enhancing ministries’ performance was ultimately about delivery and service to the nation.
 






Expressing satisfaction over the stock market touching record levels this week, the prime minister said that the development reflected the positive business sentiment and that collective efforts were being made for the economic growth of the country.
PM Shehbaz also expressed grief and sorrow over the loss of lives in recent monsoon rains across the country. He especially regretted the incident in Swat, emphasising the need to take effective measures in the future to prevent such incidents.
Mons­oon rains in Pakistan have been linked to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they started in late June, according to government figures released on Monday.
On Tuesday, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.
“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed,” according to a press release by the Presidency.
Last week, PM Shehbaz said that transforming the outdated system into a modern, digital and effective governance model is among the government’s top priorities, as economic development and prosperity are not possible without modernising the system to meet contemporary demands.
Cabinet approves 15pc increase in EOBI pensions
The federal cabinet approved a 15 per cent increase in pensions provided by the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), effective from January 1, 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
This increase will be funded from the institution’s own resources, according to APP.
The prime minister directed the formation of a cabinet committee to introduce institutional reforms in EOBI.
The committee will also deliberate on proposals to extend old-age benefits to the informal labour sector, including domestic workers, agricultural labourers, and other marginalised employment categories that have been previously overlooked.
These reforms aim to ensure that workers in these neglected sectors receive their due rights.
The cabinet also approved the initiation of necessary legal procedures regarding the draft of the Sea Carriage Shipping Documents Bill 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
On the recommendation of the Ministry of National Health Services, the cabinet approved a five-year extension of the exemption on the import of anti-cancer, cardiac, and life-saving drugs used in hospitals and related healthcare institutions.
These medicines are considered vital for saving human lives, and the exemption is intended to ensure their prompt availability.
These drugs will be available only in hospitals and authorised institutions, with a ban on open market sales. Import of these medicines will require prior approval from the relevant licensing authority.
The federal cabinet also endorsed the decisions made in the meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases held on July 2 and 3.</p><small>2025-07-16 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614299-10-injured-as-passenger-coach-targeted-by-gunfire-in-balochistans-kalat' target='_blank'><strong>Three dead, seven injured as passenger bus targeted in Balochistan's Kalat</strong></a><br><p>

Dar was on a three-day visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Tianjin on Tuesday. According to the Foreign Office (FO), Dar and Wang were scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the event.
The Foreign Office (FO) said in a post on X: “The two leaders held wide-ranging discussions on key areas of mutual interest, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and multilateral cooperation.”
 






According to Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN, the top diplomats reaffirmed their mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests.
“China is ready to work with Pakistan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push forward the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” said Wang.
“China will strengthen strategic dialogue with Pakistan, jointly build [CPEC] with high quality, deepen cooperation in fields such as agriculture, industry and mining, and plan celebratory events marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year.”
Wang also echoed China’s concerns about the safety of Chinese nationals working in Pakistan, but stated that Beijing supported Pakistan’s efforts in counter-terrorism and “expressed belief that Pakistan will continue to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions”.
 






Meanwhile, the FO said in its post on X that Dar congratulated Wang on successfully hosting the meeting and conveyed his gratitude to the Chinese government for its hospitality.
“It was a pleasure to engage in meaningful discussions with my counterparts on the sidelines of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers, covering a broad spectrum of regional and multilateral issues of shared interest,” Dar said in a post on his own X account.
 






“Pakistan fully supports China’s preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Tianjin Summit and looks forward to further deepening the all-round cooperation between the two sides,” Dar said, according to CGTN, adding that he pledged efforts to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Pakistan.
“Pakistan adheres to the one-China principle and supports China on issues concerning its core interests,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-16 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614268-pakistan-china-reaffirm-commitment-to-regional-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China reaffirm commitment to regional cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to Dawn.com, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, “The two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.”
The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.
Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.
“Weapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,” according to the spokesperson.
Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.
He saluted the “sacrifices made by the brave sons” of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.
Naqvi vowed that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”.
“KP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,” he noted.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.
On June 21, KP Police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
On June 3, terrorist attacks on two police stations in KP’s Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-07-16 09:32</small></div><hr>
