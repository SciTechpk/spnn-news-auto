ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Monday rene­wed their commitment to permanent peace in South Asia, underlining that frie­ndly relations with neighbouring countries formed a core part of both nations’ foreign policy.
The reaffirmation came during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian at a reception hosted at the Sa’dabad Palace in Tehran.
The meeting took place during the prime minist­er’s official visit to Tur­k­iye, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, aimed at expre­ssing gratitude to fri­endly Muslim nations for their support during the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
Both leaders resolved to enhance cooperation to boost bilateral trade and investment and work together to maintain peace and security in the region.

Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan came out of the crisis with India as victorious because of the “brave actions of our outstanding armed forces, strongly supported by the people of Pakistan”.
He added, “We want peace and will work for peace in the region thro­ugh talks on the table and resolve our outstanding iss­ues, including the Kash­mir dispute, according to the United Nations Secu­rity Council resolutions, which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India.”
He said Pakistan is ready to talk for the sake of peace on different issues, including water, trade and counterterrorism, “if India is serious”. However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.
 


“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.
Stressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”
PM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.
“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.
Israeli actions condemned
Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.
“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.
He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.
The Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
President Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.
“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.
He said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.
“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.
He said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.
“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.
PM meets Khamenei
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz made a courtesy call to Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.
 






According to the PM Office, the prime minister briefed the supreme leader about the recent conflict with India and its hegemonistic and revisionist designs. He thanked the Iranian leadership for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression.
The premier underlined that Pakistan always desired peace to prevail in the region leading to economic development and prosperity.
Prime Minister Shehbaz briefed the supreme leader about the steps taken to elevate Pakistan-Iran ties to highest levels and maintained that his government was committed to further deepening strategic cooperation with Iran in the complex geopolitical times.
He praised the farsightedness of the Iranian leadership in pursuing the nuclear negotiations with the United States and hoped that a constructive deal would be reached between the two countries.
The supreme leader appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in promoting regional peace and stability and praised his commitment to further strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties. The supreme leader also prayed for greater prosperity, growth and development of Pakistan and its people.

• Head of  US-backed aid group quits
• Only 4.6pc of Gaza land now ‘arable’
• German chancellor says he no longer understands Israeli army’s goal
GENEVA: The Palestinian delegation won the right to fly their flag at the World Health Organisation (WHO) after a symbolic victory in a vote on Monday that its envoy hopes will lead to greater recognition within the UN and beyond.
The proposal, brought by China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and others, at the global agency’s annual assembly in Geneva passed with 95 in favour and four against — Israel, Hungary, Czech Republic and Germany — and 27 abstentions.
In apparent reference to the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Lebanon’s delegate Rana el-Khoury said the vote’s outcome provided “a small ray of hope for the brave Palestinian people whose suffering has reached unbearable levels”.
Israel argued against the WHO resolution and called for a vote. Its main ally, the US, did not participate.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes across Gaza Strip, killing at least 52 people on Monday, 33 of them in a school-turned-shelter.
In Gaza City, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that an early-morning Israeli strike on the Fahmi Al-Jarjawi school, where displaced people were sheltering, killed “at least 33, with dozens injured, mostly children”.
Images shared widely on social media showed what appeared to be badly burned bodies being pulled from the rubble.
Israel’s military claimed the building was being used as a centre by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to plan and organise attacks.
Farah Nussair said the school was sheltering “civilians, children, elderly, women, and men — just the tired ones who needed food and water”.
“We fled to the south, they bombed us in the south. We returned to the north, they bombed us in the north. We came to schools …. There is no security or safety, neither at schools, nor hospitals — not anywhere,” she said, a child in her lap.
Another strike killed at least 19 people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, Bassal said.
Aid group’s chief quits
The development came as the head of a US-backed foundation set to supply aid in Gaza quit unexpectedly on Sunday, a day before the group was due to begin operations.
Jake Wood, executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation for the past two months, said he resigned because it could not adhere “to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”. The foundation has been boycotted by the UN and the groups supplying aid to Gaza before Israel imposed a total blockade on the enclave in March.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which would use private contractors working under Israeli security, said it would begin deliveries on Monday, with the aim of reaching one million Palestinians by the end of the week.
The Switzerland-registered foundation will screen families for involvement with Hamas, potentially using facial recognition technology, according to aid officials.
While the aid system is being worked out, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday under five per cent of Gaza’s farmland is usable due to war, further exacerbating the risk of famine.
By the end of April, more than 80 per cent of the farmland was damaged and 77.8pc was no longer accessible, leaving barely 4.6pc of potentially arable land, according to a new satellite assessment released by FAO. Some 688 hectares (1,700 acres) is all that remains for cultivation, according to the assessment.
Israeli official dismisses truce proposal
As Israel continues its atrocities, Hamas has agreed to a proposal by US special envoy Steve Witkoff for a Gaza ceasefire, a Palestinian official close to the group told Reuters on Monday.
The new proposal, which sees the release of ten hostages and 70 days of truce, was received by Hamas through mediators. “The proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,” the source said.
The proposal also sees the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, including hundreds of those serving lengthy prison terms.
However, an Israeli official dismissed the latest ceasefire proposal from Hamas on Monday, saying no responsible government could accept such an agreement and rejecting the assertion by Hamas that the deal matched one proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed that Hamas was not interested in a deal.
European nations continue to pressure Israel to end the war with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday, saying he now “no longer understands” Israel’s objective in war-ravaged Gaza. “Honestly speaking, I no longer understand what the Israeli army is now doing in the Gaza Strip, with what goal,” Merz told public broadcaster WDR.

The decision was taken in a meeting of ADB Director General Bruno Carrasco-led delegation with Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordi­nation Dr Musadik Malik and other officials.
Pakistan’s climate resilience and environmental sustainability agenda was discussed.
 
 

During the meeting, both parties emphasised the importance of a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to tackle the pressing challenges of climate change.
The discussion focused on youth-led climate initiatives by providing necessary support in terms of preparation, mentorship and funding. Both sides recognised the potential of such initiatives to not only contribute meaningfully to climate solutions but also position themselves competitively on the global innovation landscape.
The meeting also explored avenues for joint ventures in climate financing and investments, with the goal of mobilizing substantial resources towards sustainable development.
Mr Malik highlighted the need to transition from planning to implementation, assuring ADB of his full cooperation and commitment throughout all stages to ensure that agreed outcomes are achieved effectively.
The potential for partnerships in carbon credit markets was also deliberated upon, with both sides agreeing to explore viable mechanisms for monetizing environmental performance and emissions reductions.

• Claims every possible support to be made available for armed forces
• Privatisation drive to be ‘accelerated’ in next fiscal year; PIA, three Discos to be privatised by year end
• Flags population growth, climate change as existential threats
ISLAMABAD: Promising simplified tax returns for the salaried class, Finance Minister Muhammad Aura­ng­zeb on Monday pledged that the up­co­ming federal budget would int­ro­duce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction and make available whatever support is required by the armed forces.
Talking to journalists after an event organised by the Pakistan Banks Association and Karandaaz Pakistan, the finance minister said that every possible support would be provided to the armed forces, stressing that it was a national need in light of recent cross-border aggression, not just a military requirement.
Responding to a question, he said the IMF mission and its regional dir­e­ctor, Jihad Azour, and executive dir­ector, Bahador Bijani, had retur­ned after concluding the mission in Islam­abad and completing discussions on the broad contours of the budget.
The discussions would continue virtually this week on a few new things that might crop up from Pakistan’s side or from their side, but a lot of support was available from the IMF, he said.
Mr Aurangzeb said the IMF app­roved Pakistan’s first biannual rev­iew and additional financing strictly on merit because all structural and qualitative benchmarks had been completed. He noted that Pakistan’s resolve to stay the course played a key role in overcoming challenges, including attempts to derail the IMF board meeting and create problems.
Responding to a question on budget delay, the minister said the country’s leadership had prioritised expressing gratitude to friendly nations who stood by Pakistan amid heightened tensions with India. Budget finalisation would resume upon the leadership’s return.
Earlier, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakis­tan’s turnaround story for macroeconomic stabilisation had received glo­bal appreciation. He said an equally strong message from friends and development partners was to stay the course and that was also the government’s commitment to move ahead with structural reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public finance.
He said it was easy to go for a sugar rush and pump liquidity in the system, but that was a well-known route the country had treaded multiple times before and landed in a balance of payments crisis as Pakistan is an import-dependent economy. He promised to resist that temptation to break the boom-and-bust cycle.
Simpler tax returns
The minister said the taxation reform was now led by the private sector and the purpose was to minimise human interaction through people, process and technology and address theft, leakage and corruption through transparency.
He said the government would ensure simplified tax returns and forms for the salaried class. He said that around 70 to 80 per cent of salaried people did not hold equity and fixed-income portfolios.
“They receive salaries through bank accounts with tax deducted at source. They should not have to fill in 140-150 data points,” he said, adding that the government aimed to reduce that number to just nine — five for wealth tax and four for income tax.
The minister conceded that 24 state-owned enterprises transferred to the Privatisation Commission last year did not go well. However, he said the process would now be accelerated, with transactions involving Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), three power distribution companies and some financial institutions expected to reach completion by the end of this year.
Mr Aurangzeb said debt servicing was the single-largest expenditure on the public finance side, and therefore, the government would have to ensure fiscal discipline to reduce borrowing and thus curtail debt servicing costs.
While the Debt Management Office is being restructured, he emphasised that its goal should go beyond reducing interest payments and instead help create economic value — or “alpha” — to put the economy on a sustainable growth path.
“That is where we are going to bring very bold measures in the coming budget to give strategic direction where the economy is headed” and change the DNA of the economy and not to just give an account of expenditure and revenue, Mr Aurangzeb said.
However, he warned that population growth and climate change were existential threats already impacting the country. Therefore, the government was also engaged with development partners and the IMF to support adaptation policies, he added.

Clashes broke out in Moro last Tuesday when police attempted to disperse demonstrators protesting the controversial construction of new canals on the River Indus. Protesters, organised by the Sindh Saba and armed with sticks and rods, blocked the Moro bypass road and clashed with police.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar’s house was also attacked, along with two trailers on Moro bypass road. A deputy duperintendent of police (DSP) was among the wounded.
According to a notification, the committee, chaired by Sindh West Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irfan Ali Baloch, will comprise Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh of the Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell, Benazirabad SSP Shabbir Sethar, DSP CIA Hyderabad Iftikhar Buriro and sub-inspector Naik Mohammad.
“The investigation of FIRs lodged will run parallel as a criminal case investigation”, the Sindh IG told Dawn.com when contacted for confirmation.
“The facts in this case are scattered, therefore, this committee is [being] formed,” he added. “Besides ascertaining the facts leading to [the] May 20 incident, it will evaluate [the] police response to the situation and fix responsibility, suggesting and recommening remedial measures to prevent such untoward incidents in [the] future.”
HRCP ‘deeply alarmed’ by Moro situation
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “deep alarm” about the situation in Moro and the casualties and injuries among demonstrators and the police.
“The burial of a deceased political activist under police supervision, as well as subsequent arrests and charges of sedition against protesters and their families, are gravely concerning,” the commission wrote on X.
“While HRCP does not condone violence by any actor, the disproportionate use of force by the police and criminalisation of dissent is unlawful. We demand an immediate, impartial inquiry into these incidents.”
 






On Sunday, the body of Irfan Leghari, who was killed in the violence in Moro, was buried in Mohammad Shah graveyard instead of his ancestral graveyard under a judicial order.
Leghari’s funeral was performed by police in the absence and without the consent of his family members and close relatives. Leghari had been shot during the police action and ensuing clashes.
Family members and relatives reacted angrily when police escorting the coffin-carrying ambulance arrived in the Leghari Bijarani village, in Sanghar district, late on Friday evening.
They said they would not accept the body from the police, who they said killed their loved one and also tortured and rounded up many of their community members at the demonstration.
Leghari’s heirs insisted that all those detained during and after the protest be released and cases against them withdrawn. Additionally, they demanded the resignation of the Sindh IG and DIG, as well as the registration of an FIR to investigate the incident.</p><small>2025-05-26 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26222409be4e7f2.png?r=222505' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913463/bilawal-calls-out-pti-govts-cowardice-as-peshawar-police-crack-down-on-ppp-protesters' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal calls out PTI govt’s ‘cowardice’ as Peshawar police crack down on PPP protesters</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari assailed the PTI-run Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday for its “harsh police response” to a protest by PPP workers and supporters in Peshawar against corruption, calling out the administration’s “cowardice”.
PPP protesters on Monday staged a protest in Peshawar against corruption in the province. In a statement posted on X, the party alleged that the protesters faced shelling and violence at the hands of the police.
In response to the situation, Bilawal took to X and posted a statement calling out the KP government, stating that they had “demonstrated cowardice” by attacking unarmed party workers.
 






PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwala also condemned the alleged incident in the statement. He was quoted as saying, “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government tried to cover up its failures by suppressing public protests with force.”
He added, “Shelling and violence against peaceful activists shows the government’s desperation.
“PPP workers are certainly unarmed and peaceful, but they are not helpless. Every attempt to suppress our voice will fail.”

Last week, PPP expressed serious concern about the reports of massive corruption in KP and announced to hold a protest rally against the provincial government on May 26.
The party’s provincial president Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha had also accused the PTI government of widespread corruption and administrative collapse in the province.
PTI protest fails due to low attendance
Separately, PTI provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar Khan expressed anger over the “failure” of the party’s protest in Peshawar.
The protest was staged against drone strikes in the tribal districts of KP, the party wrote on X.
However, it ended shortly due to the low attendance of party workers, MNAs and MPAs.
No MPAs from Nowshera and Mohmand districts participated in the protest. Only MPA Arif Ahmad Zai from Charsadda attended the protest.
The provincial president was also angry when the workers and supporters did not come out in large numbers.
Due to a low number of protesters, Akbar left without making a speech.
Earlier this month, Akbar handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party. The development came after PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar to resign from the position and focus on provincial matters.</p><small>2025-05-26 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26231520b3bd5eb.jpg?r=231536' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913331/situationer-battle-with-india-to-resume-at-diplomatic-front' target='_blank'><strong>Situationer: Battle with India to resume at diplomatic front</strong></a><br><p>• High-level team due in NY to counter Indian lobbying, Bilawal likely to head delegation
• Indian team led by Tharoor is already in US, assailing Trump’s role in truce
A HIGH-LEVEL Pakistani delegation is arriving in New York next week to present Islamabad’s position on the ongoing dispute with India as an Indian parliamentary team is already in the United States to step up its own lobbying campaign.
The Pakistani delegation currently includes Federal Minister for Environment Musadik Masood Malik, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Bushra Rahman, Khurram Dastagir, former ambassadors to Washington Jalil Abbas Jilani and Sherry Rehman. The group is expected to arrive in New York on June 1.
PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto- Zardari is scheduled to lead the delegation. However, with the possible addition of two new destinations to the itinerary, the final list of participants is still being finalised. There is also a possibility that Pakistan may send two separate delegations — one to Europe and another to North America, including Canada — with the PPP chairman likely to lead one of them.
While in New York, the delegation is scheduled to meet United Nations Secretary General António Guterres and the current president of the UN General Assembly. They will also address a meeting of permanent representatives to the UN.
 
 

From New York, the delegation will travel to Washington on June 3, a day after the US Congress resumes its session following a post-budget recess. Meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the National Security Adviser are being arranged.
Additional engagements include discussions with senior lawmakers, think tank scholars, and media representatives. The delegation will stay in Washington until June 6.
Meanwhile, the Indian delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is already in the United States as part of a wider tour that includes visits to Guyana, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil.
Tharoor, a former senior UN official, began his campaign with a speech at the Indian Consulate in New York, where he criticised US President Donald Trump’s claim that he had negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
 
 

President Trump has faced criticism from Indian officials and political circles for contradicting New Delhi’s claim that the ceasefire was negotiated by India at Pakistan’s request. Islamabad has already dismissed this claim as inaccurate. Since the ceasefire was announced on May 10, President Trump has issued five statements clarifying that it was the United States — not India — that negotiated and ensured the implementation of the ceasefire.
India has also expressed displeasure over Trump’s repeated public statements that the Kashmir issue requires resolution and that he is willing to mediate. New Delhi has consistently rejected “any notion of third-party mediation”.
In a widely circulated video, Tharoor, without naming Trump, remarked that he has “had the great honour of meeting four or five American presidents,” who had “a certain political heft, statesman-like gravitas, and intellectual quality that I find woefully lacking in this gentleman”. The comment drew laughter from the audience.
Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of several books on Pakistan’s military, commented on the Indian position while talking to Dawn, saying: “India has a longstanding position on no third-party involvement. But it doesn’t show any inclination towards engagement.”
Nawaz also noted that the United States and certain Arab states were involved in behind-the-scenes peace efforts. “Pakistan can benefit from behind-the-scenes pressure by the US and Arabian Peninsula governments to begin dialogue. But it must insist on a broad agenda and a deadline for agreement.”
Joshua White, a former National Security Council official and now a professor at Johns Hopkins University, also spoke to Dawn, saying it is unclear whether President Trump “personally played any role” in bringing about the ceasefire. However, “he is eager to take credit for solving problems, even if the manner in which he does so strains ties with the United States’ allies and partners.”
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, said President Trump views himself as the ultimate dealmaker and peace broker, “so it’s not a surprise he’d want to publicly project himself as having been front and centre in the talks that led to the end of a dangerous confrontation”.
Noting India’s sensitivity to third-party involvement, Kugelman added: “Unlike during previous cases of US mediation, Trump essentially broadcast it to the world, which naturally didn’t go down well in Delhi.”

The ATC allowed the police to conduct the polygraph (lie detection) and photogrammetric (facial and voice analysis) test on May 14. The former prime minister, however, refused to undergo them.
Last week, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari had assailed the PTI founder for refusing the tests, saying that he either made excuses such as being asleep or eating or claimed that his lawyers were unavailable. She remarked that it appeared he had still not come to terms with being a convict serving court sentences in jail, and stressed that “he needed to understand he was in Adiala Jail, not at his Bani Gala residence.”
During today’s hearing, the police submitted a report to the judge about Imran’s refusal to take the test, arguing that the investigation could not be completed without the results.
Legal Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Javed Ahmed said, “The PTI founder has refused to conduct the polygraphic and photogrammatic test. He has refused to take the written test twice … [and] the oral test three times.
“We have to perform the polygraph and photogrammetry tests for the purpose of our investigation,” he stated.
The DSP told the court that police would cooperate with Imran, but stressed that he needed to cooperate with investigating officers, too.
“Justice will be seen,” he added.
The court ordered that the PTI founder take the tests and demanded that the results be submitted by June 9.
Imran, 71, has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail for two years upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.
Imran’s sentences in the Toshakhana references were suspended while he was acquitted by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in the cipher case in June. An Islamabad district and sessions court had also recently accepted the appeals filed by Imran and his spouse against their conviction in the Iddat case.

The party has since launched several mass protests demanding his release, notably a march to Islamabad on November 26, 2024, where a day of pitched battles between security forces and PTI protesters ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.
In a post on X, PTI Senator Ali Zafar wrote that the party would be mobilising nationwide after having a six-hour discussion with the ex-premier today.
“Some very important matters were discussed. Amongst them was a countrywide movement for which the party should prepare and be well-organised,” the senator wrote.
Zafar warned that according to Imran, “there is no room for anyone in PTI to play both sides, and everyone must stand united for the cause of truth and justice.”
Quoting Imran, Zafar wrote, “I am bearing all the hardship in jail for the sake of the nation, and PTI leadership should not be scared of sacrifice.”
He did not give a date for when this movement is set to take place.
 






Meanwhile, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also spoke to reporters outside the Adiala Jail about the mass mobilisation, though she too did not give a date for when the movement would take place.
“Imran Khan issued instructions to get the party ready,” Aleema said. “He said ‘I will not call anybody to Islamabad, since they (authorities) sit with sniper rifles and people get shot … it brings me great pain, I will not do this.’
“Imran Khan has said that the party should get ready, as he will announce a mass movement across Pakistan soon,” she added.

Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Zaman Shah told Dawn.com, “A man, a woman and her three-year-old daughter were killed by her husband in a suspected ‘honour’ killing incident in the Dadband area of Upper Dir.”
He said that the suspect allegedly killed a man who was said to be a herbalist and used to visit houses for treatment in the area.
He said, “[The suspect] was said to be mentally ill and worked as a labourer in Islamabad,” adding that he had come to the village a few days earlier and left his wife and daughter at home with his uncle.
The official added that initial information revealed that the herbalist went to the uncle’s home where the incident occurred.
“The suspect shot dead the herbalist with a pistol outside the house and then he went inside, killing his wife and daughter,” Shah said, adding that the police launched an investigation into the matter.
Shah also said that ‘honour’ killing cases had soared in recent years, but no one lodged a complaint with the police in most cases.
“The state is the one lodging a first information report (FIR) but the suspects often get relief from the court,” he added.
 
 

In Pakistan, honour killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Last month, a woman and her 16-month-old daughter were allegedly gunned down by her relative for ‘honour’ in KP’s Mansehra. In an FIR, the victim’s mother-in-law said that the motive behind the double murder was that her son had married the woman.</p><small>2025-05-26 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2622214880b1cc8.jpg?r=222335' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913465/over-180m-users-passwords-login-credentials-stolen-in-massive-data-breach-says-national-cyber-security-body' target='_blank'><strong>Over 180m users’ passwords, login credentials stolen in massive data breach, says national cyber security body</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Emergency Response Team (PKCERT) on Monday issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures.
According to the advisory, seen by Dawn.com, PKCERT identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed usernames, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to services from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Instagram [and] Snapchat, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the advisory read.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added. “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, with no encryption or password safeguarding.”
 
 

PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites, among other potential threats.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised access to business and government accounts; and malware deployment using existing email and password combinations,” the advisory warned.
PKCERT advised users to change their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication on all of their online services, particularly on financial and administrative accounts.
“Use unique, complex passwords for every online service, avoid storing passwords in emails or unprotected files [and] consider a password manager to securely handle account credentials,” the advisory recommended.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
“Timely action is essential to limit the impact of this massive credential breach and prevent subsequent compromise of systems and identities,” it wrote, urging people to change compromised credentials, enforce multi-factor authentication and educate users on the risks of data breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investiga­tion Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), told the Interior Ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million citizens had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.
Sources told Dawn.com that the JIT, headed by a senior officer of the Federal Investigation Agency and comprising representatives from various intelligence agencies, had completed its probe and subsequently submitted a report to the ministry.
The JIT found that Nadra offices in Karachi, Multan and Peshawar were allegedly involved in the data leak and recommended action against various officials.</p><small>2025-05-26 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26193239816b37d.jpg?r=202000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Ready to talk with India,’ PM Shehbaz says during meeting with Iranian President in Tehran</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue and water security, during his visit to Iran.
The PM is currently on a four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent military escalation with India.
Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was received Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace in the Iranian capital, where he received a guard of honour.

Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.
“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.
The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.
“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.
 


The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.
“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.
“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.

“We are ready to talk, for the sake of peace on water issues with our neighbour,” he continued. “We are ready to talk to promote trade and also, counter-terrorism if they’re serious.
“But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory … like we have done a few days ago,” he added. “But if they accept my offer of peace, then we will show that we really want peace, seriously and sincerely.”
Later on Monday, the PM visited Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to PTV News.
“The Prime Minister briefed [Khamenei] about recent conflict with India and … profusely thanked [the] leadership of Iran for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X. “The Prime Minister underlined that Pakistan always desired that peace could prevail in the region, leading to economic development and prosperity.”
PTV News added that Khameini appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in “promoting regional peace and stability with farsightedness” and praised his personal commitment to further strengthening ties between both nations.
 






Earlier, the broadcaster reported that the PM touched down at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport on Monday afternoon, where he was received by Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moqadam, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran Mudassar Tipu, and senior diplomatic officials.
 






“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi, Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi are part of the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister on his visit to Iran,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X.
The PM and his delegation will also meet Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei “to discuss bilateral matters as well as important regional issues”.
During a two-day visit to Turkiye on Sunday, he had a delegation-level meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, where he thanked Turkiye for their support during the recent conflict and discussed bilateral trade and investment between the two nations.
PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz was seen off by senior Turkish officials at Istanbul Airport today.
“Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Guler, Deputy Governor of Istanbul Ilker Haktankacmaz Burhan Kayaturk, President of the Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association, Yousuf Junaid, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Turkiye, Numan Aslam, Consul General in Istanbul, senior Turkish government officials, and Pakistani diplomats stationed in Turkiye saw off the Prime Minister at Istanbul Airport,” PTV News said in a post on X.
 






“The purpose of the Prime Minister’s visit was to thank the people of Turkiye, and especially President Erdogan, for their strong cooperation and support in the recent tensions between Pakistan and India,” the post added.</p><small>2025-05-26 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2621413434de51d.png?r=214341' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913462/just-joking-macron-denies-dispute-with-wife-blames-disinformation' target='_blank'><strong>‘Just joking’: Macron denies dispute with wife, blames disinformation</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron denied Monday having a domestic dispute with his wife Brigitte after a video appeared to show her shoving his face away when they touched down for a visit to Vietnam, blaming disinformation campaigns for trying to put a false meaning on the footage.
The Elysee had been hoping that the visit to Vietnam would showcase France’s reach into the Indo-Pacific, but it has been shadowed by the incident which occurred as the doors of the presidential plane swung open after landing in Hanoi Sunday.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

This is the third time this month that Macron has been the subject of viral video footage at a time when France says it is being targeted by repeated disinformation attacks as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine.
It was falsely claimed that Macron took cocaine on a trip to Kyiv alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and images also emerged purporting to show Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dominate the French leader in a handshake.
Brigitte sticks out both her hands and gives her husband’s face a shove, according to footage shot by The Associated Press news agency.
The French president appears startled but quickly recovers and turns to wave through the open door. But with most of her body hidden by the aircraft, it is impossible to see his wife’s facial expression or body language.
“My wife and I were squabbling, we were rather joking, and I was taken by surprise,” he said. Now it’s “become a kind of planetary catastrophe, and some are even coming up with theories,” Macron told reporters.
‘Calm down’
Macron testily referred to the other incidents, including the images shot on a train to Kyiv where some accounts falsely claimed he shared cocaine with Merz and Starmer.
But the object Macron removed from the table when the media entered was a tissue. Erdogan, meanwhile, was filmed holding the president’s finger at a summit.
“For three weeks … there are people who have watched videos and think I shared a bag of cocaine, that I had a fight with the Turkish president, and that now I’m having a domestic dispute with my wife,” said Macron. “None of these are true. Everyone needs to calm down.”
After the incident in Hanoi, the couple proceeded down the staircase for the official welcome by Vietnamese officials, though Brigitte Macron did not take her husband’s arm when he offered it.
The video circulated rapidly online, promoted particularly by accounts that are habitually hostile to the French leader.
Macron’s office initially denied the authenticity of the images, before they were confirmed as genuine. A close associate of the president later described the incident as a couple’s harmless “squabble”.
‘Nothing more’
Referring to the past incidents, Macron said: “In these three videos, I took a tissue, shook someone’s hand and just joked with my wife, as we do quite often. Nothing more.
“We have loads of accounts, anonymous or not, whose frustrations are going to their heads, including news commentators who said this morning that I have the diplomacy of a beaten man,” he added.
He emphasised that all three videos were “completely authentic”, but the meanings attached to them were not.
Vietnam is the first stop on Macron’s almost week-long tour of Southeast Asia where he will pitch France as a reliable alternative to the United States and China. He will also visit Indonesia and Singapore.
The relationship between Macron, 47, and his 72-year-old wife has long been a subject of fascination at home and abroad.
She was a drama teacher and he a pupil when they met at a private school in their hometown of Amiens in northeast France. A mother of three children, Brigitte divorced her husband and began a relationship with Macron while he was in his late teens.

In a statement, the CCD elaborated that the police conducted an operation and recovered the woman in the Mani Yazman area, while also arresting four men allegedly involved in the kidnapping.
The statement added that a case was registered against them and the suspects were wanted by the Saddar Dunyapur police.
“The accused were absconding for nine years and the recovery of the kidnapped woman was a challenge,” the police spokesperson said in the statement.
The spokesperson added that the suspects were arrested after stringent efforts of the IT team and the Dunyapur Circle police team. The suspects were included in the list of top 100 declared fugitives.
“The police are not negligent in their duties and are determined to ensure the safety of the public, the statement quoted the CCD director of operations as saying.
The statement concluded that action will continue against criminal elements and proclaimed offenders.
Meanwhile, Lodhran CCD Public Relations Officer Adnan Tahir, describing the motive behind the kidnapping, told Dawn.com:  “The suspect wanted to marry the victim but her family had married her off to someone else.”
He added that the suspect, along with his accomplices, kidnapped the woman from her husband’s house.
“Following the incident, a kidnapping case was registered against them,” Tahir said.
In March, police arrested two youths for kidnapping and gang-raping a 14-year-old girl in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district.
According to a recent report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), each day in Pakistan in 2024 brought with it an average of 67 kidnappings, 19 rapes, six domestic violence cases and two honour killings, with conviction rates hovering at an appalling 0.5 per cent for honour killings and rape, 0.1pc for kidnapping, and a mere 1.3pc for domestic violence.
Per the report, the highest number of rape cases against women, totalling 532, were reported in Lahore but only two perpetrators were convicted. The situation was also alarming in Faisalabad, Kasur, and other districts. The highest number of cases of kidnapping of women were also reported in Lahore, with 4,510 cases, but only
five perpetrators were convicted.
It further noted that Gujranwala topped the list of domestic violence cases, but no punishment was given in any of the cases.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26171019911c9a3.jpg?r=185251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913420/justice-mandokhail-questions-pti-joining-sunni-ittehad-council-as-sc-live-streams-reserved-seats-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Mandokhail questions PTI joining Sunni Ittehad Council as SC live-streams reserved seats case</strong></a><br><p>Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned the PTI’s decision to merge with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) during last year’s elections as the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB) heard review pleas against a ruling that had declared the main opposition party eligible for reserved seats.
In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had dismissed the review petitions on the first day of hearings.
The CB live-streamed its proceedings for the first time today, after accepting the SIC’s application for it last week. The hearing was live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel.
The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
 


During today’s hearing, Justice Mandokhail observed that it was not a political party that contested the elections but rather its candidates.
He further noted that the problem of reserved seats would not have arisen had the PTI-backed independent candidates not joined the SIC — a decision former premier Imran Khan’s party took after having its election symbol revoked by the SC just a month before the polls.
 
 

Senior counsel Makh­do­­om Ali Khan appeared on behalf of PML-N and PPP women candidates affected by the July 2024 ruling and concluded his arguments.
ECP counsel Sikandar Bashir Mohmand and PML-N lawyer Barrister Haris Azmat also informed the court that they had submitted their written responses. PPP’s Senator Farooq H. Naek said he would file his party’s response tomorrow. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow (Tuesday).
Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.
Justice Ayesha had formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.
 
 

In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.
The SIC, which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had requested the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had heard the original case.
However, the CB dismissed those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin observing that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Makhdoom began presenting his arguments, Justice Hilali wondered how the SIC could be eligible for reserved seats.
“How can independent lawmakers join a political party that is not in the parliament? Did SIC take part in the elections?” she asked, at which the PPP lawyer replied that the party had not participated in the polls and that even its chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza had contested as an independent candidate.

Justice Mandokhail then observed that the SIC was not eligible for reserved seats. “The Sunni Ittehad Council could have become a parliamentary party but it does not have the right to reserved seats.”
Makhdoom contended that lawmakers elected on the reserved seats had been denotified without any prior notice, at which Justice Mazhar pointed out that the SC had struck down the ECP notifications.
The lawyer reiterated that the affected lawmakers should have been alerted about it beforehand. He argued that the ruling did not address Article 255 of the Constitution, according to which “no election to a House or a provincial assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined” by a parliament Act.
Justice Mandokhail inquired how Article 255 was applicable in this case, highlighting that the matter pertained to reserved seats, which are to be allotted based on proportional representation in the parliament.
 
 

At Makhdoom saying that a complaint pertaining to a mistake in nomination papers should have been taken up before a tribunal, Justice Mandokhail observed that the case did not come under the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) jurisdiction if the lawyer’s arguments were to be accepted.
Makhdoom asserted that it was the SC’s responsibility to “correct a mistake” as any decision “contrary to the Constitution and laws would be defective”. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “If the majority of the judges deem that the ruling was correct and the review pleas are not, what would happen in that situation?”
At this point, Justice Bilal asked whether the PTI was a party to the case, wondering, “How can a party that is not a respondent [in the case] be given reserved seats?”
Makhdoom answered that such a political party could not get reserved seats. CJP Afridi also observed that the PTI was not a respondent in the case.
Here, Justice Mandokhail observed, “We also have to review the ECP’s role at the time. In my opinion, the ECP did not fulfil its responsibility. [While] allotting the reserved seats or not is an issue, the election commission’s role is also to be looked at.”
 
 

The judge stated that in his minority judgement, there was “no formula for a middle path”. He noted that he perused the available records all night, according to which 41 candidates had written PTI in their party certificate and affiliations.
Here, Justice Afghan observed, “The Constitution cannot be rewritten. Justice Mandokhail and Justice Afridi have also written that fulfilling the legal requirement of a timeline is mandatory.”
Makhdoom then contended that Article 178 of the Constitution had “no jurisdiction”. “Complete justice is a provision of the Constitution, under which the SC does complete justice on a dispute. The right cannot be used to provide relief to a third party that is not a respondent in the case,” he argued. Justice Mandokhail then quipped, “This is the Supreme Court, not a civil court.”
At Makhdoom giving a hypothetical situation of a dispute between a landlord and a tenant, the judge replied that matter would be of a personal nature and stressed that the current case was about the “people’s right to vote”.
As Makhdoom quoted a judgement by CJP Afridi, Justice Mandokhail pointed that the top judge had called for the SC’s right to provide complete justice to be used with caution.
At one point, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “A political party does not end by not having an election symbol. A political party does not contest elections but its candidates do.
“An election symbol is for the public’s awareness. Someone cannot be stopped from running for elections due to not having an election symbol.”
The judge further noted, “If the independent candidates had remained in the PTI instead of joining the SIC, this issue would not be there today. If the SIC had contested the elections on its party symbol, then also the issue would not have arisen.”
 
 

The judge further said the presiding officers had not formulated Forms-33 correctly, while Makhdoom contended that the apex court had not taken up the reserved seats case within its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) but as an appeal.
Here, Justice Hilali reiterated her earlier question: “I am having trouble in understanding this. The SIC could not win even a single seat. Its chairman Hamid Raza himself did not contest elections from his party. [Moreover], the PTI was not even a party to the case. How can then reserved seats be given to it?”
The affected legislators’ lawyer responded saying that the use of the “allegiance to the Constitution” in the original SC verdict seemed “emotional”.
Justice Rizvi then inquired whether the PTI had challenged the ECP notifications in the PHC or ECP, to which Makhdoom replied in the negative.
Makhdoom urged the court to accept the review pleas, arguing that the “court could change its opinion in a review case”. Justice Mandokhail asked if it was possible for him to change his “decision in the reserved seats case”, to which the lawyer said, “Definitely, you can change your opinion.”
Makhdoom then concluded his arguments.
Noting that the opposing parties had submitted their written responses, SIC’s lawyer Faisal Siddiqui contended they had “lost their right to rebuttal”, at which Justice Aminuddin observed that it was upto the court to decide who had that right.
Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till Tuesday, with Siddiqui expected to present his arguments.
Tug-of-war over reserved seats
In its detailed verdict on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.
 
 

It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.
On September 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the 26th Amendment in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had reprimanded the ECP for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.
Later on October 18, in yet another clarification, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an amendment made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.
 
 

The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at circumventing the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.
A six-judge CB of the apex court was set to take up the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A separate plea of the PTI against the Jan 13, 2024 ruling denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26165244a7805fb.jpg?r=165310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913441/india-arrests-police-officer-suspected-of-spying-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India arrests police officer suspected of ‘spying for Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>In another incident amid a growing crackdown on alleged espionage, Indian authorities on Monday said they arrested a paramilitary police officer on charges of “spying for Pakistan” following a recent military confrontation between the two neighbouring countries.
The developments follow a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.  On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
 
 

Last week, Indian police arrested 10 people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation.
On Monday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) alleged a Central Reserve Police Force officer was arrested in Delhi “for sharing sensitive information with Pakistani agents”.
“The accused, Moti Ram Jat, was actively involved in espionage activity and had been sharing classified information related to national security with Pakistan Intelligence Officers (PIOs) since 2023,” the NIA alleged.
Jat has been remanded to custody until June 6 by a special court, the agency said, as investigators question him.
The spate of arrests comes after the worst flare-up in violence between the nuclear-armed rivals since their last open conflict in 1999.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi last week for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed “Operation Sindoor”.
The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll.
Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.
Meanwhile, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights reported that between April 27 and May 8, there were 184 anti-Muslim attacks of various sorts all over India.
They comprise 19 acts of vandalism, 39 assaults, 42 incidents of harassment and 84 incidents of hate speech. It’s believed that 106 were “triggered” by Pahalgam. The majority happened in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26172348eb022b6.jpg?r=182958' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913443/punjab-pdma-requests-govt-to-issue-rules-for-proper-solar-panel-installation' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab PDMA requests govt to issue rules for proper solar panel installation</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday requested the government to issue rules and guidelines for the proper installation of solar panels.
This development comes after heavy rains lashed several parts of Punjab on Saturday, resulting in multiple casualties. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others were injured across Punjab and KP following the severe weather. About two dozen incidents of the fall of solar panels and billboards were also reported.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia wrote separate letters to the Energy Department, Local Government Department and the Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners across the province, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
The letters said that 70 per cent of the “human losses were caused by the structural collapse of poorly installed solar panels/solar energy system or solar-related structures due to windstorm”.
It further said that there was an urgent need to “ensure that all solar installations — especially those on rooftops and open structures must be executed in a technically sound and weather resilient manner”.
The PDMA said that the installations must be “properly designed, structurally secure and approved by the concerned authorities”, urging the use of certified materials and mounting equipment as well as following recognised engineering standards.
“A thorough review of existing installations should also be carried out, with immediate corrective actions taken where necessary,” it said, adding that “appropriate maintenance and inspection protocols” must be developed and implemented regularly.
The authority requested a survey of any dangerous solar structures and address such cases, and stated, “Timely action will help protect lives, public infrastructure and support the long-term success of solar energy initiatives in Punjab.”
Pakistan became the largest importer of solar panels in the world by the end of 2024, British news outlet The Independent reported, citing the Global Electricity Review 2025 report by UK-based energy think tank, Ember.
“Amid high electricity prices linked to expensive contracts with privately-owned thermal power stations, rooftop solar installations in Pakistan’s homes and businesses soared as a means of accessing lower-cost power,” the report stated. “The country imported 17 GW of solar panels in 2024 to meet this growing consumer demand.”</p><small>2025-05-26 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/261757417787bee.jpg?r=182005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913452/ruet-i-hilal-committee-to-convene-to-sight-zilhaj-moon-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Ruet-i-Hilal Committee to convene to sight Zilhaj moon tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will meet tomorrow in Islamabad to sight the Zilhaj moon, state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
Earlier this week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”
The statement said that the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, meaning that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha is likely to be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
According to Radio Pakistan, Committee Chairman Maulana Syed Muhammad Abdul Khabeer Azad will preside over the meeting, while zonal Ruet-e-Hilal Committees will also meet separately at their respective headquarters for sighting of the Eidul Azha Moon.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-26 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26214617944a13d.jpg?r=214804' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913450/protests-grip-bangladesh-as-pressure-mounts-on-yunus-led-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Protests grip Bangladesh as pressure mounts on Yunus-led govt</strong></a><br><p>Primary school teachers in Bangladesh joined public sector workers in protests against the interim government on Monday amid growing discontent and political uncertainty in the South Asian country.
Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the country last August after deadly student-led protests forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.
Yunus’ administration has faced pressure from civil servants, teachers, political parties and the military as the caretaker government attempts to guide the country through a fragile transition before holding a general election.
The government issued an ordinance on Sunday allowing the Ministry of Public Administration to dismiss public servants for misconduct without lengthy procedures, sparking outrage across the bureaucracy.
Government employees continued their demonstrations for a third consecutive day on Monday, calling the ordinance “repressive” and demanding its immediate withdrawal.
Thousands of teachers in government primary schools also began indefinite leave from work on Monday, demanding a hike in wages.
In the face of protests by the employees of the National Board of Revenue, the interim government was forced on Sunday to withdraw an order to dissolve the tax body and replace it with two divisions under the finance ministry.
Political uncertainty also deepened last week after a top student leader said Yunus said he could step down if political parties cannot agree on reforms and an election timeline.
Wahiduddin Mahmud, the planning adviser in Yunus’ cabinet, however, said the de facto prime minister was not quitting.
“We are not going anywhere till our job is done,” Mahmud said during the weekend, adding that Yunus acknowledged the obstacles but remained committed to holding a fair election.
The interim government has been caught between competing demands for swift general elections and reforms. Yunus has said the elections could be held by June 2026, while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been pushing for polls by December.
Bangladesh’s army chief, General Wakeruz Zaman, added to the pressure by calling for elections to be held in December during a speech last week, expressing his dissatisfaction over the political situation.
Yunus convened a last-minute meeting of his Advisory Council on Saturday and also held talks during the weekend with the country’s main political forces, including the BNP, Jamaat-i-Islami and the student-led National Citizen Party.
Leaders of other political parties also met Yunus.
“We are in a war-like situation,” Yunus’ press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters on Sunday. “After the Awami League’s activities were banned, attempts are on to destabilise us in various ways. We have to get out of this situation.”
The registration of Hasina’s Awami League party was suspended this month, effectively barring the party from contesting the next election.</p><small>2025-05-26 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/261550226e72b2d.png?r=155451' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913432/former-sindh-governor-kamaluddin-azfar-passes-away-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh governor Kamaluddin Azfar passes away in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Former Sindh governor and veteran PPP leader Kamaluddin Azfar passed away in Karachi on Monday, according to his family and party officials.
PPP Sindh Secretary General Senator Waqar Mehdi told Dawn.com that Azfar had been admitted to Ziauddin Hospital, where he breathed his last.
Mehdi said Azfar’s funeral prayers would likely be decided after the arrival of his children from abroad.
Azfar was close aide of former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
He also served as PPP Karachi president and was once known as the “son of Karachi”.
The veteran leader was instrumental in constructing apartments for lower-income communities in Karachi’s Lines Area.
Azfar was a former senator and relinquished his senatorship when he was appointed Sindh governor in 1995 by ex-premier Benazir Bhutto.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed sorrow at Azfar’s demise, calling him a “wise politician.”
“Your political services will be remembered,” Murad said of Azfar,  who also held the post of finance minister, according to a statement from the minister’s office.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said she was “grieved” by Azfar’s passing.
“He served in many positions including Governor Sindh, and was a well known activist as well as politician from Karachi, who worked closely with Shaheed Benazir Bhutto on local government policies among other initiatives.
“Prayers for his family and loved ones in this moment of loss,” she said in a post on X.
 






The Karachi Literature Festival, which hosted Azfar as a speaker multiple times, called him a well-known lawyer, writer and political figure.
“Educated at Government College, Lahore, and Balliol College, Oxford, he was called to the Bar at the Inner temple, London.”
Upon returning to Pakistan, he established his law practice in Karachi.
“As a writer, Barrister Azfar has mostly written on issues concerning economics, history and politics. He was Research Assistant to Nobel Prize Winning Economist Gunnar Myrdal on his magnum opus The Asian Drama: 1960-63.
“His later publications have included The Chinese Synthesis (1975), Pakistan: Political and Constitutional Dilemmas (1987), an anthology titled Pakistan under the Military (1991), Asian Drama Revisited (1992), Good Governance (1994), Discovery of Pakistan (2005), and, most recently, Waters of Lahore (2014),” KLF said in a description on him.
Azfar has held key offices, such as Sindh minister for finance, planning and development, federal minister for local government and rural development, and special assistant to the prime minister.

“Something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said of the Russian president on Truth Social.
“I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”
Trump also criticised Zelensky, posting that the Ukrainian leader “is doing his Country no favours by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”
Speaking to reporters at the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said of Putin: “I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him? Right? He’s killing a lot of people. I’m not happy about that.” He raised the possibility of imposing more sanctions on Russia in response to the ongoing attacks.
The Kremlin on Monday said that US President Donald Trump’s claim that Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely CRAZY” might be due to emotional overload, but thanked the US leader for his assistance in launching Ukraine peace negotiations.
“We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organising and launching this negotiation process,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the Trump remarks about Putin.
“Of course, at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions.”
There was no immediate response Zelensky’s office on Trump’s remarks.
In the biggest aerial assault of the war, Russia pummeled Ukrainian cities and other targets with at least 367 drones and missiles overnight on Sunday, killing at least 12 people, including three children in the northern region of Zhytomyr, Ukrainian officials said.
 
 

The Russian attack was the largest of the war in terms of weapons fired, although other strikes have killed more people.
Trump has been pressuring Russia and Ukraine to end the more than three-year war, but the two sides remain far apart — and while major powers talk, the war is intensifying and Russian forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine.
Swarms of drones are being launched by both sides while fierce fighting is underway along key parts of the front.
The Kremlin says it is conducting what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine to protect Russia from Nato encroachment on its borders. Ukraine says Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.</p><small>2025-05-26 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606272-former-sindh-governor-kamal-azfar-passes-away-at-87' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh governor Kamal Azfar passes away at 87</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad, the finance minister said they were working on a “strategic budget” instead of “just making the math work”.
He said that the “DNA” of the economy had to change.
“And therefore we are going to bring some bold measures during the budget because the budget is not just about revenue and expenditure but has to provide the strategic direction where the economy is and where it is heading,” he said.
“So it’s our full effort to make this document more strategic, rather than just making the math work,” he said. “Of course, we have to make the math work.”
On debt servicing cost, he noted that it had gone down “by a trillion rupees”.
“And next year, what we are going to do, god willing, is to restructure and reorganise our debt management office along modern lines in terms of international best practices,” he said.
He observed that the country was heavily dependent on imports, leading to a foreign exchange issue and a balance of payment crisis.
“We go running back to the lenders as the last resort, the reason why we are in the 24th IMF programme … let’s be very clear about this because all of us have had enough boom and bust cycles,” he added.
In terms of structural reforms, he reiterated the government’s resolve to “stay the course” on the taxation side; people, process, and technology framework; and digitalisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
On the public financing side, the finance minister said, “Its important that whatever we are doing — including the rightsizing of the federal government — we are taking it in waves rather than a big bang approach and we will continue on that journey.”
 
 

Last year, Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, had said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.
Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.</p><small>2025-05-26 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26154546ceec100.jpg?r=155136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913437/india-races-to-contain-oil-spill-after-container-ship-sinks-off-kerala-coast' target='_blank'><strong>India races to contain oil spill after container ship sinks off Kerala coast</strong></a><br><p>India’s coastguard raced on Monday to contain an oil spill from a container ship with hazardous cargo that sank off the southern coast a day earlier, Kerala’s state government said.
The Liberian-flagged MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184 meter freight ship, went down off the coast of Kerala on Sunday, with all 24 crew members rescued.
It was carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide, a chemical used for fertiliser production and steelmaking. The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil.
“The Coast Guard is taking action to prevent the spread of oil using two ships,” Kerala’s government said in a statement.
“The work of spraying dust to destroy the oil is in progress using a Dornier aircraft”.

India’s defence ministry said the ship sank “due to flooding” some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, raising concerns for the “sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala’s coast”.
The government has put coastal areas on high alert and warned people not to touch or approach any containers — some of which have already washed up along the coast.
The ship was sailing between the Indian ports of Vizhinjam and Kochi when it ran into trouble on Saturday and issued a distress call.</p><small>2025-05-26 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606261-pakistan-railways-to-run-five-eid-special-trains-from-major-cities' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Railways to run five Eid special trains from major cities</strong></a><br><p>

The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 886.10, or 0.74 per cent, to stand at 118,216.57 from the last close of 119,102.67 at 1:13pm.
At 3:04pm, the index decreased by 642.92 points, or 0.54pc, from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “delay in budget announcement”, in addition to “lack of clarity” on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “conditions related to budget pushing investors to trim their exposure”.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is consolidating ahead of the budget, with pressure on the oil sector following media reports of disagreements with the IMF over the circular debt resolution plan and the onset of rollover week.”
“We expect a rerating to the upside once there is clarity on key budgetary measures,” he added.
The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “The market is concerned about delays in the release of circular debt payments to companies, as well as the potential rationalisation of tariffs in the upcoming budget.”
On a positive note, he highlighted the reduction in the primary surplus target to 1.6pc of GDP — down from last year’s 2.1pc.
He said that this was “expected to give the government some fiscal space to avoid imposing harsh new taxes, unlike the pattern seen over the past three years”.
“Although the room for significant relief is limited, we expect a relatively more people-centric budget, with emphasis on executing the comprehensive tax reforms initiated under the IMF programme over the last two years,” he said.
On Friday, the stock market had come under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.
Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.

The negotiations between Washington and Tehran aim to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and both sides have taken a tough stance in public over the issue of Iran’s uranium enrichment.
Asked about reports that Iran could freeze enrichment for three years to reach an agreement, spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told a press conference: “Iran will never accept that.”
Baghaei also ruled out the possibility of an interim nuclear deal with the US, dismissing media reports that a provisional agreement was being considered as a temporary step towards a final deal.
President Donald Trump said on Sunday that US negotiators had “very good” talks with an Iranian delegation over the weekend.
Iran is waiting for further details from mediator Oman regarding the timing of the next round of talks, Baghaei said.
“If there is goodwill from the American side, we are also optimistic, but if talks are aimed at curbing Iran’s rights then talks will get nowhere,” he added.
The stakes are high for both sides.
Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel.
Iran, for its part, maintains its nuclear programme is exclusively for civilian purposes and wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy.</p><small>2025-05-26 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606258-eid-ul-adha-ruet-e-hilal-committee-meets-tomorrow-to-sight-zil-hajj-moon' target='_blank'><strong>Eid ul Adha: Ruet-e-Hilal committee meets today to sight Zil Hajj moon</strong></a><br><p>

Karim was elected unopposed after the position fell vacant following the demise of former emir Professor Sajid Mir on May 3, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Hafiz Abdul Karim on his election and expressed his good wishes for the newly elected chief of the religio-political party.
The PML-N has nominated Hafiz Abdul Karim, who was earlier the secretary-general of JAH, as its candidate for the Senate seat which fell vacant after the demise of Prof Mir.
According to a PML-N press release, party president Nawaz Sharif offered the Senate seat to Prof Mir’s son, Ahmad Mir, but he declined the offer. The PML-N then nominated Karim for the vacant Senate seat.
Karim earlier served as a senator from March 2018 to March 2024 on a technocrat seat from Punjab. He was also a member of the National Assembly from June 2013 to 2018. Besides, he served as the minister for communication in the cabinet of then premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in 2017.
Notable religious and political leader Prof Mir passed away at the age of 86 earlier this month after a heart attack. He was laid to rest in his native Sialkot.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has announced the election for the vacant general seat from Punjab in the Senate on May 29.</p><small>2025-05-26 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606249-biek-delays-wednesday-exams-due-to-youm-e-takbeer' target='_blank'><strong>BIEK delays Wednesday exams due to Youm-e-Takbeer</strong></a><br><p>

On February 25, the finance ministry had announced it was considering “establishing a National Crypto Council” to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later appointed Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.
According to a press release issued today, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.
An MBE, which stands for “Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire”, is awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.
According to the statement today, this appointment reflected the country’s  “commitment to aligning with global trends”.
“Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies,” the statement read.
The press release also stated that the country stood at a “critical digital crossroads” — with it consistently ranking in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.
It noted Pakistan currently had 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion.
Additionally, it added that the “nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide”.
According to Saqib, “Pakistan’s unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technology—where blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.”</p><small>2025-05-26 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606229-travelling-to-mountains-make-sure-to-follow-these-safety-tips' target='_blank'><strong>Travelling to mountains?
