The precarious work of training AI, which generally pays just a few dollars, has sparked a movement for better wages and conditions stretching from Kenya to Colombia.
“You have to spend your whole day looking at dead bodies and crime scenes… Mental health support was not provided,” Kenyan national Ephantus Kanyugi told AFP.
Labellers “need to spend time with these images, zoom into the wounds of dead people” to outline them so they can be fed into the AI, the 30-year-old added.
Kanyugi, who has worked on image labelling since 2018, is the vice-president of the Data Labelers Association (DLA), an 800-strong labour group based in Nairobi.
The DLA plans to unveil a code of conduct this month aimed at major labelling platforms, calling for improved conditions for workers.
Kenya has no law regulating data-annotation work — like many countries around the world where millions of people are feeding digital information into growing AI models.
“We’re like ghosts. No one knows that we exist, even though we are contributing to society’s technological progress,” said Oskarina Fuentes, half a world away.
The 35-year-old Venezuelan works for five different data-labelling platforms from her home in Colombian city Medellin, earning between five and 25 US cents per task.
Such behind-the-scenes data work has exploded as generative AI has soared to become tech’s next big thing.
Invisible labellers’ toil has allowed self-driving cars to recognise pedestrians and trees, chatbots like ChatGPT to speak in natural-sounding sentences, and automated content moderation systems to remove violent or pornographic content from social media.
The data-labelling sector amounted to a $3.8-billion market in 2024 and is expected to grow to more than $17bn within five years, according to consultancy Grand View Research.

‘Modern slavery’
Creating new generative AI models will need human-verified data “for as long as it’s based on automated learning”, said Antonio Casilli, a sociology professor at France’s Institut Polytechnique in Paris who interviewed so-called “click workers” from 30 countries for a book on the sector.
Humans are required both to shape the inputs for generative AI models and to give feedback on the relevance and accuracy of the trained systems’ outputs.
Tech giants contract out this work to a plethora of different companies.
One of the largest, US-based Scale AI, recently secured a $14-bn investment from Facebook parent company Meta — which also hired away co-founder Alexandr Wang to lead its own AI efforts.
Scale’s clients include OpenAI, Microsoft and the Defense Department in Washington.
In his investigation, Casilli found that data labellers are generally aged between 18 and 30 and earn a low wage in relation to their level of education.
Most live in low-wage countries — although the sector is making inroads into America and Europe, where much higher pay is the norm.
As generative AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or competitor Anthropic’s Claude gain in capability, more specialised knowledge is needed to inform and judge their responses in maths, chemistry or less-common languages.
Scale AI’s subsidiary Outlier lists work for experts in biology, the Malay language spoken in Malaysia or computer coding in Spanish, with pay ranging from $30 to $50 per hour.
Another Scale AI subsidiary, Remotasks, pays labellers around one US cent for tasks that can take multiple hours — wages Kanyugi likens to “modern slavery”.
“People develop eyesight problems, back problems, people go into anxiety and depression because you’re working 20 hours a day or six days a week,” he said.
“Then despite working so many hours, you only get poor pay, and you might also not get paid.”

‘How to murder someone?’
Several legal cases have been filed against Scale AI in the US, with workers accusing the company of failing to pay them, reporting them as contractors rather than employees or exposing them to traumatising content without adequate safeguards, according to court documents seen by AFP.
Plaintiffs gave examples like being required to converse with an AI chatbot about topics such as “How to commit suicide?”, “How to poison a person?” or “How to murder someone?”
Scale AI declined to comment on ongoing court cases, but acknowledged to AFP that some of its work includes sensitive content.
The company added that workers are always warned in advance of such topics and can break off a task whenever they choose.
Scale AI added that it offers workers mental-health resources and an anonymous support hotline.
And it said it makes its pay bands clear, offering equal or better hourly rates than the minimum wage in the countries where it operates.
Generative AI is not the first arm of the tech sector to face complaints over exposing low-paid contractors to disturbing content.
Moderators working for Meta in several countries, from Spain to Kenya and Ghana, have brought legal action against the company over working conditions and alleged psychological harm.

Cut off
Most of the people labouring to fine-tune data for AI are in precarious working relationships that can be severed from one day to the next.
Fuentes said one of her employers failed to pay her around $900 she was owed for three months’ work after an update to its payroll software.
“I wasted my time, my energy and my sleep,” she said.
Fuentes could not name her former employer because of a non-disclosure agreement she signed, a common practice in the industry that constrains many workers from speaking out.
Kenya’s DLA is weighing legal action against Remotasks, which data labellers say suddenly cut off their access to the platform in March 2024 without paying salaries that were due.
Remotasks’s parent company acknowledged it had reduced its footprint in Kenya, but said it closed labellers’ accounts for infringements of its internal rules.
Workers had been paid for all completed tasks, the company insisted.
Microsoft and Meta declined to comment to AFP on their relationships with Scale AI. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.
Anthropic, which collaborates with data labelling startup Surge AI — itself the target of legal action in the US — said it requires its subcontractors to follow rules on wellbeing for workers dealing with sensitive content.
It added that it requires pay rates for data labellers of $16 per hour or higher.
Meanwhile OpenAI said it has strict rules for its own subcontractors on workplace safety, fair compensation, non-discrimination and respect for workers’ rights.
The ChatGPT developer added that it takes appropriate action for breach of contract if those stipulations are not met.
Showdown
Working as freelancers or on short contracts, most data labellers nevertheless enjoy none of the protections of employees, sociologist Casilli said, calling them a “digital underclass”.
In Kenya, the DLA is pushing for a code of conduct that would include an employment contract guaranteeing “equitable pay”, free association, the right to take breaks and psychological support in case of exposure to harmful content.
Such demands can turn into a showdown between workers and tech companies.
In the United States, almost 250 people were fired in September from their jobs at GlobalLogic, a subcontractor helping train Google’s Gemini generative AI, after several complained about pay discrepancies and called for improved working conditions.
“They just want docile annotators” said 31-year-old Andrew Lauzon, who worked for GlobalLogic from March 2024 until he was fired on September 12.
Boston native Lauzon had joined the Alphabet Workers Union — named in reference to the Google parent company — to campaign for conditions such as sick leave, paid time off and affordable health care.
GlobalLogic declined to comment when contacted by AFP, while a Google spokesman said that “as the employer, GlobalLogic is responsible for the employment conditions of their workers”.
Google nevertheless says it expects subcontractors to treat workers fairly and respectfully, adding that it imposes a code of conduct and carries out regular audits.

‘Loopholes’
A study on AI’s hidden workforce published by UNI Global Union this month showed that “Big Tech cannot build the future on disposable labour,” its general secretary Christy Hoffman said in a statement.
“It’s time to hold Silicon Valley titans accountable for conditions in their AI supply chains,” Hoffman added.
Workers’ struggles for rights and recognition remain hobbled by a lack of legal avenues.
Even Europe’s imposition of new AI regulations has left “loopholes”, European Parliament member Leila Chaibi of French hard-left party LFI told AFP.
“There’s no mention of click workers in the AI regulation,” she said, nor in the Platform Work Directive Chaibi helped push through Brussels in October 2024.
A European directive requiring companies to monitor human-rights compliance throughout their supply chains could be deployed in support of data labellers, Chaibi said.
But in practice, European Union member states have been calling the rule into question.
As governments wrangle, millions of people are working every day in the sector, which remains essential to improving the quality of generative AI responses.
“If you’re a carpenter or you’re a plumber, there are unions and there is a minimum wage,” said Nacho Barros, a 54-year-old from Spain’s Valencia who took up data labelling work during the coronavirus pandemic.
“This job should be recognised by the government of each country,” he insisted.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “From 13-15 October 2025, thirty-four khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in multiple engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The security forces, per the ISPR, conducted intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts of the province.
The first operation, it said, was carried out in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, eighteen khawarij were sent to hell,” it said.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in the South Waziristan district, during which eight more terrorists were neutralised following an intense exchange of fire with the security forces.
“In [the] third encounter, [which] took place in [the] Bannu district, own troops successfully neutralised eight more khawarij.”
The ISPR added that sanitisation operations were being carried out in the said areas “to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji”.
It further said that a “relentless counterterrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam — as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan (NAP) —  by security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of Pakistan, will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement, lauded the armed forces and security agencies for successfully carrying out the counterterrorism operations, saying that the “timely actions of the security forces have improved the peace and stability situation in the country.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for “thwarting the nefarious plans of the terrorists with their professional expertise.” In a statement, he said that all possible measures will be taken for the safety of the Pakistani people and the country’s integrity.
“The counter-terrorism campaign will continue with full vigour until the complete eradication of the menace of terrorism from the country,” he said.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
Last week, ISPR Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as of September 15, a total of 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025. During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
He added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives.
Lt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.”
On October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred.

The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, D.C., where Aurangzeb arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip.
A foreign ministry statement issued today said Aurangzeb continued a series of high-level meetings in the US capital, including his engagement with Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan.
“He apprised his Saudi counterpart of the ongoing privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports, underscoring the government’s resolve to attract strategic investments through transparency and efficiency,” it added.
 






The development comes after a parliamentary committee was informed last month that the PIA Corporation Limited was expected to be privatised by November this year. The national flag carrier’s privatisation is a key condition under the $7bn IMF bailout package approved for Pakistan.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Regarding the said bailout package, Aurangzeb reaffirmed during his meeting with Al-Jadaan that Pakistan remained steadfast in pursuing economic reforms under the IMF programme to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability, the finance ministry statement said.
It added that the two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Moreover, the statement said, the two ministers agreed that institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) could play a vital role in mobilising private sector investments in Pakistan.
“Aurangzeb also sought Saudi support for infrastructure development projects, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a deeper economic partnership with the kingdom,” it said.
In a post on X, Al-Jadaan said, “We further explored opportunities to deepen cooperation and discussed topics of mutual interest.”
 






Other engagements
Apart from meeting his Saudi counterpart, Aurangzeb also held other meetings on the day, the finance ministry statement said, adding that the “engagements focused on reinforcing Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms, exploring new avenues for international investment, and strengthening bilateral financial cooperation”.
In a key meeting with US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black, he “highlighted significant investment opportunities within Pakistan’s oil and gas, mines and minerals, agriculture, IT and pharmaceutical sectors”.
 






The finance minister also underscored the consensus at the leadership level to enhance trade and investment ties, welcoming the DFC’s interest in facilitating private sector-led funding for projects in Pakistan, the finance ministry statement said.
Separately, he also met Azerbaijan’s first deputy finance minister, Anar Karimov, reaffirming strong economic and strategic ties between the two countries, the statement added.
In the meeting, “he congratulated Azerbaijan on successfully hosting COP29 and highlighted the Pakistan-Azerbaijan Preferential Trade Agreement (January 2025) and Transit Trade Agreement (December 2024) as key platforms to diversify bilateral trade beyond oil and rice into textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and agricultural products”.
 






During his meeting with MIGA Executive Vice President Hiroshi Matano, Aurangzeb expressed “appreciation for the agency’s support in ongoing arbitration matters and reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding both investor confidence and national interests”.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb welcomed MIGA’s proposal for a short-term trade finance facility to ensure access to “critical imports” such as food, fertiliser, energy and essential machinery, and emphasised the importance of its timely implementation.
He also acknowledged MIGA’s continued support for Pakistan’s power transmission and distribution sectors, the statement added.
 






The finance minister also attended the Borrowers’ Forum Roundtable, where he discussed the “crucial balance between servicing high debt obligations and financing essential social sector investments”, the statement said.
At the meeting, he commended the establishment of the forum as a “valuable platform for collective action, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination among debtor nations”. The statement further said that he also stressed the importance of improved debt management, enhanced technical capacity and better access to sustainable finance for climate resilience and infrastructure development.
The minister also met with members of the Pakistan Bank Fund Staff Association (PBFSA), the statement said, adding that he briefed them on recent fiscal, monetary and external sector progress and referenced the country’s upgraded sovereign credit ratings.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, energy reforms, privatisation, social protection, and inclusive green growth while responding to participant queries.”
 






Later, the statement detailed, Aurangzeb held a “productive meeting” with the senior management of Standard Chartered Bank, acknowledging the long-standing partnership between the Bank and Pakistan.
“During the discussions, the minister highlighted the external validation of the country’s ongoing economic reforms by international rating agencies. He briefed the team on Pakistan’s recent Panda Bond issuance and plans to tap international capital markets through Eurobonds and International Sukuk.
“The meeting also covered trade financing facilities, with the minister requesting the bank to share additional proposals for consideration to further strengthen collaboration.”
 






Earlier in the day, the statement said, the finance minister attended a session of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (CFMCA), held discussions with British economist Stefan Dercon and participated in a media interaction with the Wall Street Journal.
He also addressed global investors at the Citi Macro Forum, where he, alongside the finance secretary and State Bank of Pakistan governor, presented a “comprehensive overview of the positive developments on Pakistan’s fiscal, monetary, and external fronts”.
He attributed the current economic momentum to effective stabilisation measures, structural reforms and prudent monetary management, noting the successful negotiation of a staff-level agreement with the IMF, the statement said.
It added that Aurangzeb subsequently joined finance ministers and central bank governors from the MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) region in a meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
 






As a lead speaker, he underscored “Pakistan’s achievement of macroeconomic stabilisation and welcomed the staff-level agreement with the IMF. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to advancing reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, and privatisation”.
Moreover, he highlighted Pakistan’s “digital transformation and tariff policy aimed at enhancing competitiveness and exports”, while inviting international investment in key sectors including mining, digital infrastructure, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, the finance ministry statement said.</p><small>2025-10-16 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16135808898572c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949319/phc-grants-protective-bail-to-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-till-nov-18' target='_blank'><strong>PHC grants protective bail to KP CM Sohail Afridi till Nov 18</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court on Thursday granted protective bail to new Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi till November 18.
After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar.
A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person.
During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister.
“We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court.
Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18.
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”.
Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”.
Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib,” he asserted.
Shortly after the hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases.
 






CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail.
 






Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi.

Its report comes after a US Coast Guard investigation in August outlined a litany of issues with operator OceanGate’s conduct, as well as design flaws in its Titan submersible, that led to a “preventable tragedy” in which all five passengers were killed.
“We found that OceanGate’s engineering process for the Titan was inadequate and resulted in the construction of a carbon fibre composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements,” NTSB’s report said.
“Because OceanGate did not adequately test the Titan, the company was unaware of the pressure vessel’s actual strength and durability, which was likely much lower than their target.
“Additionally, OceanGate’s analysis of Titan pressure vessel real-time monitoring data was flawed, so the company was unaware that the Titan was damaged and needed to be immediately removed from service”, after a previous dive, it added.
OceanGate chief executive Stockton Rush was joined on the doomed expedition by British explorer Hamish Harding, French deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Pakistani-British tycoon Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman.
Seats on the submersible cost $250,000 per person.
Communications were lost with the SUV-sized submersible about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive on June 18, 2023, kicking off a dramatic search that briefly captivated the world.
 
 

Debris was found a few days later on the ocean floor, about 500 meters from the bow of the Titanic, and human remains were recovered when the sub was brought to the surface.
Shortly after the tragedy, OceanGate halted all operations.
Last year, the family of Nargeolet sued OceanGate for $50 million, accusing the US-based company of gross negligence.
The wreckage of the Titanic sits 644 km off the coast of Newfoundland and has become a lure for nautical experts and underwater tourists since its discovery in 1985.
The ship hit an iceberg and sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from England to New York, with 2,224 passengers and crew on board. More than 1,500 people died.</p><small>2025-10-16 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16133503578c587.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949308/china-says-it-supports-pakistan-afghanistan-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>China says it supports Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>China supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire, its foreign ministry said on Thursday, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire.
China stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told a regular press briefing.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Office (FO) announced that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid recent border hostilities between the two countries.
 
 

“A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said.
Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”.
Pakistani officials on the northern and southern border with Afghanistan told AFP that “no violence was reported overnight, and the ceasefire remains in effect”.
Separately, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk welcomed the ceasefire and appealed to “both parties to prevent any further harm to civilians & commit to a lasting ceasefire,“ according to AFP.
The announcement came after the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul, state media PTV reported.
Earlier in the day, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said security forces repulsed a separate attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members.
It said Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
The fighting was the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following an incident in Kurram and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
Twenty-three Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 were injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border, ISPR said.
 
 

Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week.
For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself against terrorist groups such as the TTP.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/161341108a3015f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949307/afghan-man-on-trial-in-germany-over-deadly-knife-attack-on-toddlers' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan man on trial in Germany over deadly knife attack on toddlers</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan man accused of a deadly knife attack on a group of toddlers in Germany went on trial on Thursday, nine months after an incident that inflamed a heated pre-election debate on immigration.
Germany was shocked by the stabbing spree that killed a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man who tried to protect the children and left three others wounded in the southern city of Aschaffenburg.
Five toddlers from a kindergarten class were in a public park, accompanied by two teachers, when the assailant attacked them with a kitchen knife.
The suspect arrested at the scene of the January 22 attack has been only partially named, in line with usual practice by the German judiciary, as 28-year-old Enamullah O.
He has a long history of mental illness, and prosecutors said an expert assessment concluded his psychiatric state meant he was not criminally responsible.
The public prosecutor’s office has previously said there was no indication the suspect acted out of extremist or terrorist motivation, and they were seeking to have him permanently confined to a psychiatric facility.
The trial is expected to stretch over several days of proceedings in October.
The suspected attacker injured a two-year-old Syrian girl, one of the teachers, as well as a 72-year-old man who had also tried to protect the children.
He was arrested shortly afterwards, and it soon emerged that the authorities had tried and failed in 2023 to deport him to Bulgaria — the first EU country he had arrived in.
In August 2024, he allegedly threatened a fellow resident at an accommodation for asylum seekers in the nearby town of Alzenau with a butcher’s knife and caused her minor injuries.
The Aschaffenburg stabbings, which followed a string of other bloody attacks in Germany, provoked intense political reactions.
Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats who went on to become chancellor, promised a “fundamental” overhaul of asylum rules and strict border controls “from day one” if elected.
About a week later, Merz, then the opposition leader, relied on support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to pass a non-binding resolution through parliament demanding stricter immigration and refugee policies.
Merz’s decision to rely on far-right support broke a longstanding taboo in post-World War II German politics, prompting fierce criticism and mass street protests.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16114824aaaf0a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949295/punjab-govt-to-recommend-ban-on-tlp-following-violent-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt to recommend ban on TLP following violent protests</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government on Thursday said it will recommend to the federal government that a ban be imposed on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The development came as Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz chaired an “extraordinary meeting” on the province’s law and order situation, during which “historic decisions were made to establish the state’s writ and supremacy of the law”, a statement issued by her office said.
Without taking any names, the handout itself referred to decisions taken against an “extremist party”. However, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari confirmed to Dawn.com that the decisions made pertained to the TLP.
One of the decisions taken was that the Punjab government will “recommend the federal government to impose a ban on an extremist party”.
“The extremist party’s leadership will be placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act,” the handout said. The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 ATA.
 






“Individuals involved in hate speech, incitement and violation of law will be arrested immediately in Punjab,” the provincial government decided.
It was also decided that cases against “leaders and workers involved in the martyrdoms of police officers and damage to state property” will be tried in anti-terrorism courts (ATCs).
“All properties and assets of the extremist party will be handed over to the Punjab Auqaf Department. There will be a complete ban on the extremist party’s posters, banners and advertisements,” the CM Office statement added.
It further said that “all bank accounts” of the party will be frozen, and that its social media accounts “spreading hatred will be taken down”. The Punjab government also vowed “strict action on the violation of the Loudspeaker Act”.
The meeting also agreed upon a number of steps pertaining to the Afghan community residing in the province. This included bringing “Afghan citizens into the tax net” and preparing a real-time database of “illegal Afghan residents”.
“A whistleblower system will be introduced for illegal immigrants. The name of the informant will be kept completely confidential,” the CM Office statement said.
It added that the Punjab government has also decided to initiate a “combing operation against illegal residents and their businesses”. “Illegal immigrants will be immediately deported according to the federal government’s policy.”
The high-level security meeting also agreed to urgently recover illegal arms, with a “one-month ultimatum” issued by the Home Department for the owners to surrender their illegal weapons.
“Citizens should register their legal arms from a [Police] Khidmat Markaz within a month,” the handout read. The government also ordered that the stocks of arms vendors and dealers be inspected, and the issuing of licences for new ones would be completely banned.
According to the statement, the Punjab government also “recommended the federal government to regularise arms factories and manufacturers”.
 
 

The provincial administration also bolstered the punishment for those holding illegal arms to 14 years in jail, with a fine of up to Rs2 million, and made the offence non-bailable.
Today’s development follows a large-scale pre-dawn operation by law enforcement agencies on Monday to dismantle TLP’s protest camp in Muridke, which sparked violent clashes, widespread chaos, and multiple arrests. The party had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
As per the official figures, as many as 2,716 people have been arrested after the Muridke operation. Out of these, some 251 were taken into custody by Lahore police and 178 by Sheikhpura police. The government has also barred around 2,800 people from travelling abroad, according to Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
Even as police intensify their crackdown on the group following the events that transpired in Muridke, the authorities have decided to take a series of measures to “neutralise” the threat the TLP has posed to the law enforcers and non-Muslim communities since its inception.
The decision to put the radical outfit on a leash is being linked to some crucial meetings, where the TLP’s tainted record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, as well as ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship came under discussion.
Chaudhry, the minister of state for interior, has said action against the TLP protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of those involved in the May 9, 2023 riots, which led to a country-wide crackdown on the PTI.
The federal government had previously imposed a ban on the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
 
 

The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march to Islamabad.
Restrictions were also briefly imposed on the TLP in June 2023, when the party was carrying out a long march from Lahore to Islamabad. Restrictions lifted under an agreement reached on June 17, 2023 included a ban on the party’s coverage on electronic and social media.
Special prosecutors for cases against TLP in Lahore, Sheikhupura
Separately, the Punjab government has appointed special public prosecutors to represent the state in terrorism cases registered against TLP in the districts of Lahore and Sheikhupura.
According to an order issued by the Punjab government’s public prosecution department yesterday, seen by Dawn.com, Advocate Supreme Court Rana Shakeel Ahmed Khan and Advocate High Court Chaudhry Khalid Rasheed have been appointed as special prosecutors for all cases registered against the TLP “within the jurisdiction of Lahore and Sheikhupura districts/region”.
 
 

The appointments — notified following a letter by the Lahore deputy inspector general (DIG) legal for Punjab police chief Dr Usman Awan — were made under Section 18 of the ATA, which allows the government to appoint public prosecutors or law officers to Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs), a high court or the Supreme Court.
The special public prosecutors will coordinate with investigation officers, joint investigation teams for “efficient investigation, proper preparation of case files and represent the state before trial courts in all matters including remands, bails and trials etc; and Honorable Lahore High Court, Lahore (Principle Seat) in all matters, including bails, appeals, revisions, petitions for suspension of sentence, writs and other miscellaneous applications”.
Terms and conditions will be issued separately, the order stated.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/161343231fce7e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949291/15-of-a-family-dead-8-injured-as-truck-overturns-in-swat-rescue-service' target='_blank'><strong>15 of a family dead, 8 injured as truck overturns in Swat: rescue service</strong></a><br><p>At least 15 people were killed — all from the same family — when a Punjab-bound truck overturned in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district early morning on Thursday, according to a Rescue 1122 official.
Malakand Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul said in a statement, “At least 15 members of the same family were killed and eight others sustained injuries when a truck overturned near tunnel No. 3 of the Swat Motorway on Thursday morning.”
The dead and injured include men, women and children, she said.
“The family was from the Gabral area of the Bahrain tehsil and were travelling to Punjab when the tragic incident occurred,” the statement said.
Rescue teams rushed to the site of the incident and carried out relief operations alongside the Motorway police, according to the spokesperson. She further said that the injured had been taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Batkhela.
“Doctors at the hospital confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives,” she said, adding that four of the injured were in critical condition and had been referred to Swat.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, taking note of the incident, expressed “deep sorrow” at the loss of lives, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He vowed to stand in solidarity with the victims’ families, saying that “loss of life is an irreparable tragedy.”
The governor also “wished a swift recovery for those injured in the accident,” APP reported.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Last month, at least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan due to brake failure.
On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days before that, five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628856-phc-bars-authorities-from-arresting-kp-cm-afridi-grants-protective-bail' target='_blank'><strong>PHC bars authorities from arresting KP CM Afridi, grants protective bail</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan regularly holds joint military exercises with countries across Asia, the Middle East, and beyond to boost operational readiness, deepen defence cooperation, and improve interoperability. These engagements enable Pakistan to share counterterrorism expertise, reinforce alliances, and project itself as a balanced and responsible regional actor.
“Pakistan-Kazakhstan Joint Exercise Dostarym-V is being conducted between the armies of Pakistan and Kazakhstan in [the] counter terrorism domain from 13-24 October 2025 at the Special Operations School, Cherat, Pakistan,” a statement from the ISPR said.
“Special Services Group of [the] Pak Army and Special Forces of [the] Kazakhstan Army are participating in the exercise,” it added.
According to the statement, the opening ceremony of the exercise was conducted on Tuesday in Cherat.
The exercise is aimed at “refining professional skills through joint training and harnessing historic military-to-military relations among the friendly countries”, the statement said. “Participating troops are looking forward to [benefiting] from mutual expertise [and] experience.”
In April, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir made an official trip to Kazakhstan and held a meeting with the Defence Minister of Kazakhstan, Colonel General Ruslan.
The two leaders engaged in comprehensive discussions focusing on the dynamic regional security landscape, shared strategic objectives, and opportunities for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation.
They highlighted the significance of deepening military-to-military ties and reaffirmed their commitment to working together for the promotion of peace, stability, and security in the region.</p><small>2025-10-16 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628837-punjab-moves-to-ban-extremist-party-after-violent-tlp-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab moves to ban 'extremist party' after violent TLP protests</strong></a><br><p>

New Delhi neither confirmed nor denied it was shifting policy towards Russia.
“It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario,” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.
“Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”
 






Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously defended buying oil from Russia, a historic partner of India, despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Trump in August raised tariffs on Indian exports to the US to 50 per cent, with Trump’s aides accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy,” Jaiswal added. “This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions.”
India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
New Delhi traditionally relied on Middle East nations.
But since 2022, it shifted sharply toward discounted Russian crude, taking advantage of a buyer’s market created by Western bans on Moscow’s exports.
“Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement,” Jaiswal said.
“This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India.
Discussions are ongoing.”</p><small>2025-10-16 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1512085787bc5eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948626/the-assassination-of-liaquat-ali-khan-a-death-foretold' target='_blank'><strong>The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan — a death foretold</strong></a><br><p>I sometimes wonder if there have been any bleaker periods in our country’s history than the current times. But then I read or listen to some of our history, and realise that the quagmire we rest on is simply a build-up of years of lies, deceit and dastardly actions of a coterie of self-interests that have existed since independence. On this day, the 74th death anniversary of Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, the nation needs to rethink, reassess and reflect.
The facts surrounding my grandfather’s assassination have become clearer to me over the past few years. There remain some stalwart supporters of the first prime minister, who have undertaken extensive research, including from the period right after his assassination, and have come to their conclusions regarding where the blame falls.
 
 

Unfortunately, for this nation, the investigation and documentation of facts surrounding the conspiracy that was given to Nawabzada Aitzazuddin, the then Inspector General of Special Police, never saw the light of day. Aitzazuddin was travelling to Peshawar to meet PM Nazimuddin and update him on the results of the investigation when the military plane he embarked on mysteriously crashed. The documents aboard were apparently ‘destroyed’ too.
Such mysteries make it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction, blurring the lines between truth and lies, and effectively keeping them away from the heart of the matter.
Unresolved mysteries
A few years ago, BBC News Urdu ran a brief yet empathetic audio story on the assassination, informed by high-quality research and thoughtful insights. It revealed questions raised by Begum Ra’ana Liaquat Ali Khan on her husband’s first death anniversary, all of which remain unanswered to date.
 


She recalled that her husband was about to deliver an important policy announcement the day he was murdered, a speech that was not made public posthumously. Why, the Begum questioned.
She had more inquiries; why was her husband’s murderer killed on the spot, even when he had already been pinned down by people? And why was Mohammad Shah Gul, the sub-inspector who took down the murderer, given a promotion instead of a rebuke? Who actually were the high-level conspirators wanting Liaquat out of the way, and why?
And, finally, why were all of her questions still up in the air?
I am aware of the people whom my grandmother was convinced had a hand in her husband’s murder. None is alive today, and, from what I have heard, death didn’t come to them easily, each paying a price in their own way for their involvement in the conspiracy.
I am a firm believer in karma — our individual and collective actions result in reactions of equal weight across the spectrum of our own lives and of those closest to us. Notwithstanding those from within the government who participated, there is also sufficient circumstantial evidence to suggest that certain foreign interests were also at play.
The man who believed
I recently finished listening to a series of podcasts wherein US-based author Farooq Babrakzai — the younger son of Said Akbar, who assassinated Liaquat Ali Khan — was interviewed by journalist Haider Mehdi. Their interaction was based on Babrakzai’s recently published book ‘The Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan – A critical look at the early history of Pakistan’.
 


Apparently, while no Pakistani publisher was willing to publish the book, a publishing house in India consented. There is talk that there will be a book launch in Pakistan soon.
The interview is quite revealing, not only in the kinds of narratives being created and curated during the early period of our history, but also in how certain events are construed by the author. At some level, I do appreciate the thought and research put into the writing, solely on the basis of the podcast, because I have yet to read the book.
But it also leaves me deeply unsettled and pained over how people have a chance to better understand my grandfather’s killer, but not him. The ruling elite of the past 70 years has made it a mission to ensure that the public remains unaware of the level and depth of the sacrifices the Quaid-e-Millat made for his country and his people, both during his life and upon his death.
Thoughts of that fateful day keep passing through my mind. The podcast plays back the one minute of the live Radio Pakistan recording of Liaquat Ali Khan’s opening words — Baradran-e-Millat — and then two shots ring out in close succession. Chaos ensues.
 
 

I keep thinking of how a murderer brought his 11-year-old son to such an occasion. The only logical explanation is that he must have been sure of an escape. There are other thoughts, too: were the two shots fired from the same gun? Not so close together. Not likely.
Did my grandfather know he was going to his death? He had been warned of a conspiracy attempt against his life. Why choose to go to Rawalpindi, the hotbed of an earlier conspiracy? Why not just stay safe in Karachi? Who can say — hindsight after all is 20/20. But in my heart, I know. He was unafraid because he truly believed in unity, faith and discipline.</p><small>2025-10-16 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628829-at-least-15-killed-as-truck-plunges-into-ravine-in-swat' target='_blank'><strong>At least 15 killed as truck plunges into ravine in Swat</strong></a><br><p>

The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision, saying the Trump administration’s Venezuela strategy aims to remove Maduro from power.
The administration has offered $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges.
The new authority would allow the CIA to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean, the Times reported.
Asked why he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela, Trump told reporters his reasons were migration of Venezuelans to the United States and drug trafficking.
 






“I authorised for two reasons really,” Trump said.
“Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America…they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.
“And the other thing are drugs,” Trump said.
Trump has not provided evidence for his claim that Venezuela is sending former prisoners to the US.
He added that the US has made progress intercepting drug shipments at sea, and that additional efforts are now focused on overland routes.
“We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” Trump said.
 
 

Reuters could not independently determine what specific actions Trump has authorised and the White House declined to elaborate on the president’s comments.
Historically, the agency’s involvement in such operations has varied widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint.
The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War, and helped topple South America’s cocaine trafficking empires at the end of the 20th century.
Reuters has reported that the CIA has been running covert operations in Mexico for years to track down the country’s most-wanted drug traffickers.
Venezuela’s government said Trump’s remarks constituted a violation of international law and said US actions were aimed at legitimising a “regime change” operation with the goal of seizing the country’s oil resources.
“Our Permanent Mission to the UN will raise this complaint with the Security Council and the secretary general tomorrow, demanding accountability from the United States government,” Venezuela said in a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on his Telegram account.
‘Venezuela feeling heat’
Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of being a hub for trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl, but US records have shown that Mexico is the main source of fentanyl.
Trump was asked by a reporter why he did not have the Coast Guard stop suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been US practice for decades.
Trump called such efforts “politically correct” and said they had not worked.
 
 

Trump declined to answer when asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, saying: “I think Venezuela is feeling heat.”
Trump has ordered a large US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, and the troops have conducted at least five strikes on vessels the Trump administration has described as involved in drug trafficking, without providing evidence.
The campaign is the most recent example of Trump’s efforts to use US military power in new, and often legally contentious, ways, from deploying active-duty US troops in Los Angeles to carrying out counterterrorism strikes against drug trafficking suspects.
The Pentagon recently disclosed to Congress that Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels.
‘Venezuela also released prisoners into US’
Trump also accused Venezuela of releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, although he did not specify which border they were crossing.
Neither Maduro’s Information Ministry nor press representatives for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s remarks.
The Trump administration has provided scant information about the strikes, frustrating members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans.
On Wednesday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration moved the US closer to outright conflict.
“The American people deserve to know if the Administration is leading the US into another conflict, putting service members at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation,” she said in a statement.</p><small>2025-10-16 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f04d921a50b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949239/withering-geoeconomics' target='_blank'><strong>Withering geoeconomics</strong></a><br><p>IT was almost exactly three years ago that a paper was published by Moeed Yusuf and his co-author Rabia Akhtar arguing in favour of a pivot away from geopolitics towards geoeconomics as Pakistan’s primary external orientation. That paper had built upon the National Security Policy (NSP) of 2021 which had expanded the meaning of the word ‘security’ to include human dignity and prosperity as well. Lasting security, the NSP had argued, cannot be built with guns alone, but must also secure people’s rights to live in dignity and pursue their own prosperity.
Recent developments provide a good opportunity to revisit the arguments made in that paper. Subsequent developments have vindicated substantial portions of what the writers were saying but at the same time, things seem to have moved in the opposite direction to the one they urged policymakers to take.
 
 

The paper argued that a sound economic footing built on domestic reform is the key to securing Pakistan’s future. It argued that for a pivot to geoeconomics that was “a significant departure in how Pakistan perceives its own utility for the world”. They observed that Pakistan had traditionally seen itself as a “net security provider to the West, a strategic neighbour for China, and a partner to key Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia as a means of soliciting foreign economic support”. But this model was “structurally flawed”, they argued. And rightly so.
Sadly the advice seems to have generated little more than chatter and ample nodding of heads, with little to no impact on policy. Some of this is due to the powerful hold that geopolitics has on the minds of the establishment, and in equal measure, it is owed to the fact that the world evolved in ways different from what the authors foresaw.

All signs are now pointing in the direction of yet another incoming geopolitical rent.

The authors were right in seeing neoliberalism coming under increasing strain and countries around the world retreating into “economic nationalism”. They were right when they said this tendency would drive a greater role for ‘geoeconomics’ in the future, as more and more countries subordinated their economic policy to the requirements of a changing global order. They were right in pointing out that Pakistan would be at a disadvantage in this world due to its economic weakness, and must deploy a form of geoeconomics that is a “win-win” for its partners rather than a zero-sum game.
But this was the easy part. They were writing after the tariff wars of the first Trump presidency after all, and the dying throes of the liberal world order were all around us. Much of the hysteria around China’s Belt and Road Initiative had peaked, but was still around, and it was possible to see how the world was going to be carved up into competing economic blocs. The conventional wisdom at that time (to which I also subscribed in those days) was that a day was coming when Pakistan would be forced to choose between America and China, that the days of foreign bailouts were ending, Pakistan’s addiction to geopolitical rents would have to be broken.
In pointing the way forward, the authors laid the emphasis on “connectivity”, particularly in energy, as well as “development partnerships” that sought investments rather than aid. And here things began to fall apart.
A few things have happened since then to render outdated this vision of ‘connectivity’. First is the depth of the transformation sweeping the world of energy, as the solar-plus-battery revolution renders the world of gas pipelines, cross-border power transmission lines, foreign investment in refineries and giant power plants obsolete. Connectivity for the authors hinged on energy above all else, but with the energy sector itself in such profound flux, the vision was stillborn.
Second, the connectivity rested on good relations with Afghanistan, normalisation of ties with India, and a lifting of Iran’s sanctions. Each of these now seems like a remote possibility, so even if there was to be a cross-border demand for energy transmission — whether via the Iran gas pipeline or the CASA electricity transmission line — the regional situation seems to be closing these possibilities off more than opening them up.
Development partnerships resting on investments have taken a mortal hit from the most recent episode of near bankruptcy that Pakistan is still trying to emerge from. The message from the past few years that has gone to all foreign investors around the world is that Pakistan is not able to afford any investment because the economy here tends to run out of foreign exchange. The only condition under which investors might come into Pakistan now would be if they were riding the coat-tails of geopolitics.
Most importantly, all signs are now pointing in the direction of yet another incoming geopolitical rent. The specifics are unknown, but Pakistan’s rulers seem to be busy securing for themselves one more round of security-related inflows of exactly the sort that the authors of that paper said Pakistan needs to depart from.
 
 

The stars are aligning for Pakistan in almost startling ways, even if the ground beneath our feet feels a bit shaky. In other places, Moeed Yusuf had warned that Pakistan sits nestled between two regions that have a rising arc of conflict — East Asia and the Middle East — and that these conflicts will find their way to Pakistan. But it turns out Pakistan is instead sitting in the sweet spot, where the conflicts of these regions won’t bother us, but our utility to the big powers in each of these regions will increase.
Today all three — the US, China and Saudi Arabia — are smiling on Pakistan. Yet one more round of geopolitical rents seems to be gathering on the horizon (though it is still not clinched). And old ways of thinking consider themselves vindicated while those of us who have always argued for the merits of learning to stand on our own feet, must perhaps wait another decade for our moment.

This figure undercounts women’s work, particularly the work they do in the informal sector or from home — areas where the majority of working women in Pakistan remain concentrated. But working from home does not carry the same empowering potential that working outside the home does. Similarly, the informal sector typically houses precarious, even hazardous work. So, why don’t more women switch to less vulnerable occupations that also carry a greater potential to raise their status? What are the factors that influence whether or not to participate in the labour market, where to work and how many hours to spend at work?
Financial need remains the primary reason why most of us work. The pressure to provide in economic terms is much higher for men than for women, particularly in societies such as ours that have a strong male breadwinner bias. This means that for many, and more so for men rather than women, the option to not work, simply does not exist.
Yet, working and earning an income is aspirational too. It is the means through which we raise our standard of living and look to achieving loftier goals, especially for our children. Certainly, access to and control over monetary resources has been linked with overall well-being, especially for marginalised groups. Talk to working women, and they will inevitably highlight the fact that having their own stream of income reduces their dependency on others while raising their status within the household. Here, it is the nature of the work that they do that really matters.
 
 

Indeed, not all work is equal. Work outside the home, and that which brings in a steady stream of income, is generally considered more empowering than precarious work. Similarly, jobs that have benefits associated with them, such as pensions, health benefits and paid leave and that are regularised, such as those found in the formal sector, are considered to make the biggest difference on decision-making power. However, even within the formal sector, men and women do not always find themselves vying for the same set of jobs.
When it comes to the type of work that a person does, there are several interconnected factors at play. Greater financial pressures see men being pushed towards occupations where there are larger chances of quick advancement and high pay. For women, the decision of whether and where to work, and which sector to occupy, must balance financial independence with other factors. Particularly when reproductive work falls in women’s spheres, time that must be spent to fulfil domestic responsibilities becomes a primary factor driving the decisions surrounding work.

Men and women do not always find themselves vying for the same set of jobs.

Indeed, social expectations around reproductive roles, and the subsequent higher domestic burdens that women face, often translate into more frequent career breaks, if not an exit from or a failure to enter the labour market altogether. This means that women often pick sectors and roles that allow for greater flexibility and do not penalise discontinuity in career timelines. Yet, ease of breaks comes at other costs. Usually for those with low educational achievement, this means informal sector employment or home-based work. Amongst those who are in the formal sector, jobs that see a greater ease of exit and entry often mean lower wages or sacrificing how far up the occupational ladder women are able to climb.
On the flip side, men typically face strict expectations around their productive roles. Taking breaks in their career, not financially providing for their families, or allowing standards of living to slide, are just not feasible options for them.
Hence, one of the biggest factors underpinning the decisions surrounding work is social norms. Not only do these norms determine the gendering of productive versus reproductive spheres, they also result in pressure to perform certain types of jobs. The subsequent siloing of men and women across sectors is further cemented through a stigmatisation of individuals who go against the established grain. We see this most frequently as an acceptance of women going into sectors that are extensions of their caregiving roles, such as teaching and nursing, and hostility towards women who enter male-dominated spaces. The same holds for men as well — take a survey of early years and primary schools, and while there will be men in administrative roles, there will be very few, if any, in teaching roles.
So, how do we break the norms around work? Ironically, through the labour market. There is a documented lagged effect between women entering the labour market and a softening of gender norms. Hence, as more women take up jobs and participate more actively in the public arena, stereotypes around men as primary or even sole earners within the household, and women as the main caregivers, are shown to change in the medium to long term, ultimately leading to an easing of gender segmentation across and within sectors.
 
 

This, of course, begs the question: how do we raise women’s entry into the labour market? There has been much experimentation with different types of interventions such as introducing role models or reducing care burdens through daycares.
However, it is financial motivations that tend to be most effective. Whether the push comes through macro-fiscal crises or cash transfers conditional on employment and microenterprise support, such as that done in Latin America, greater women’s labour force participation leads to norm shifts. And this is precisely what is needed to change the decisions around work for the better.

“Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian registered aircraft,” the NOTAM said.
Neither aircraft owned or leased by Indian airlines nor Indian military flights are allowed to use Pakistan’s airspace, the authorities said. The ban on the use of airspace will be in effect from Oct 15 to Nov 24.
 
 

The restriction was imposed due to ongoing tensions between the two nations. Pakistan initially shut its airspace on India in April this year and it has maintained the closure ever since.
Earlier on Tuesday, amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afgha­nistan, Pakistani authorities issued a Notam to restrict multiple air routes over its territory, for “operational reasons.”
Several routes were limited on Oct 15 and 16 between 7:30pm and 9:30pm each day. However, the restriction notice was withdrawn by Wednesday afternoon.

The move aims to protect consumers from serious health risks and ensure fair competition in the cosmetics market.  
The CCP’s Office of Fair Trade and Market Intel­li­gence Unit found that several popular whitening pro­ducts available in sto­res and online contain da­­ng­erously high levels of mercury. Many of these products falsely claim to be safe and effective while concealing mercury content from their ingredient lists.
Mercury is a toxic substance that can cause kidney damage, neurological disorders, and skin disea­ses. Its use in cosmetics is banned in most countries.
Despite this, many whitening creams in Pakistan continue to use mercury under misleading labels such as “fairness, glow, and lightening”.  
Under Section 10 of the Competition Act 2010, fal­se or deceptive marketing is prohibited and can res­u­­lt in penalties of up to Rs75 million or 10 per cent of a company’s annual turnover.
The commission has initiated action against all companies responsible for producing or promoting these harmful products. It warned that such practices not only endanger public health but also distort fair market competition.  
Consumers have been advised to stop using any whitening creams suspec­ted of containing high levels of mercury. 
The CCP also urged citizens to rep­ort deceptive advertising or unsafe cosmetic pro­du­cts through its Online Co­­mplaint Portal available on the commission’s website.

According to well-placed sources in the IHC, the judge has obtained a five-year visa on his official passport following the cancellation of his Green Card.
 
 

The decision came in the wake of recently introduced amendments to the Presidential Order and a General Standing Order which make it mandatory for judges to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from chief justices of their respective courts before leaving the country, even during holidays or vacations.
The new standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued under the policy state that the entire time of a judge, including leave, vacations and holidays, is at the disposal of the state. The chief justice has been empowered to regulate such leave and may cancel it even after a judge has departed abroad. Judges are also required to provide their contact details and addresses during any period of leave.

New rules require judges to get NOC from CJs before leaving country even during holidays

Sources said that these regulations have created complications for judges holding foreign permanent residencies, particularly US green cards.
Under American immigration laws, green-card holders must demonstrate intent to permanently reside in the United States, and prolonged absences — especially those exceeding six months — can lead to inquiries and potential revocation of residency rights.
In cases where a green card holder remains abroad for more than a year, they may lose their status unless a special Returning Resident Visa is obtained.
Judicial insiders told Dawn that the new policy effectively made it difficult for judges to retain foreign residencies while fulfilling their constitutional and administrative obligations in Pakistan. They said that the judge’s decision to rescind his green card was made to avoid any conflict with the newly imposed travel restrictions and to ensure full compliance with the court’s administrative framework.
The development has also dispelled speculation that some judges were considering resigning amid reports of internal differences and administrative grouping within the Islamabad High Court.
Instead, the move is being interpreted as an effort to align with the institutional policy and maintain transparency regarding foreign travel.
Earlier, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had raised objections to the NOC requirement in a letter addressed to the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, terming it “a blatant impingement of the Fundamental Right of movement of a judge” and “tantamount to a de facto placement of judges on the Exit Control List”.
His letter argued that such adm­inistrative controls undermined the independence of the judiciary.
The IHC administration, however, maintains that the policy aims to bring uniformity, discipline and transparency in judicial conduct, in line with constitutional principles and public service standards.

The action was undertaken in Mohmand district, officials said, thwarting an attempt by dozens of militants to enter Pakistan, PTV News reported.
 






The operation was carried out on the basis of credible intelligence rep­orts, indicating that a large group of militants was mobilising near the mountainous Khor area of Baha­dar Kalay, officials said.
“Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and launched an intensive operation,” sources said.
State media claimed that at least 30 terrorists had been eliminated, but local sources said the number may be higher.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press, but PTV News claimed the incident demonstrated how the Afghan government was now relying on militant groups to try and exact revenge after their attempts to attack Pakistani territory were effectively foiled.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time and would last for 48 hours.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
The announcement from Islamabad came before the Taliban’s version appeared on social media. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a post on X that “at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side”, the ceasefire would begin after 5:30pm Kabul time and remain in force “unless there is a violation”.
The statements differed on key points, with each side claiming the ceasefire was requested by the other. Pakistan specified a 48-hour duration, while the Taliban described an open-ended truce. Only Pakistan mentioned a follow-up dialogue process.
A senior Pakistani military official, speaking on background, said the Taliban requested the ceasefire after facing what he described as a “powerful response” from Pakistani forces.
Although neither side disclosed whe­ther external mediation played a role, diplomatic sources suggested Qatar helped facilitate the understanding.
 
 

Soon after the announcement, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. Mr Dar thanked Qatar for its “consistent support and positive role”, the statement added.
 






This was the second ceasefire between the two neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. Diplomatic insiders said that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
‘Ceasefire may not hold’
The ceasefire, while a pause in hostilities, highlights the diminishing leverage Pakistan wields over Kabul despite its historical role as the Taliban’s principal external supporter.
Observers warn that the ceasefire may prove temporary without a framework for structured dialogue or a third-party monitoring mechanism in place.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also expressed a lack of confidence in the ceasefire, stressing that the Afghan Taliban had become a “proxy of Delhi”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News on Wednesday night, the defence minister said that the Afghan Taliban are “fighting a proxy war” on behalf of India and stated that they have become a “stooge” for New Delhi.
 
 

“I have my doubts that the ceasefire will hold, because the [Afghan] Taliban are being sponsored by Delhi,” he added. “Right now, Kabul is fighting a proxy war for Delhi.”
Mr Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness and capability to defend itself in the face of further aggression from Kabul.
“We have the capability and we will attack them, God willing, if they escalate or widen the radius of this war,” he said. “There have been deep strikes in Afghanistan and a ceasefire was agreed on after the intervention of friendly countries, but it is fragile. I don’t believe this will last long.”
However, Mr Asif added that in this situation, Pakistan will respond positively to any constructive dialogue but will not tolerate ceasefire violations or attacks on its territory.
“If they bombard our border areas or attack our posts, then we have to respond in kind,” he said. “We do not want to fight, but if we are attacked, we have the right to respond.”
To a question about whether the mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia could come into play here, the minister said friendly countries will “effectively intervene” but noted that it is speculation at present.
Latest escalation
The latest escalation began late on Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday, when Taliban fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on Pakistani border positions in the Chaman sector of Balochistan.
According to officials, the fighting erupted around 2am after Taliban forces opened heavy fire on a Pakistani post in the Sui Karez area of the Kozak Pass using mortars and other heavy weapons.
Pakistani troops stationed in the area retaliated immediately, and intense exc­hanges continued for several hours. The clashes expanded when Taliban forces opened fire across multiple points along the border, including the border town of Chaman, damaging the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Friendship Gate on their side.
Officials said Taliban fighters also targeted nearby villages, injuring many civilians, including women and children.
“At least five civilians were brought to the district hospital with bullet and splinter injuries,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, medical superintendent of the Chaman government hospital.
Authorities declared an emergency in all Chaman hospitals and closed schools, while the anti-polio campaign in the area was suspended as residents began fleeing to safer areas.
“The attack started in the early hours and heavy fighting continued until around 8am,” said Habib Ullah Bangulzai, deputy commissioner of Chaman. He confirmed that additional troops had been deployed to the sector to reinforce the defences.
Pakistan’s military said its troops repulsed the Taliban attacks and launched retaliatory strikes targeting militant camps and installations in Kandahar and Spin Boldak, from where the attacks had been mounted.
“Pakistani jets targeted these important camps being used by Fitna al-Khawarij,” an official said, using a term referring to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghanistan-based terrorist group Islam­a­b­ad blames for recent cross-border attacks.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) later said that at least 20 Taliban fighters were killed and several of their installations destroyed.
Sources in Kandahar said the Taliban confirmed eight deaths in Spin Boldak, including a couple in Vesh Mandi, the first Afghan town across the border. A large number of Taliban fighters were reported wounded in Pakistani strikes.
By morning, heavy exchanges of fire were also reported from multiple points along the Kurram border region, with ISPR saying 25 to 30 Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij militants were killed in the Pakistani response that destroyed several posts and tanks.
Kabul explosions
Shortly before the ceasefire announcement, two explosions rocked Kabul’s Taimani neighbourhood around 4pm local time. The Taliban said the blasts were caused by an oil tanker fire, but residents reported two separate explosions roughly 20 minutes apart. Videos circulating on social media showed a multi-story building engulfed in flames.
Kabul Surgical Centre said it had received 40 casualties, including five fatalities.
 
 

While Pakistan’s military did not officially claim responsibility, state-run PTV reported that “precision strikes” had targeted the leadership of Fitna al-Khawarij.
Tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban regime have soared since Oct 9, when Kabul accused Islamabad of conducting airstrikes inside Afghanistan — an allegation Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied.
The Taliban launched coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11, in which 23 soldiers were martyred. Pakistan claimed its retaliatory operations killed about 200 Taliban fighters.
As both sides enter the temporary tru­ce, questions remain over the next steps. A Pakistani diplomat, speaking anonymously, said the focus will now be on “disengagement details and getting assurances about dismantling cross-border terrorist sanctuaries — the central issue behind this unprecedented escalation”.
The crisis underscores a sharp deterioration in Pakistan-Taliban relations that once appeared anchored in mutual dependence. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
For Pakistan’s military, the recent border clashes are not merely a border management issue but a reflection of Afgh­anistan’s unwillingness to curb cross-border militancy. For the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes are seen as violations of sovereignty, reinforcing its domestic narrative of resistance to external interference.

Ashley Tellis, 64, who has worked in or advised the US government for more than two decades, was found to have kept more than 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, a criminal affidavit said on Tuesday. 
Late in the evening of Sept 25, Tellis entered the State Dept, where he served as an unpaid adviser, and appeared to print from a secret document on US Air Force techniques, the affidavit added. 
It said Tellis met multiple times with Chinese officials at a restaurant in Fairfax, Virginia. 
At one dinner, Tellis entered with a manila envelope but did not appear to leave with it, and on two occasions the Chinese officials presented him a gift bag, the affidavit said. 
Tellis faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on the charges of unlawfully holding documents, the Justice Department said. 
Lawyers for Tellis did not immediately respond to a request for comment “The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for Virginia’s eastern district who has become known for pursuing charges against critics of President Donald Trump. 
The State Department confirmed that Tellis was arrested Saturday but declined further comment due to the ongoing investigation. 
Tellis, a naturalised US citizen originally from India, is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and served in senior positions under former president George W. Bush.

According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs263.02 per litre from Rs268.68 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has dropped to Rs275.41 per litre from Rs276.81 per litre.
Meanwhile, superior kerosene oil (SKO) and light diesel oil (LDO) also experienced rate cuts, with SKO dropping in price from Rs184.97 per litre to Rs181.71 — a drop of Rs3.26. LDO price dropped by Rs2.74 from Rs165.50 per litre to Rs162.76.
The notification added that the new rates were decided on the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
 






Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs79.50 per liter on diesel and Rs80.52 per liter on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per liter climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per liter custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per liter distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p><small>2025-10-15 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628745-imran-khan-seeks-parole-to-help-resolve-afghanistan-problem' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan seeks parole to mediate Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions: sister</strong></a><br><p>

Greta was one of 450 people aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla, a humanitarian aid mission involving over 40 vessels which aimed to deliver food, water and medicine to the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s two-year onslaught on the besieged enclave.
The boats were intercepted by the Israeli navy on October 1, with Greta and all other activists being arrested and kept in Israeli custody. She was released and deported to Greece on October 6.
In her interview, Greta recounted her treatment in Israeli custody, which ranged from humiliation, threats of violence and physical beatings.
“She doesn’t want headlines about herself and the torture she says she was subjected to,” Aftonbladet reported.
“That was one of the first things she said on the evening she returned home, at a press conference in Sergels Torg together with several of the other Swedes who participated in the large Global Sumud Flotilla that attempted to bring emergency aid to Gaza.”
Quoting Greta, the report read, “This is not about me or the others from the flotilla. There are thousands of Palestinians, hundreds of whom are children, who are being held without trial right now, and many of them are most likely being tortured.”
“This shows that if Israel, with the whole world watching, can treat a well-known, white person with a Swedish passport this way, just imagine what they do to Palestinians behind closed doors.”
Greta noted that what the flotilla activists went through is “only a small, small part of what Palestinians have experienced” and described bullet holes with bloodstains and messages carved into the cell walls by Palestinian prisoners detained there previously.
The activist recounted the night the flotilla was boarded, mentioning chemical agents employed by Israel and saying “that she will never again be able to look at a starry sky without thinking about drones”.
“It was extremely hot down there. We just sat there. Those who weren’t guarding us walked around the boat, tearing things apart and throwing everything around,” she described.
“After about 20 hours, they arrived in Ashdod, Israel’s largest industrial port, 40 kilometres south of Tel Aviv. A soldier pointed at Greta Thunberg and said, ‘You first, come on!’” the publication wrote.

Greta added that she was not allowed to wear her t-shirt with “Free Palestine” on it and was ordered to change. She put on an orange one with the text “Decolonize” instead.
“And then I put on my frog hat. When I’m about to get off the boat, there are a bunch of police officers waiting for me,” Greta recalled. “They grab me, pull me to the ground, and throw an Israeli flag over me.”
Aftonbladet reported that Greta was dragged to a paved area fenced in with iron fences in a “protracted scene that lasts for over six hours”, according to Greta and several participants in the flotilla.
“It was kind of dystopian,” Greta said. “I saw maybe 50 people sitting in a row on their knees with handcuffs and their foreheads against the ground.
“They dragged me to the opposite side from where the others were sitting, and I had the flag around me the whole time. They hit and kicked me. Then they ripped off my frog hat, threw it on the ground, stomped and kicked it, and kind of threw a tantrum,” she added.
“They moved me very brutally to a corner that I was turned towards. ‘A special place for a special lady’, they said,” Greta explained. “And then they had learned lilla hora (little whore) and ‘Hora Greta’ (whore Greta) in Swedish, which they repeated all the time.”
Greta added that while the Israeli flag was draped around her, guards would attack her if she touched the flag, even if it flapped towards her. She then described being bound “very tightly” with zip ties.
“They took my bag and threw away everything they interpreted as being related to Palestine,” she added. “They took every item and stared into my eyes while slowly cutting them up with a knife, while ten people took selfies.”
The activist also described the moment far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir came to the facility and verbally abused the detainees.
“He shouted, ’You are terrorists. You want to kill Jewish babies.’ Those who shouted back were taken aside and beaten. They were thrown to the ground and beaten,” Greta recalled. “But I could only see it out of the corner of my eye, because every time I lifted my head from the ground, I was kicked by the guard standing next to me.”
She then described a “moving scene” to Aftonbladet: “I needed to go to the bathroom and asked to do so. Then I had to be led through where people were sitting and they saw me. A female member of the Swedish delegation said, ‘We are with you, Greta.’
“Then she was taken aside and assaulted. When I continue through the rows of people sitting there, they say ‘Slay!’” she added, referring to a slang term meaning to do something well.
“They say ‘Slay’ because they know it’s my word. And those who say slay get beaten by the guards. I continue forward and then someone shouts ‘Slaaaay’. And then more and more people join in and shout ‘Slay’, and when everyone is shouting it, they can’t assault everyone,” Greta said.
Greta then described being taken into a building to be searched and undressed, stating that the guards had “no empathy or humanity”.
“There’s a lot I don’t remember. So much is happening at once. You’re in shock. You’re in pain, but you go into a state of trying to stay calm,” she said.
She described being forced into a cleaning closet, where Ben-Gvir hurled abuse at her while the exchange was filmed.
“Then Ben-Gvir and his media team come in and stand there filming, and he says, ’I will personally make sure that you are treated like a terrorist and that you rot in prison. You are Hamas. You are a terrorist. You want to kill Jewish babies’,” Greta described.
“While he is shouting, I sit as calmly as I can and quote UN conventions and say that Israel is not immune and must respect international law. I thought this was being recorded and would be spread to the public, but I still haven’t seen it spread.”
Greta then said she refused to sign papers stating, among other things, that she had entered Israel illegally, Aftonbladet reported, adding that she was then put in a freezing cold prison van, before being transported to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert.
“It was mockery, rough handling, and everything was filmed,” she said. “Everything they do is extremely violent. People’s medications were thrown into the trash can in front of their eyes. Heart medication, cancer medication, insulin.”
She also described a large picture covering one wall, showing a bombed-out Gaza and people fleeing, with text in Arabic reading, “The new Gaza” next to a large Israeli flag, Aftonbladet reported.
“In prison, she is held in different cells. Sometimes a cell of around 15 square meters with 13 other prisoners,” the report read. “There are many days—four? Time blurs together; there were no clocks. They receive hardly any food and no clean water during their entire captivity, but are forced to drink from the tap in the toilet sink, where something brown flows. Several became ill.”

Greta told the outlet that she “couldn’t afford to cry” because of dehydration and said that she was locked in an isolated cell filled with insects.
“It was so hot, like 40 degrees. We begged the whole time: Can we have water? Can we have water? In the end, we screamed. The guards walked in front of the bars the whole time, laughing and holding up their water bottles. They threw the bottles with water in them into the trash cans in front of us,” she recounted.
Aftonbladet reported that around 60 people were put in a small cage outdoors, citing several participants of the flotilla, adding that most of them did not have room to sit down.
“When people fainted, we banged on the cages and asked for a doctor. Then the guards came and said, ‘We’re going to gas you’,” Greta outlined. “It was standard for them to say that. They held up a gas cylinder and threatened to press it against us.
“During the nights, guards regularly came by and shook the bars, shining flashlights, and several times a night they came in and forced everyone to stand up,” she added.
The activist told the Swedish outlet that Stockholm did not do anything to ensure better conditions for Swedish prisoners and that there was no access to legal representation except for five minutes with a lawyer at a port.
“We were together and told them about the treatment we received. About the lack of food, water, about the abuse. The torture. We showed them the physical injuries we had — bruises and scratches,” she said.
“We gave them all our contact details — I gave them my father’s number and the number of our contact in the organisation. We were clear: everything we say now must be released to the media.”
Greta told Aftonbladet that three people from the Swedish embassy made contact with her and her fellow Swedes, but only to tell them that they had consular access.
“We said over and over again: we need water. And they saw that the guards had water bottles,” she recounted. The embassy staff said: ’We’ll make a note of that.’ One of us, Vincent, said: ’Next time we meet you, you must bring water.’“
When the embassy staff returned two days later, Greta said they did not bring any water, “except for a small bottle of their own that was half empty”.
“Vincent, who was in the worst shape, got to drink it,” she told Aftonbladet. “We kept asking the guards, ‘Can we have some water?’ but they just walked around with their water bottles and didn’t answer.”
Aftonbladet reported: “Several participants reported that a female activist became enraged and kicked the trash can where the guards had thrown their water bottles. Bottles spilled onto the floor, and Greta and the others threw themselves on the floor and hurried to open the bottles and drink the water left behind by the guards.”
Greta added that the embassy staff saw this but left the prison anyway.

The meeting comes in the wake of escalating border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with security forces repelling an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border this morning and killing 15 to 20 fighters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
Today’s clash, the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, follows the incident in Kurram on Tuesday night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to a statement from the President’s Secretariat, Field Marshal Munir briefed the president on Pakistan’s overall internal and external security landscape.
“He (army chief) also apprised the president of the recent security situation arising from the aggressive and provocative actions of the Afghan Taliban regime, as well as the measured and befitting response by the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” the statement read.
It added that the president reaffirmed that Pakistan will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs and expressed full confidence in the “strength, valour, capacity, and preparedness of Pakistan’s Armed Forces”.
President Zardari “lauded their (armed forces) vigilance and professionalism in defending the nation’s frontiers and in swiftly repelling cross-border attacks along the Afghan border”, the statement concluded.
 






President Zardari later met a delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and reviewed matters of national significance, including the prevailing political and security situation, and recent regional as well as international developments affecting Pakistan’s strategic and economic interests.
PM Shehbaz apprised the president of his recent visits to Egypt and Malaysia, including his engagements with international leaders and efforts for peace in Gaza.
“President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif also held a one-on-one discussion, during which they exchanged views on key national priorities and the overall direction of government policies. Both leaders agreed to continue political consultations on matters of national importance,” a statement from the PPP said.
 






According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the weekend skirmishes which began with the Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border.
The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/152133248327e5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949123/imran-khan-has-offered-to-resolve-afghanistan-problem-if-freed-on-parole-ptis-barrister-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan has offered to ‘resolve Afghanistan problem’ if freed on parole: PTI’s Barrister Gohar</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Wednesday that former prime minister Imran Khan has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
 
 

Meanwhile, lingering tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over cross-border terrorism broke out into outright fighting and skirmishes over the weekend that left several dead and injured on both sides. A temporary ceasefire was announced today after three days of fighting.
Addressing a press conference outside Adiala Jail after a meeting with Imran, Barrister Gohar said: “Today, Imran has sent this message: ‘I offer you people that release me on parole and I will solve the Afghanistan problem for you.’”
The same was mentioned a little earlier by Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who said the PTI founder was pained by the repatriation of Afghan refugees in haste after Pakistan hosted them for decades.
As per Noreen, Imran said it was the job of politicians to achieve peace and had offered to play his part in the endeavour if he was released on parole.
 






“They should think because the conditions of Pakistan have become such that three million people have left the country, multi-national companies are leaving the country, and there is no foreign investment in Pakistan. He [Imran] says there is a need for peace and that only comes with political stability,” she said.
However, expressing doubt, Imran’s sister said her brother would never be taken up on his offer.
A message posted on Imran’s X account, which is not controlled by him, asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, the federal government, or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” the message had said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.</p><small>2025-10-15 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628750-pakistan-passport-remains-fourth-weakest-in-global-index-for-fifth-year' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan passport remains fourth weakest in global index for fifth year</strong></a><br><p>

A notification issued by the revenue board read that the deadline was being extended following requests from trade bodies and tax bar associations, and was being implemented as per Section 214A of the 2001 Income Tax Ordinance.
“The Federal Board of Revenue is pleased to communicate that the date of filing of Income Tax Return for Tax Year 2025, for the persons who were required to file their returns by September 30, 2025 and was extended up to October 15th, 2025 … is further extended to October 31, 2025, in view of the requests from various trade bodies and tax bar associations,” the notification read.
 






This is the second time the FBR has extended the deadline for filing income tax returns despite an earlier stance that it would not do so, signalling that the tax authority yielded to pressure from various quarters and walked back on its firm commitment.
At midnight on September 30, the initial deadline for filing tax returns for tax year 2025, the FBR announced that it was extending the deadline to October 15. The extension was granted in response to requests made by various trade bodies, tax bar associations, and the general public.</p><small>2025-10-15 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628742-watch-aussie-cricketers-troll-india-over-no-handshake-controversy' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Aussie cricketers troll India over no-handshake controversy</strong></a><br><p>
