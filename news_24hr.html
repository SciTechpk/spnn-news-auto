The Golden Visa is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.
This week, several Indian media outlets, including The Press Trust of India and The Hindu, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.
Meanwhile, Times of India reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based Gulf News also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.
“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the WAM report said.
“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”
According to WAM, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.
The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.
The WAM report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”
It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”
The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.</p><small>2025-07-09 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091050333ea7e9c.png?r=105104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922953/frontline-players-ignored-again-as-pakistan-name-squad-for-bd-t20s' target='_blank'><strong>Frontline players ignored again as Pakistan name squad for BD T20s</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan selectors on Tuesday anno­unced a 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match T20 International series against Bangladesh, with five frontline players including former captains Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afr­idi omitted for a second series in a row, while two uncapped pacers were called up.
Vice-captain Shadab Khan and fast bowler Haris Rauf were also ruled out due to fitness issues. Shadab is recovering from shoulder surgery in England, while Haris sustained a hamstring injury during a T20 league match in the United States last week.
Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen were left out again as the selectors continue to experiment with new faces ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup, scheduled for February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka.
While Babar and Rizwan have faced criticism for their strike rates in the format, Shaheen’s recent dip in form has also been a factor despite the pacer topping the bowling charts of the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. Both Rizwan and Babar last featured in the T20I squad during the South Africa tour last year, whereas Shaheen played on the New Zealand tour after that.
 
 

Fast bowlers Ahmed Daniyal, 28, and Salman Mirza, 31, have been rewarded for their strong performances in the PSL and are set to make their T20I debuts.
The squad also sees the return of all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz, who last played a T20I in January 2024, and left-arm spinner Sufyan Muqeem. Middle-order batter Hussain Talat, who was also picked in last month’s home series against Bangladesh, continues to stay in the national squad having played his last T20I in 2021. However, his selection has raised some eyebrows given a modest record of 394 runs and four wickets in 18 T20Is.
The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who continues as captain, while no vice-captain has been named in the absence of Shadab.
In an unusual development, the squad was announced by Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmad Sayed and Media Director Amir Mir — instead of any member of the four-person selection committee.
Although committee member Aaqib Javed was present at the National Cricket Academy adjacent to the Gaddafi Stadium, and both Azhar Ali and Aleem Dar reside in Lahore, none of the selectors attended the press conference.
 


The announcement came abruptly following a previously scheduled presser by the PCB’s domestic cricket department, catching the media off guard. It marked the first time that a national squad was unveiled by PCB’s administrative and media personnel rather than the selectors themselves.
The national team will assemble in Karachi for a training camp starting Wednesday ahead of the Bangladesh tour. The T20I matches are scheduled to be held on July 20, 22 and 24 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.
The squad for the white-ball series against the West Indies, scheduled after the Bangladesh tour, will be announced later.
Squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Sufyan Muqeem

A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Pakistan in May last year.
“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the Foreign Office said in a post on X. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”
 






It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.
 






Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious, and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect.
On Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.
Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.
The two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.
In February, President Erdogan also visited Pakistan, during which both nations pledged to ensure bilateral trade worth $5bn.</p><small>2025-07-09 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09102441549e5c1.jpg?r=102606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922878/punjab-police-officers-asked-to-submit-dual-nationality-certificates-by-monday' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police officers asked to submit dual nationality certificates by Monday</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI:Following the Inspector General of Police Punjab’s orders, police officers and officials holding dual citizenship have been directed to promptly submit their dual nationality certificates.
City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani, in his directives to all SPs, including security, CIA and Investigation, SDPOs, SHOs, Muharrar police lines, security division and in-charges of Dolphin Force, Elite Force and others to submit dual citizenship certificate, either they have been holding or not, without any delay by Monday.
Earlier in May, IGP Dr Usman Anwar had sought the details of the police officials and officres of Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), who had been holdingdualnationality.
 
 

The IGP had also sought the details of how many police officials of inspectors ranks, inspector legal and senior traffic wardens had been holding dual nationality.
In this regard, a performa, seeking the name of region and unit, names of the country holding dual citizenship, date of holding dual citizenship and name of inspector Establishment Branch, Inspector Legal, inspector /telecommunication, fingerprint bureau & Senior Traffic Warden etc holding dual nationality.
The IGP has directed the police across the province, including IGP National Highway & Motorway Police Islamabad, the commandant national police academy Islamabad, additional inspector generals of police South Punjab, Multan, Investigation branch, Special Branch, CTD, PHP, IAB, EPF, Operations, Crime Control Department (CCD) and Training, Punjab to provide the details of their dual citizenship.
All regional police officers (RPOs), DG anti-corruption Punjab, DG FIA Islamabad, COO Safe Cities Authority, the Chief Traffic Officers, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan and Rawalpindi. All principal Police Training Schools in Punjab and Commandant Ring Road Police Lahore had been directed to provide the names of officers with ranks DSP, ASP and above, postings and dual nationality, if yes then also mention the name of the country.
A senior police officer revealed that 30 to 40 percent of officials/officers’ families had been holding dual nationalities of different countries, including Canada, Turkiye, UK and Malta and this trend is more in Punjab police compared to KPK and other provinces.
While citing one example of a police officer who went abroad for study after getting long leave from the police department but when he returned back to Pakistan, he was holding a dual nationality.
Another police officer said that one should be asked whether the police officers/officials themselves have been holding dual nationality and how many families of police officials/officers have been holding dual nationality.
Once the families of police officers/officials get the dual nationality, it becomes much easier for them to get it after retirement or in case of acquitting the job.

The victim, who was  “neither a passenger nor an airport employee”, forced his way onto the runway, where he was  “pursued” in vain by airport security, according to the spokesperson for airport management company SACBO.
According to Italy’s Corriere della Sera daily, the man was a 35-year-old Italian. It said he burst into the airport, then used an emergency exit to rush onto the runway towards an aircraft preparing for take-off.
Earlier in the day, Spanish airline Volotea wrote on social media that its flight from Bergamo to Asturias in Spain was involved in an “incident” at 10:35am.

Addressing a press conference at the residence of former president of Supreme Court Bar Association Abdul Lateef Afeidi (late) at Hayatabad on Tuesday, ANP central president Senator Animal Wali Khan emphasised that the party would vigorously defend both the 18th and 25th Amendments at all costs.
On the occasion, several people, including the family of Abdul Lateef Afridi, headed by Danish Afridi, announced joining the ANP.
The party’s provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and other office-bearers were also present.
Aimal Wali highlighted that the integration of Fata was a historic milestone for ANP, aiming to bring development and modernisation to the region. However, he lamented that the promises made to the people of these areas had not been fulfilled by the government.

Aimal laments promises made to people of ex-Fata remain unfulfilled

He pointed out that the main obstacle to development in the tribal districts was the control over the natural resources in the region.
“The exploitation of these resources without benefiting the local population is keeping them in backwardness,” he said.
Aimal Wali mentioned the irony of Waziristan, where the chilgoza (pine nuts) forests were protected, but the people living there were not safe. He said that this situation underscored the need for prioritising human security over resource protection.
The ANP leader made it clear that the party would strongly resist any possible attempts to roll back the 25th Constitutional Amendment, just as it had defended the 18th Amendment. He reaffirmed his party’s stance, saying that the struggle for protecting the amendment would continue, whether the party ANP was in parliament or not.
Aimal Wali reiterated ANP’s stance against terrorism and extremism. He emphasised that the implementation of the National Action Plan was crucial for establishing peace in the region.
He criticised the Senate elections, suggesting that the outcome was predetermined and that the process was unconstitutional.
Aimal Wali mentioned that ANP was allocated only one reserved seat and expressed willingness to give up even that seat if it could lead to systemic improvements.
He dismissed the news of the President Asif Ali Zardari stepping down and the talk of 27th Amendment as mere attempts to gauge public reaction, calling it a tactic to mislead the public.
He reaffirmed ANP’s commitment to defending constitutional rights, promoting peace, and ensuring development in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The party, he said would remain steadfast in its opposition to any moves that undermine the province’s autonomy and the rights of its people.

• Sets aside notification declaring JUI-F’s Gorpal Singh minority lawmaker
• IHC also issues notice to Election Commission over KP reserved seats
PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday barred two women MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly from taking oath and directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to modify its last year’s notification on the allocation of these seats.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal also set aside the ECP’s notification dated March 26, 2024, which had declared Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) candidate Gorpal Singh as MPA-elect on a seat reserved for non-Muslims in the KP Assembly.
The court directed the ECP to reallocate reserved seats for women and non-Muslims within 10 days in accordance with the law, after hearing all relevant political parties, their representatives and contesting candidates.
Until the ECP issues a new decision, the bench ordered that the oath should not be administered to JUI-F MPAs-elect Naheeda Noor and Arifa Bibi, who were elected on the disputed seats.
The bench issued a short order on a petition filed by the PML-N through its KP President Amir Muqam, who challenged two ECP notifications dated March 4 and March 26, 2024. These notifications declared candidates from various parties as MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.
The PML-N argued that both it and JUI-F had seven MPAs in the KP Assembly, but while PML-N received eight reserved seats for women, JUI-F was allotted 10. On the non-Muslim seats, JUI-F was granted two out of four seats, whereas PML-N was allocated only one.
The petition also challenged the ECP’s cut-off date of Feb 22, 2024, for independent MPAs to join political parties, after which reserved seat allocations were made.
The bench declared that the ECP’s use of the Feb 22 date for allocating reserved seats was illegal and contrary to the mandate of Article 106 of the Constitution, Sections 18 and 104 of the Elections Act 2017, and Rule 92 of the Elections Rules 2017.
The bench pointed out that the electoral college for reserved seats must include all members of political parties, as well as independent candidates who have joined parties, as of the actual date of election or allocation of the reserved seats.
A panel of lawyers, including Aamir Javed, Saqib Raza and Syed Inayat Shah, appeared for the petitioner and stated that the PML-N had initially won five seats in the Feb 8 general elections, and two independents later joined it.
Mr Javed said that the ECP allegedly calculated reserved seat allocations based on only six MPAs rather than seven. He noted that although an independent MPA joined PML-N on Feb 22, the same day he was officially notified as an MPA-elect, the ECP did not include him in the final seat tally.
Initially, the ECP allocated five women’s seats on Feb 22 — two each to PML-N and JUI-F, and one to PPP. On March 4, it issued a second notification for the remaining 21 seats, resulting in JUI-F receiving a total of 10 reserved seats and PML-N eight.
As for the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, one each was initially allocated to JUI-F, PML-N and PPP. The petitioner contended that the fourth seat should have been decided through a draw between JUI-F and PML-N, but the ECP unilaterally awarded it to JUI-F candidate Gorpal Singh.
The ECP was represented by Special Secretary Zafar Iqbal, legal counsel Mohsin Kamran Siddique, Special Secretary (Law) Mohammad Arshad and Deputy Director Saima Tariq Janjua. Advocate Naveed Akhter appeared for JUI-F and argued that his party had not been made a respondent in the petition despite being directly affected.
IHC issues notice to ECP
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday also issued a notice to the ECP on a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), seeking suspension of the ECP’s July 2 notification allocating 21 reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the plea. PTI-P’s legal team, comprising Advocates Sultan Muhammad Khan and Tufail Shahzad, appeared in court alongside the party’s Central Secretary General Malik Habib Noor.
Advocate Khan argued that the ECP’s notification was based on flawed calculations and had deprived PTI-P, founded in 2023 by the former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak, of its lawful share of reserved seats. He maintained that the party should have received additional seats based on its performance in the Feb 8 general elections.
Justice Minhas inquired whether any court had suspended the notification. The lawyer confirmed that no stay had been granted so far. The court declined to suspend the notification immediately but issued a notice to the ECP to submit a response and adjourned the hearing.
PTI-P argued that allowing lawmakers elected through the disputed notification to take oath would cause “irreversible prejudice” and undermine the party’s main petition.
The party contended that the ECP’s March 4, 2024, notification erroneously recorded PTI-P as having secured only one general seat in KP, whereas it had actually won two — PK-73 and PK-103. This misrepresentation allegedly cost the party at least three reserved seats.
The matter was also earlier under review in the PHC, which had granted a stay on the oath-taking of MPAs on reserved seats. However, after a two-member PHC bench raised questions about the petition’s maintainability in light of similar proceedings at the IHC, PTI-P withdrew its petition from the PHC, resulting in the dismissal of the case and recall of the stay order.

The project, approved by the KWSC in Feb 2025, involves laying a 36-km dedicated pipeline to the DHA along with the construction of a pumping station, forebay and a filtration plant.
Clifton and DHA have faced an acute shortage of water for years. The approved pipeline is designed to carry 10 million gallons per day (MGD) to the affected localities.
Although the plan for a dedicated DHA pipeline has been under consideration for several years, the Cantonment Board Clifton previously opposed it due to financial constraints.

CM Murad asks water utility to complete laying of dedicated 36-km long pipeline from Dumlottee within 11 months

A press statement, issued by the CM House on Tuesday, said that the cabinet approved the interest-free loan to address Karachi’s worsening water crisis, particularly in the DHA, where residents currently receive only four to five MGD, far below the growing demand.
The meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, was attended by provincial ministers, advisors, special assistants, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah and senior officers from relevant departments.
The CM directed the water utility to complete the project within 11 months, stressing the urgency of long-term water solutions for the city’s rapidly expanding population. 
To accelerate coal transport from Thar to the port, the cabinet approved Rs45.02bn for a railway project linking Islamkot (Thar Coalfield) to Chorr, as part of a joint venture with the federal government.
The project includes a 105-km rail line, a 9-km dual track from Bin Qasim to Port Qasim and a coal unloading terminal. 
The cabinet approved the allocation of 248 acres for the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway (M-6), valued at Rs667.23m.
Additional reservations were authorised across Jamshoro, Matiari, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur and Naushahro Feroze, subject to departmental NOCs.
The cabinet endorsed the Sindh Agricultural Income Tax Rules, 2025, introducing clear procedures for registration, e-filing and record-keeping by agricultural income earners.
Under the new rules, agricultural owners must register with the Sindh Revenue Board using Form AIT-01 and the Tax Returns (Form AIT-03) must be submitted with evidence of payment.

The Sindh culture department has taken notice of it and asked the owner of the house to stop it. During a visit to the site on July 5 by this scribe, it was revealed that a considerable part of the building inside had been demolished. The debris was found on the site. Its face was, however, partly demolished.
Uzair, who introduced himself as son of the property owner, told Dawn that the building was too old and had developed cracks. “Its pieces were falling again after the recent spell of rain last month, therefore, we started demolishing it,” he said. He confirmed that an application was filed before the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) to declare it as dangerous.
He, however, had no answer when pressed as to how his family started demolishing it on its own when it was not declared dangerous yet. He gave evasive replies. His father was not present as he had proceeded with a tableeghi jamaat for preaching, according to him.
The building on the face of it had some unique construction features. A view that went viral a few days ago showed that labourers were using strong hammers to demolish its structure. According to Uzair’s claim, the building was in use of multiple owners within his family.
A notice was, however, pasted on one end of the building by the Sindh culture department’s Rukunuddin Qureshi, cartographer/focal person for heritage buildings Hyderabad. According to the notice, it was city survey number 2056 Ward-C located in Nain Ka Pir, Khai road.
A July 3 report addressed by Mr Qureshi to the assistant director (heritage) of culture, tourism, antiquities & archives department, said he had visited the site and found that the owner lately started demolition work of this ‘pre-partition building’ bearing CS No. 2056/C.
His report said “The architecture of that ground plus one building has unique construction, thus deserved to be declared as ‘protected’ and its face has partly been demolished. It was built of burnt brick with special size provided by four floral design pillar on each square structure,” said report.
Mr Qureshi met owner Faisal Qureshi to apprise him of the architectural value of the building and asked him to stop work. Answering a query about the SBCA, the owner told Qureshi that he had filed application to the building authority but he had no document to share.
He said the building in question was a pre-partition era structure having unique façade, therefore, the authorities and SBCA should be approached to get demolition work stopped on an urgent basis and they should not issue any demolition order without consultation of the culture department for saving one of the cultural jewels of Hyderabad.
According to a culture official, Naqash Sahito, the building’s survey was done previously and a proposal was submitted to the culture department’s Technical Committee for inclusion/declaration of that property in the heritage list. He said that work remained stopped on the site on Monday. Naqash was not sure about its actual period of construction but hinted that it might have been built in the early 20th century.
A letter was also addressed by the assistant director (heritage) Karachi to the SBCA’s regional director on July 4 to get demolition work on the subject plot halted immediately. If any permission regarding demolition or construction work on it was given, the same be suspended until decided by technical/advisory committee.

KARACHI: With the provincial government setting up a high-powered committee to investigate the recent collapse of a multi-storey building in Lyari that killed 27 people, authorities have ordered occupants of nine “dilapidated” buildings to vacate their homes as an operation begins to demolish one of the “weakened” structures in the same vicinity.
The developments came in the wake of the tragedy, which also left several families displaced and raised alarm over the state of “ageing and illegally constructed buildings” in the city.
Some occupants of such buildings were seen emptying their homes on Tuesday and transporting their belongings to temporary abodes.
A number of residents also staged a protest demonstration, demanding that the government provide alternative housing before demolishing the properties they had purchased with their hard-earned money.
In the early hours of Tuesday, demolition crews began tearing down one of the nine newly identified structures as part of an emergency safety drive.
Officials said the buildings had been found to be structurally “unsound” and posed a severe risk to occupants and nearby residents.
A spokesperson for the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) confirmed that notices had been issued to the occupants, urging them to vacate immediately in order to avoid further tragedies.
Governor visits displaced families
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori on Tuesday visited the site of the collapsed building.
During the visit, he faced a group of emotional residents and activists demanding accountability and immediate relief.
Public outrage over the tragedy continues and has led to street protests in the affected area.
Mr Tessori, accompanied by senior administration officials, met with the affected families and promised swift support.
He announced that each displaced family would be allotted an 80-square-yard residential plot.
“We stand with the victims during this difficult time. We will ensure no family is left without shelter,” he said, adding that interim housing arrangements would be made until permanent plots are allocated.
Speaking to the media, Governor Tessori vowed to personally look into the matter.
“I will be sending all my recommendations regarding this tragedy to the Sindh government through a formal letter. This is no minor matter. There will be no silence, and those responsible will be held to account,” he stated.
He also urged the provincial government to provide six months’ rent and temporary relocation within the same locality for residents evacuated from the dangerously unsafe buildings.
He further assured that the Governor House would remain actively engaged in relief efforts, offering essential support including ration supplies and employment opportunities for the affected families.
As the government continues to identify more dangerous structures, questions remain about the authorities’ capacity to both enforce regulations and ensure humane treatment of residents displaced by such enforcement.
Five-member committee notified
The Sindh government on Tuesday formed a five-member inquiry committee headed by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, comprising Special Secretary Ayesha Hameed, SBCA’s Nadeem Ahmed and Asif Ali Langah and the local government department’s Hammadullah Seehar.
“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident, which occurred on 4 July 2025, and submit its findings within 48 hours. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) also mandate the committee to identify those responsible for negligence and propose recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future,” said a statement detailing the notification.
“Furthermore, the committee is tasked with developing a mechanism for the evacuation of residents from buildings deemed dangerous. It has been authorised to co-opt any relevant officer required during the course of the inquiry.”
The committee held its maiden meeting on Tuesday.

And perhaps the most unfortunate development during this meeting was the fact that the Israeli leader — responsible for the murder of tens of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children — announced that he had nominated Mr Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Sometimes reality is far more grotesque than fiction. And though negotiations for a possible ceasefire continue, no one should doubt Israel’s long-term intentions even if the butchery stops: the Israeli state seeks to ethnically cleanse the occupied territories of their Palestinian inhabitants, and forever obstruct the chances of a viable Palestinian state.
 
 

Those who believe a two-state solution is still possible should listen closely to what Mr Netanyahu said at the White House. “Never again” he declared when discussing a “complete state” for the Palestinians, while adding that “overall security will always remain in our hands”. By security, one assumes the Israeli leader means that Tel Aviv will always retain the ‘right’ to butcher Palestinians into submission should they step out of line. As for Gaza? The Israeli leader repeated the intention to ethnically cleanse the Strip, and ship the Palestinians off to other countries.
His defence minister offered more details, saying that all of Gaza’s Palestinians will be rounded up into a concentration camp in Rafah, and after “deradicalisation”, they will be “encouraged” to leave for other states. Perhaps starvation and mass murder are amongst the methods the Israeli state uses to ‘encourage’ Palestinians to flee. But the brave people of Gaza are not ready to go anywhere; they would rather die on their land than face expulsion and exile.
Ever since the Oct 7, 2023 events, over 57,000 people have been slaughtered by Israel in Gaza. However, the Gaza Mortality Survey, conducted by experts from the UK and other Western states, suggests the actual death toll may be over 83,000.
But to the world these are mere numbers; no one has the moral courage to halt this massacre. What is particularly shocking is how much Zionism in modern Israel resembles Nazism in 20th-century Europe. Both are exclusionary ideologies, with their followers known to perpetrate unimaginable cruelty. The Nazis sent their victims off to the gas chambers; the Israeli state oversees a genocide in Gaza. But while Nazism is today rightly condemned the world over, the modern followers of Zionism get the best seat at the table, and are wined and dined by the world’s most powerful leaders, as the children of Gaza suffer and die in pain.

• Limited funds, land acquisition, geographical and security challenges cited as reasons for delays
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed dissatisfaction over National Highway Authority’s (NHA) ‘poor performance’ and ‘lack of merit and transparency’ in award of mega infrastructure projects.
The Senate standing committee on communications directed the authority to ensure greater transparency, better project management, and enhanced coordination among relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and efficient completion of vital infrastructure projects across the country.
Chaired by Senator Pervaiz Rash­­id, the committee meeting reviewed the status of the ongoing NHA projects under public sector development programme (PSDP) and examine toll tax revenue details.
The senators expressed serious dissatisfaction over the lack of progress despite funds being made available. They also criticised the communications secretary besides the NHA for failing to meet their commitments.
When the NHA chairman reassured the parliamentary body that all pending projects would be initiated without further delay, the committee sought a regular update on progress.
Senators Saifullah Abro and Za­­mir Hussain Ghumro raised strong objections to the award of Tranche-III project to Ningxia Commu­nic­a­tion Construction — a company previously disqualified for failing to co­­­mplete the Lodhran-Multan project.
Senator Abro highlighted a conflict of interests, noting that the arbitrator appointed in a related dispute was allegedly a former legal adviser of the company.
The committee, however, agreed to address the matter separately in next sittings.
Senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir called for timely payments to contractors to avoid delays and asked the government to protect contractors’ rights during project allocation.
Senators Dost Ali Jeesar, Zamir Hussain Ghumro, Palwasha Moham­mad Zai Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Ab­­dul Wasay, Asad Qasim and Jam Saif­­ullah also attended the meeting.
Rajanpur-D.I. Khan carriageway
The senators were briefed on the additional carriageway project along the Rajanpur-D.G. Khan (121km) and D.G. Khan-D.I. Khan (208km) portions of the National Highway (N-55) under the CAREC Corridor Development Investment Programme, Tranche-III. The NHA chairman said the ADB-funded project, whose PC-1 was approved in 2023, had 11 bypasses, but pending land acquisition delayed work. It would take at least three to four months more to begin work on the project, the panel was informed.
The Senate committee chairman noted that delays significantly increased overall costs and said priority should be given to completing the ongoing projects instead of initiating work on other projects.
PSDP
However, NHA officials briefed the committee that uplift projects under the PSDP (2025-26) were categorised as critical national projects, petroleum development levy projects, essential rupee-cover projects, near-completion projects and strategic new projects.
At the briefing, the NHA officials said Rs226.982 billion was allocated for 71 projects against the demand of Rs655.499bn.
They cited limited funds, land acquisition problems and geographical challenges among the causes of delay in the completion of projects. Frequent damages to machinery and infrastructure in Balochistan also came up during the discussion.
Toll tax, revenue
The committee was briefed on toll tax rates and revenue collection for 2023-25. The NHA reported that total 211 toll plazas were operational, 100 on national highways and 111 on motorways. Out of all, 68 toll plazas are auctioned and managed privately, while 16 are directly managed by the NHA. According to a revenue report, the NHA collected Rs32.98bn during the fiscal year 2023-24 and had projected revenue of Rs64.79bn for 2024-25.
Toll rates on the National High­ways are set at Rs30 for cars, Rs50 for wagons, Rs100 for buses, Rs120 for two- and three-axle trucks, and Rs250 for articulated trucks. Slightly higher toll rates apply at some specific locations such as the Kohat tunnel and the Islamabad-Muzaffarabad dual carriageway.
However, committee members expressed concern over the burden of high toll taxes on the general public. They also demanded the restoration of discontinued mobile phone service for toll tax payments to facilitate travellers.

The decision to post Frontier Corps (FC) personnel for security at the canal was taken by the provincial Apex Committee on Tuesday.
The meeting was presided over by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Corps Commander Lt Gen Rahat Nasim Khan.
The meeting was convened to discuss the law and order situation and other issues in the province.
The meeting resolved to intensify the ongoing anti-smuggling drive, with strict action to be taken against transport companies involved in illegal activities and FIRs would be lodged against offending drivers.

Apex committee warns blocking of road or highway won’t be allowed in the name of protest

While reviewing anti-terrorism measures, the meeting directed officials concerned to finalise rules under the Anti-Terrorism Act promptly.
The committee decided that protesters will not be allowed to block roads or highway in any area of Balochistan.
“No road in the province will be allowed to be blocked. The Constitution stands with the person fighting for life in an ambulance,” Mr Bugti said.
Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said action would be taken against those involved in smuggling, illegal remittances, extortion and subversive activities.
The committee also directed the FIA to act against illegal money transfers and step up action against those social media accounts spreading “anti-state propaganda”.
The committee also pledged to eliminate extortion and enhance operations against illegal immigrants.
Police and Levies personnel were ordered to strengthen the counter-terrorism response.
The Home Department briefed members of the committee on the digitalisation of the Fourth Schedule process.
The committee decided the provincial government will expand the Bolan route of the National Highway and construct the Dera Murad Jamali Bypass.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) was ordered to complete the Quetta Western Bypass by December 25.
He warned that anyone acting against the state would face consequences.
If the NHA delays or hinders road projects, the provincial government will assume responsibility for the project’s construction in public interest.
To that end, he said, the government has allocated Rs1.7 billion for the Bolan route expansion.
The meeting also resolved to ban the entry of liquefied petroleum tankers into residential areas.
The committee decided to celebrate Independence Day and ‘Marka-i-Haq’ — the official name for Pakistan’s response to Indian aggression in May — with patriotic spirit.

There may not be any specific plan on the table yet to revert to the old order, but the prime minister’s decision to form a committee headed by the Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan to look into the matter has raised serious concerns.
A recent meeting of the committee members, comprising mostly federal government officials, stressed the need to revive the jirga system in the districts. According to media reports, ways were discussed to promote an effective alternative justice system in the former tribal districts. The jirga system, a traditional form of conflict resolution, was abolished after the merger of the seven tribal agencies in 2018 through the 25th Constitutional Amendment.
One fails to understand the objective behind such a regressive, unconstitutional move that will not only weaken the unity of the federation but also have serious implications for our national security. The KP government has rejected the committee’s formation, referring to it as federal interference in provincial matters, thus intensifying the stand-off between Islamabad and Peshawar.
Fata’s merger with KP in 2018 in the wake of rising militancy was viewed as a significant step towards bringing the lawless semi-autonomous regions into the mainstream and providing better governance and development to its population. But seven years on, the promise has not been fulfilled. The transition has faced numerous challenges mainly because of limited financial resources for the development of infrastructure in the merged districts and improvement in the lives of the people.

There’s something ominous about the centre’s efforts to revive the jirga system in former Fata.

Over the past seven years, the federal government has neither provided the promised development funds of Rs100 billion annually to the merged districts nor its three per cent share in the National Finance Commission award. The situation has worsened with the ongoing confrontation between the federal government and the PTI-led provincial administration. The resurgence of militancy in the region has also caused the complete collapse of governance in the merged districts.
Instead of addressing these challenges, it seems that the federal government is trying to revert to the old colonial structure, which was the main factor contributing to the backwardness of the former federally administered tribal areas called Fata.
The latter was governed by the controversial Frontier Crimes Regulation and political agents. Disputes were settled by local jirgas comprising tribal elders and maliks appointed by the federal government. The courts had no jurisdiction in the area, which was directly controlled by the centre. The provisions of the Constitution and the laws did not apply there.
For decades since independence, because of political and geostrategic reasons, there was no effort to bring the region into the mainstream. Fata’s semi- autonomous status provided the state plausible deniability when the region was turned into a centre for training and then launching militants from within the country and outside into Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet forces.
But this situation also resulted in Fata becoming a hub of militancy that threatened Pakistan’s own security. It also led to the complete collapse of state control over the strategically located region. The vacuum was filled by terrorist groups — such as the TTP — which took control of the area. While successive military operations largely cleared the area of militants, they also caused a huge humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to leave their homes and businesses to escape the fighting.
Most of them might have returned to their devastated land, but many migrated to other areas in search of livelihood. One reason for integrating the tribal areas into the mainstream was to establish the writ of the state there and carry out development works in the conflict-devastated territory. But seven years on, the plight of the people in the districts has not improved. The administrative and justice system remain broken mainly because of lack of financial resources. This has added to the public’s discontent.
Most worrisome is the return of militancy in the merged districts with the weakening of the administration and justice system. The military is in the region fighting the insurgents. But the problem is that there is no realisation in Islamabad and Pindi that kinetic operations alone cannot bring peace and stability to the troubled areas. What is needed is the acceleration of the reform programme rather than reverting to the obsolete jirga system. There is an urgent need to strengthen the civil law-enforcement services and accelerate development work.
There was a broader consensus among the political parties, except for a few, on mainstreaming the former tribal territories. But this rethinking in the ruling party on reform is quite intriguing. Some reports suggest that there is move to bring back former Fata under federal rule thus allowing Islamabad to retake control of the mineral mines there.
In fact, the KP Assembly did not pass the mines and mineral legislation that would have given the federal government some control over the mines. The former tribal areas have huge deposits of rare earth and other minerals which has drawn the interest of the Trump administration.
There certainly is something sinister about the federal government rethinking ex-Fata’s reforms and the revival of the jirga system there. By denying the region its democratic and civil rights, the state is further alienating the tribesmen. It will be disastrous if the security pretext is used.
Some unconfirmed reports suggest that one reason behind the apparent move to backtrack on reforms are the security establishment’s concerns over the rising arc of insurgency in the region. But restoring the old order will only worsen matters. Any such move will strengthen the militants, further threatening our security. The state must respect the sentiments of the people who want to be fully part of the country.

Speaking at the conf­erence on ‘Pakistan’s Final Warning: Climate Calamity or Col­­lective Action’, the PPP senator said that despite unprecedented clim­a­­te shocks, there was a trou­­­bling silence in policy corridors.
“I see no alarm bells ringing anywhere in power corridors. No budgets are being recalibrated for coping better with the crisis,” she noted.
“If there is one priority for collective climate action in Pakistan it has to be water conservation. The water crisis means we have either too much water in the system and rivers at the wrong time, or too little when and where we need it, to sustain food security and livelihoods across the country.
Pakistan, she noted, is deeply underprepared for the scale of climate investment required: “To meet the climate crisis head on, everything will have to be scaled up. Finance is just one part of it. And let’s be clear — it’s not coming in anywhere close to the quantum needed by frontline ecosystems like ours.”
She also reminded the in­­t­ernational community of their responsibilities and str­­essed the importance of public-private partnerships.

Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi has called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
The recommendations were prepared by Justice Munib Akhtar, also an SJC member.
The SC, through an announcement on the completion of the first 100 days of CJP Afridi in office, had explained the SJC had examined 46 complaints against constitutional officeholders and 40 of them have been disposed of. In five complaints, comments have been sought while further information was asked for in another case.
In one of the SJC sittings, it was decided regular sessions would be held every month in order to clear the backlog of outstanding complaints against superior court judges on a fast track.
Also, the SJC in its July 12 meeting is expected to resume consideration of a letter by six judges alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.
The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.
The letter had earlier prompted the then CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had recused himself from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that “inaction by IHC chief justice or judges” should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy [IHC] chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions and would amount to interference in the independence of the high courts,” Justice Afridi had suggested at the time.
The weekend meeting of the council will also be attended by senior puisine judge of the Supreme Court Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
According to an announcement, the SJC is actively considering amendments to its code of conduct and procedure of enquiry.  The SJC had appointed Justice Munib Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.

Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Upon receiving intelligence about a group of Fitna al-Khawarij militants attempting to infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border in Lowi Mamund tehsil’s mountainous areas, security personnel responded swiftly, foiling the attempt and eliminating all eight militants, the sources said.
They said that following the successful action, the security forces have further tightened surveillance and monitoring of the border areas to prevent any future infiltration of Fitna al-Khawarij militants from the Afghan side.
While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), did not release an official statement about the operation, local residents confirmed the clashes between security forces and militants in the area.
According to the residents, the clashes between the security forces and the militants, which continued for several hours, left one child wounded.
They said that the injured child — identified as Muhammad Khan, son of Abdur Rouf — was first taken to Larkholozo Hospital and later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
The security forces’ fresh action against militants in Bajaur came about a week after a bomb explosion targeted a government vehicle in the Sadiqabad area of Khar tehsil on July 2, killing five people, including Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail and Tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, and injuring 17 others, including four policemen.

• Gohar finally meets party founder, asks supporters to prepare for ‘peaceful but powerful’ campaign
• Aleema says Imran’s sons, family will also join movement
ISLAMABAD: As PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday met party founder Imran Khan in Adiala jail after more than a month of repeated attempts to gain access to the incarcerated former premier, who is said to be kept in solitary confinement, the party founder issued a nationwide protest call.
The meeting between the two party leaders revolved around the protest movement announced by Imran Khan, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases. According to a statement on his X account in the evening, Imran Khan ruled out any kind of dialogue, saying the time for dialogue had passed.
“For the sake of the country, I have repeatedly talked about negotiations, but now the time for negotiations has passed. After the 26th Constitutional Amendment…the hope we had for justice from the courts has completely disappeared, so now no other method can bring the Pakistani nation out of this swamp of lawlessness except a nationwide protest movement,” the PTI founder said. It is pertinent to note that he does not have access to his social media accounts and someone else posts on his behalf.
“The complete plan of action for the nationwide movement will be presented this week - on August 5, my unjust imprisonment will complete 2 years. This day will be the culmination of our nationwide protest movement,” he said. “Now there will be no negotiations of any kind with anyone! There will be protests only on the streets so that the nation can get rid of the puppet rulers imposed by force,” he added.
 






Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Barrister Gohar confirmed that the PTI founder asked party workers, supporters, and the general public to prepare for a peaceful but powerful protest campaign starting August 5. “This is not just about political revenge anymore—it’s about every citizen’s rights being stolen. The founder has said this movement should now take the shape of a second Pakistan Movement,” Barrister Gohar stated. He revealed that Khan, even while in solitary confinement, remained “mentally sharper and more determined than ever” and “despite being silenced, the founder has given us a message—prepare, mobilise, and raise your voice peacefully but fearlessly”.
The PTI leader also criticised the prison authorities for continued mistreatment and isolation of Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, while also highlighting their prison conditions, disregard of court orders, and systemic efforts to break political resistance through isolation.
Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, who did not meet her brother, also spoke to media persons outside the jail alongside her sisters. She also talked about the protest movement announced by her brother, claiming that the entire family will be a part of the movement. Ms Khan said that Imran’s sons, Qasim and Suleiman, will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of the movement and Imran Khan had been informed about this. However, Ms Khan did not clarify if the duo will join the movement before Aug 5 or after. She said a plan regarding their visit was being formulated.
‘Solitary confinement’
Ms Khan also painted a grim picture of her brother’s conditions in prison. “He has been kept in complete solitary confinement for months. For the past week, even his newspapers, books, and television have been taken away. What sort of justice is this?” she asked.
She revealed that despite repeated legal requests and court directives, even basic human rights were being denied. “He is not a criminal. He is the former elected prime minister of this country. Yet he is being treated worse than convicted felons,” she claimed.
 
 

Ms Khan said that the PTI founder had told her during a previous brief meeting that his books were lying in the deputy superintendent’s room, inaccessible to him. “What threat do books pose to the state?” she questioned. “His voice is being silenced, his mind is being isolated, and now they want to completely disconnect him from the outside world.” “Even his doctor has not been allowed for 10 months,” he alleged.
Both Ms Khan and Barrister Gohar emphasised that Imran Khan’s health was being deliberately ignored. “For ten months, his personal physician—who has known his medical history for decades—has been denied access. If something happens, who will be responsible?” Ms Khan asked.
She also stated that Bushra Bibi was undergoing similar conditions in her prison cell. “She has been kept in solitary confinement as well. There are no visitors, no sunlight, no communication—just absolute seclusion. Is this how women are treated in custody in Pakistan?”
She said the authorities believe that by isolating the PTI founder, they can dismantle his influence and demoralise his supporters.
“Let me tell you clearly: he cannot be broken.
His spirit is stronger than ever. He told us—whatever happens, his message will reach the people,“ Ms Khan said, referring to Imran Khan’s recent communication from prison.

• Rapid melting of glaciers due to record temperatures causes floods in Hunza, Diamer, Chilas, Nagar
• Karakoram Highway blocked at multiple points; locals evacuated as homes damaged
• Downpour leads to urban flooding in several parts of Punjab
GILGIT / LAHORE: Record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
The melting of ice, which resulted in glacier lake outburst floods (Glofs), blocked roads, damaged homes and left people stranded across GB on Tuesday.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), high temperatures were recorded across GB last week.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn the situation in GB is “unusual” this year.
He said high temperatures have increased the risk of flooding in rivers and streams, particularly in Diamer and Gilgit.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
Currently, the water level in rivers and streams across the region is dangerously high as inflows have increased due to rapidly melting glaciers.
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gandlu-Muladad Padi near Chilas on Tuesday.
A flood in Hamari stream damaged the Nagar Khas Valley road, while deluge in Supultar nullah blocked the Hoper Valley road.
The rising water level in rivers blocked the Chipurson Valley road in upper Hunza while Siachen Road in Ghanche was severely affected by river erosion in Thugs and Bangilongba areas.
Flooding in the Botogah nullah in Chilas damaged makeshift bridges, leaving the communities without any route to cross the waterway.
Flooding in Hamari and Supultar nullahs in Nagar damaged agricultural land, irrigation and drinking water supply systems, link roads and public and private infrastructures.
Many areas were without water and electricity supply after damage to the infrastructure.
Local administration said continued land erosion in the Hamorkhay area in Nagar Khas has submerged fields, trees and other infrastructure and was threatening over a dozen households.
Flood also damaged public and private properties in Chilas of Diamer, Chipurson areas.
A Glof from Shishper glacier in Hassanabad nullah, Hunza, has once again threatened KKH and local properties.
GBDMA said four houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure following the Glof event.
The local administration has warned people not to travel to affected areas as the risk of flooding and land erosion is high.
Rescue efforts
Mr Hussain, the head of GBDMA, said the authority has mobilised machinery to reopen roads blocked by flooding.
“Our first responsibility is to save the lives of people,” he said, adding locals in affected areas have been shifted to safe places.
The GBDMA was also restoring irrigation channels as a majority of people in the region depended upon agriculture as their livelihood.
According to Mr Hussain, the agency is now looking to identify the behaviours of glaciers to understand the scientific reasoning for melting.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has been requested to provide equipment for the monitoring of glaciers.
Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered the GBDMA, district administration and all relevant departments to remain alert in view of the floods.
All deputy commissioners have been ordered to take timely steps to prevent damage to life and property.
Urban flooding in Punjab
In Punjab, heavy monsoon rainfall on Tuesday triggered urban flooding in several cities as the province braces for above-average rainfall in the coming days.
In Lahore, rainfall led to waterlogging in Jail Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Liberty Chowk, and Lakshmi Chowk.
According to the Met Department, Jail Road and Qurtaba Chowk received the most rainfall, with 46 and 43 mm, respectively.
The average rainfall in the provincial capital on Tuesday was 40mm.
The deluge overwhelmed drainage systems in several areas, forcing the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) workers to install pumps to drain water from inundated areas.
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad has directed round-the-clock drainage of water.
He said all resources must be deployed to protect low-lying neighbourhoods from inundation.
Across Punjab, the rainfall pattern showed sharp variations, with Sheikhupura recording the province’s highest total at 48mm.
The provincial government has put all disaster response agencies on high alert after Lahore and several other districts recorded heavy downpours, with Nishtar Town receiving the highest rainfall at 52mm.
PDMA meeting
In Sialkot, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) DG Irfan Ali Kathia held an emergency meeting on the preparedness of local authorities.
Mr Kathia said the province is expected to receive 40 to 60 per cent above-normal rainfall in the coming days.
The heavy rain is expected to result in flooding, particularly in riverine areas near Head Marala, where water flow was 70,000 cusecs on Tuesday.
Local administrations have established relief camps stocked with food and water supplies, while electricity poles have been reinforced.
In rural areas, special teams have been mobilised to protect livestock and ensure their safety during the monsoon.
Gujranwala Division Commissioner Naveed Haider Shirazi has ordered the immediate evacuation of dilapidated buildings.
“We cannot risk any loss of life due to structural collapses during these rains,” Mr Shirazi warned, noting that 16 million residents in his division were potentially at risk.
The authorities have warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and report flooding immediately.
CM’s directives
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed all institutions to remain on alert during the monsoon season.
Officials of Wasa, PDMA, local government, Rescue 1122 and traffic police must remain in the field to oversee relief activities and help citizens.
She further directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners to monitor water drainage from low-lying areas and the traffic police should prepare plans to avoid gridlock.

The decision about the programme was made during a meeting of the local government and rural development department here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair, according to an official statement.
The other participants included cabinet members, the chief secretary, administrative secretaries of the relevant departments, and officials of the local government department.
Mr Gandapur termed the initiative a significant step towards improving sanitation services to ensure cleanliness across village councils at rural areas of the province.
In the first phase, the programme will be implemented in 2,061 rural union councils with an initial estimated cost of Rs5.5 billion.

CM says initiative to ensure cleanliness, provide jobs to thousands of people

During the briefing, it was informed that under the programme, a sanitation workforce of four individuals per union council will be hired on a daily wage basis through a transparent recruitment process. This workforce will be responsible for door-to-door collection of solid waste and its transportation to the designated collection points managed by tehsil municipal administrations. Every union council will initially be provided with one loader vehicle and other necessary equipment for waste collection and sanitation.
The programme’s implementation will be supervised by the respective assistant commissioner, tehsil municipal officer and assistant director (local government).
The participation of elected local government representatives and relevant committees will also be ensured to enhance the programme’s success. Also, an effective monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee its execution.
The meeting was informed that the programme will be formally launched immediately after approval in the upcoming provincial cabinet meeting. In the second phase, the programme will be extended to union councils in the hilly regions of the province.
About the significance of the initiative, the chief minister said that it was a signature programme of the provincial government.
“For the first time in the history of the province, sanitation services are being introduced in rural areas. I hope that the programme will be formally launched by August 14 this year,” he said.
Mr Gandapur said that the initiative would not only ensure cleanliness in rural areas but also provide employment opportunities to thousands of people.
He directed authorities to take all necessary steps for timely implementation of the programme in accordance with the defined timelines.
The chief minister said that transparency and strict adherence to rules and regulations must be ensured in the recruitment of sanitation workers.
He said that a realistic and sustainable strategy should be devised to ensure the long-term continuity of the programme.
Meanwhile, the provincial government has officially launched a digital identity system, Khyber Pass.
A formal ceremony marking the inauguration of the system was held at the Chief Minister’s House on Tuesday, where Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur formally launched the Khyber Pass digital platform.
The ceremony was attended by Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Information Technology Shafqat Ayaz, members of the provincial cabinet and provincial assembly, and senior government officials.
According to the official statement, Khyber Pass is the first-of-its-kind digital identity system in Pakistan on the basis of a QR code mechanism. It will be integrated with Nadra and other government databases, enabling citizens to access all their identity-related information online. With this system, citizens will no longer need to repeatedly provide personal information to avail government services.
Through a single Khyber Pass digital account, residents will be able to access all public services offered by the provincial government.
The unified QR code will serve as a gateway to services such as health, education, taxation, licensing, property records and more, eliminating the need for multiple registrations or form submissions. Citizens will no longer have to visit different offices or wait in long queues, as services will be accessible online through a single digital ID.

An additional district judge, Liaqat Ali, ruled that plaintiff Asfandyar Wali Khan had got a cause of action and was entitled to the decree.
While Mr Asfandyar sought recovery of Rs100 million as damages and Rs50 million as aggravated damages, the court decreed the suit only to the tune of Rs1 million as general damages.
Mr Asfandyar had sued the PTI leader through his counsels Tariq Afghan and Sajeed Afridi, for alleging in a presser on July 25, 2019, that the ANP chief had “sold Pashtuns for $25 million.”

PTI leader had accused ANP leader of ‘selling Pashtuns for $25m’

Mr Yousafzai was the spokesman for the then PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Any false statement against the leader of a party with stature of Asfandyar Wali Khan, definitely hurts the reputation of the leader but also hurts the feelings of vast majority of workers, who always look at their leader as a man of principles and character and rightly do so,” the court observed in its 11-page detailed judgement.
The counsels for Mr Asfandyar told the court that their client was the son of Pakhtun leader Khan Abdul Wali Khan and the grandson of Pakhtun leader Bacha Khan, both prominent leaders of international repute in the Independence Movement.
They said that Mr Asfandyar had served as a member of National Assembly four times and as a senator and a member of KP Assembly once. 
The lawyers insisted that the defendant made the defamatory accusation against their client intentionally to “adversely affect his reputation in the public mind and lower his status in public.”
The defendant, Shaukat Yousafzai, alleged that the suit had been brought by the plaintiff just to harass, humiliate and give mental torture to him.
He claimed that he had only quoted the words and phrases used by the leader of ANP namely late Mohammad Azam Khan Hoti published in different newspapers as well as uttered in different talk shows and that no opinion or statement was made by him in personal capacity against the plaintiff, therefore, he couldn’t be held responsible for the said allegations.
The judge observed that perusal of the extracts of the news made it clear that no reference to statement of Mohammad Azam Hoti had been given by the defendant, rather plain statement had been recorded that ‘Asfandyar Wali had sold Pashtuns for $25 million.’
The court observed that during cross examination, the defendant had admitted that in the newspapers concerned, there was no reference to allegations made by Mr Hoti.
“Defendant himself had been associated with print media for a long time, before coming to politics. Had there been any misstatement or incomplete statement he should have corrected the same,” the judge ruled.
The judge further observed that the defendant in his written statement as well as in his earlier statement expressed respect towards plaintiff and his family, which provided grounds to substantially reduce the quantum of damages.
“Yet the fact remains that defendant should have avoided issuing allegations that are not based upon solid grounds,” the judge observed.
The court also overruled the defendant’s stance that legal action should have been taken against Mr Hoti instead of him, observing that a responsible minister should not pass on allegations of serious nature without proof.
It is pertinent to mention that last year the court had decreed the suit in favour of Mr Asfandyar ex-parte, however, on the application of the defendant the suit was again restored and the defendant was allowed to put forward his defence.

The remains of the pterosaur, roughly the size of a small seagull, and the other creatures were discovered in Petrified Forest National Park, a place famous for producing fossils of plants and animals from the Triassic Period including huge tree trunks. The newly found fossils are 209 million years old and include at least 16 vertebrate species, seven of them previously unknown.
The Triassic came on the heels of Earth’s biggest mass extinction 252 million years ago, and then ended with another mass extinction 201 million years ago that wiped out many of the major competitors to the dinosaurs, which achieved unquestioned supremacy in the subsequent Jurassic period. Both calamities apparently were caused by extreme volcanism.
The fossils, entombed in rock rich with volcanic ash, provide a snapshot of a thriving tropical ecosystem crisscrossed by rivers on the southern edge of a large desert. Along with the pterosaur were other new arrivals on the scene including primitive frogs, lizard-like reptiles and one of the earliest-known turtles — all of them resembling their relatives alive today. This ecosystem’s largest meat-eaters and plant-eaters were part of reptile lineages that were flourishing at the time but died out relatively soon after. While the Triassic ushered in the age of dinosaurs, no dinosaurs were found in this ecosystem, illustrating how they had not yet become dominant.
“Although dinosaurs are found in contemporaneous rocks from Arizona and New Mexico, they were not part of this ecosystem that we are studying,” said paleontologist Ben Kligman of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, who led the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“This is peculiar, and may have to do with dinosaurs preferring to live in other types of environments,” Kligman added. This ecosystem was situated just above the equator in the middle of the bygone supercontinent called Pangaea, which later broke apart and gave rise to today’s continents.
Pterosaurs, cousins of the dinosaurs, were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, followed much later by birds and bats. Pterosaurs are thought to have appeared roughly 230 million years ago, around the same time as the earliest dinosaurs, though their oldest-known fossils date to around 215 million years ago in Europe.
The newly identified pterosaur, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, is thought to have hunted fish populating the local rivers. Its partial skeleton includes part of a tooth-studded lower jaw, some additional isolated teeth and the bones of its elongated fingers, which helped form its wing apparatus. Its wingspan was about three feet (one meter) and its skull was about four inches (10 cm) long. It had curved fangs at the front of its mouth for grabbing fish as it flew over rivers and blade-like teeth in the back of the jaw for slicing prey. The researchers said Eotephradactylus would have had a tail, as all the early pterosaurs did.

The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice, which met under the chairmanship of Senator Farooq H. Naek, considered the Pak­istan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri.
A proposed amendment to Sec­tion 323 of the Pakistan Penal Code, seeks to substitute minimum blood money from 30,630 grams of silver to 2,000 grams of gold or one fourth of the assets held by the convict.  
The bill also seeks to amend Sec­tion 330 of the PPC, by adding a new proviso and explanation. It also proposes to amend Section 331 to redu­­ce the time for payment of diyat in ins­­talments from five years to one year. 

CII chairman opposes bill but says final opinion will be given after council’s meeting

Senator Kamran Murtaza of JUI-F opposed the bill saying that the payment of diyat according to silver value has an Islamic background and its conversion to gold was a non-issue.
He said the 30,630 grams value was the minimum and the heirs of victim may refuse to accept the minimum and ask for more for a compromise. 
The chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) also opposed all the three proposed amendments but said a final opinion will be given after a meeting of CII.
He also submitted a report to the committee which says that according to Islamic principles, the diyat payment can be made as per value of silver, gold and camels, and excluding expression of silver would be un-Islamic. 
It also says the government cannot keep the diyat amount with it if the heirs are free to forego. It says the time for payment of diyat should neither be one year nor five years and it should be fixed at three years. 
Senator Shahadat Awan of PPP said the Chairman of CII has expressed his personal opinion. He said it was an important Islamic and legal matter and a decision on this must not be taken in haste.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, the bill’s mover, said the issue of blood money has long been a matter of concern for both jurists and the judiciary.
Ms Zehri highlighted that the bill seeks to modernise the valuation mechanism of diyat taking into account contemporary economic conditions and the spirit of Shariah.
The statement of objects and reasons clarified that since traditional assets like camels, gold, and silver have fluctuated significantly in value and accessibility, a modern framework is essential to ensure fairness for both victims’ families and offenders. 
It is also necessary to create deterrence so that no one simply pays blood money and gets away, while the victim’s family suffers.
The committee recognised that the minimum amount of diyat must be consistent with Sharia stipulations and any amendment must strictly adhere to the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sharia. 
Given the sensitive nature of the matter, the committee resolved to defer further deliberations to allow for comprehensive input from all relevant stakeholders.
The ministry of interior will be invited to share their viewpoints, particularly on the practical implementation of the proposed amendments. 
Furthermore, the committee sought the final opinion of the CII, so that no legislation on diyat falls outside the bounds of Quranic principles.
The ministry of law was directed to compile a comparative chart on values of silver, gold, etc., and to outline the prevailing practices in other Muslim countries.

The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
Iqbal presided over a preliminary meeting today under the prime minister’s directions to celebrate this year’s Independence Day with “full national spirit and renewed resolve”.
Senior representatives from the Inter-Services Public Relations, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of National Heritage and Culture, Ministry of Education and Professional Training, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination and other departments participated in the meeting to discuss how to make the day “truly reflective of the feelings, aspirations and pride of the people of Pakistan”, according to a press release.
Iqbal said that this year’s Independence Day was being dedicated to the theme of “Marka-i-Haq” to “honour the courage, faith, and resolve of the nation”.
He said that the celebrations would send a “clear message to the world that Pakistan stands proud, strong and committed to its sovereignty”.
The minister added that at the same time, the government aimed to highlight the steady progress being made in economic recovery, defence resilience and international recognition of the country’s leadership, financial stabilisation and expertise, showing that Pakistan’s journey was “not just about survival but about rising to its full potential”.
While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, the minister emphasised that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.
“A robust discussion took place where the committee members shared the planned activities and innovative ideas for celebrations at the federal and provincial levels,” the press release said, adding that Iqbal said that a comprehensive plan should be developed with budgets.
“This year, we are not just commemorating another Independence Day; we are marking a moment of national revival. A moment that reflects the resilience of our people, the resolve of our state, and the rise of Pakistan as a global voice of strength, peace, and purpose. The world has seen that while Pakistan is a peace-loving nation, it will never compromise on its sovereignty. Our recent defence of our territorial integrity showed our maturity, strength, and our determination to protect regional stability without weakness.
“We must use this opportunity to honour the spirit of ‘Marka-i-Haq’, a defining chapter in our history where our armed forces, our citizens, our government, and every institution stood together. We are also seeing concrete gains across the board: inflation is down, exports are growing, digitisation is transforming governance and innovation is thriving. This is the time to celebrate Pakistan across every field, including military, economic, cultural and scientific and to tell our story to the world with pride and ambition.”
He emphasised that the celebrations must be unified. “One voice, one pride from every district, every province and every corner of the globe where Pakistanis live, so the world hears the unmistakable confidence of one nation standing tall.”
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while addressing the meeting’s participants: “The nation stands as one united, unshaken, and ready to defeat any designs against it. Our civil and military forces are shoulder to shoulder. These celebrations will reiterate to the world what they are already telling us that we are united and strong,”
Information Minister Ataullah Tarar shared that extensive plans were underway with song competitions, special programming and a documentary. He assured the meeting’s members that the celebrations would be reflective of the country’s achievements and “celebrate the global acclaim the country is receiving”.
The participants shared a range of proposals to ensure that the celebrations reflected the “hearts of ordinary Pakistanis and involve everyone” from the cities to the villages, from students to artists, and from businesses to the diaspora.
Plans were also discussed for national songs, dramas, poetry gatherings, documentaries, cultural fairs, public events, school competitions and global embassy activities, “all designed to inspire the nation and tell its story to the world”.</p><small>2025-07-08 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0821205446637ed.jpg?r=214753' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922856/two-drown-in-kp-as-flash-floods-hit-province-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Two drown in KP as flash floods hit province, GB</strong></a><br><p>Two boys drowned in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mansehra, while the Karakoram Highway was blocked due to heavy landsliding in the Gligit-Baltistan’s Gonar farm and Mola Dad Pari area on Tuesday.
Due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have triggered flash floods and landslides in various areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to the extreme weather.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Amir Khadam told Dawn.com, “An eight-year-old boy, Ibrahim, drowned in the Jabba nullah due to a sudden surge in the water flow in a dried stream.”
He said the search for the drowned boy continued, and Rescue 1122 teams were making efforts for it.
Torghar Rescue 1122 spokesperson Atiqullah Afridi said, “A young man, Mohammad Zamin, drowned in the River Indus due to an increase in the water flow of the river.”
He said the rescue divers were in the field and struggling to retrieve the body of the man.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Assistant Director Imtiaz Ali said that floods hit multiple areas in the Diamer region and heavy flooding was reported in Ghushay nullah, Batogah nullah, and Khinar nallah, which washed away water supply schemes and other infrastructure. However, he added that the damage from the floods was being assessed.
He continued that the Karakoram Highway was blocked at five different locations after flash floods brought massive debris and mud between Gilgit and Chilas of GB, suspending the traffic on both sides of the crucial route.
The GBDMA official said that the heavy machinery was being engaged in the road clearance work, and work was underway.
He added that no human loss was reported from anywhere in the area due to flooding.
Zubair Ahmad Khan, GBDMA assistant director for Hunza in Nagar region, said that it was reported that the main road leading to Hopper valley had been blocked at Supultar Nullah due to a heavy flood, accompanied by mudflow and large boulders.
“The flood occurred intermittently throughout the afternoon,” he said, adding, “The debris flow had now nearly stopped; however, the water level is still high, making it impossible to commence road clearance operations at this stage.”
He further said that the tehsildar, naib tehsildar, and Communication and Works (C&W) Department sub-engineer are present on-site, and the GBDMA excavator is available at the location.
“Restoration and clearance work will start tomorrow morning, subject to further improvement in water conditions,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan ordered relevant departments to remain alert in view of flood situation, according to a statement by his office.
“Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all relevant departments including the GBDMA and district administrations to remain alert in view of the flood situation in different areas due to melting of glaciers and rise in river levels due to increase in heat intensity,” the statement read.
Deputy commissioners and relevant officers should take timely steps to prevent losses due to floods, Khan said, adding that departments should utilise all resources to initiate the timely rescue and rehabilitation process in any emergency situation.
On Sunday, six people were killed while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and KP, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) in both the provinces.
More than 22 people were killed and 11 others were injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0821284843611c9.jpg?r=212939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922858/govt-approves-four-potential-bidders-for-struggling-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves four potential bidders for struggling PIA</strong></a><br><p>The government said on Tuesday it had approved four parties, including business groups and a military-backed firm, to potentially bid for a stake in debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines.
The government has been seeking to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.
It would be the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Among the bidding groups, one is a consortium of major industrial firms Lucky Cement, Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement and Metro Ventures.
Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.
Additionally, Fauji Fertiliser Company, a military-backed conglomerate, and Pakistani airline Airblue have been approved to bid for PIA.
“The pre-qualified parties will now proceed to the buy-side due diligence phase,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali said in a statement from his ministry.
The review process is set to last two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025, Ali previously told Reuters.
The privatisation ministry also said that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved the transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel located in New York, including options for both outright sale and long-term lease.
From the Roosevelt Hotel, Pakistan is expecting over $100 million as a first payment during this year, Ali previously told Reuters.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613057-chief-justices-of-all-four-high-courts-sworn-in' target='_blank'><strong>Chief justices of all four high courts sworn in</strong></a><br><p>
