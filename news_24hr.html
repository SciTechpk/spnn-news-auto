The attack occurred on one of the city’s busiest roads just after 8am. Video footage of the incident showed one terrorist, clad in a chaddor, approaching the gate and detonating himself. Seconds later, two other terrorists tried to enter the compound.
The attack occurred as an assembly for the first working day of the week was being held at the main compound.
“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate, while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said while speaking to reporters.
He further said that three FC men had been martyred in the suicide attack at the gate, while two others were injured. He added that a clearance operation had been carried out.
Asked whether a threat alert had been issued prior to the incident, the police official said, “You are aware of the overall situation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the country, so we are on high alert. They were unable to enter [the headquarters] due to this alertness. They were neutralised at the gate.”
The Jamatul Ahrar faction of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.
The paramilitary force, originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary, was renamed by the government in July. The headquarters of the force is located in a crowded area, close to a military cantonment. The headquarters building houses barracks, hospitals, and residential quarters.
Meanwhile, an emergency was declared at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar’s largest public sector hospital, and Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH).
The spokesmen of the hospitals confirmed that 11 injured had been brought to LRH while one injured person had been brought to KTH.
Today’s incident is the second major terrorist attack on a security installation in Peshawar in the last three years. In February 2023, 84 people were killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines.
Terror attack condemned
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office.
“Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured.
He reaffirmed that the government remained resolute in eradicating terrorism, and vowed to crush any terrorist plots against Pakistan.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.
He affirmed that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.
 






Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to the TTP.
In a statement condemning the attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the sacrifices of the martyred personnel would always be remembered.
Naqvi also paid tribute to the “brave soldiers of FC, who foiled the Fitna-Al-Khwarij attack by taking timely action”. He also expressed “heartfelt sympathies for the families of the martyred”.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, paid tribute to the martyrs and security forces, stressing that “such cowardly attacks can not weaken our morale”.
Their sacrifice would not go in vain, he said, vowing to bring the terrorists to justice and continuing the war against terrorism with a “stronger resolve”.
CM Afridi affirmed that the provincial government stood with the police and law enforcement agencies, adding that “every resource available will be utilised to eliminate terrorism”.
The chief minister directed authorities to treat the injured and prayed for the families of the martyrs.
Later, he attended the funeral prayers of the martyred personnel, a statement issued by the CM’s Office said.
It added that CM Afridi paid tribute to the martyrs and said that their sacrifices “strengthen our resolve against terrorism”.
 






He also visited LRH before attending the funeral prayers and spoke to the media.
The CM said,“Terrorists have always intended to disturb peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan […]Those who will resort to this are our and Pakistan’s enemies, and we will not let them do this.
“They cannot weaken our resolve and courage.”
Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi said: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.”
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi posted on X that he “strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist attack on the FC Headquarters in Peshawar. Such acts of violence are an affront to the peace and security of our nation”.
“I commend the swift and courageous response of the FC personnel, which successfully prevented a greater tragedy. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs, and pray for the swift and full recovery of all those injured in this attack.
“Let there be no doubt: neither cowardly attacks nor external threats can weaken our resolve. The entire nation, and especially the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he added.
 






In its condemnation, the PTI termed the attack “unfortunate”. The party posted on X that it extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured.
“We salute the sacrifices of our security institutions and are standing with them for the protection of our country,” the party’s statement read.
 






PPP’s Sherry Rehman also condemned the attack. “Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs. We all laud the courageous defenders from our security forces whose vigilance prevented the suicide bombers from going inside to pursue their nefarious goals,” she said in a post on X.
“No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve,” she said.
 






PPP Chairperson and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack, saying that “such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve” to end terrorism.
A statement on the PPP’s official X account further quoted him as saying: “The PPP will continue its struggle for the elimination of terrorism, safety of the people and lasting peace in the country.
“Our nation’s unity, courage and resolve against terrorism will ensure the failure of every conspiracy by terrorists.”
Bilawal also paid tribute to the martyred FC personnel and said their “sacrifices will not go in vain”. He prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, as well as for those injured in the attack, the statement said.
 






Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on X: “I unequivocally condemn this morning’s despicable terrorist attack on the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Peshawar, which claimed the lives of three brave personnel and left two others wounded. My deepest condolences go to the bereaved families of the shaheeds (martyrs), and I pray for the early recovery of the injured.”
He further said, “Although terrorism has intensified in recent years, a disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks with first the Cadet College in Wana, then the blast at Islamabad’s district courts, and now this assault on the FC Headquarters. These are not random acts, they are part of a calculated campaign by enemies of Pakistan who are exploiting our vulnerabilities.”
The senator asserted that “at this critical juncture, the country expects complete transparency, effective intelligence coordination, and decisive action so that those who plan and finance these attacks are brought to justice, no matter where the trail leads. We want our troops and law enforcement agencies to focus singularly on eliminating the menace of the TTP and its affiliates.”
 






Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Today’s incident comes less than three months after a similar one in September, during which six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Bannu.
According to the military, the attack was carried out by “Indian proxy *Fitna-al-Khawarij”.*

According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies.
Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases.
In separate but similar statements, PM Shehbaz congratulated the PML-N candidates for their victories in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), and Faisalabad’s PP-98, PP-116 and PP-115.
The statements issued by the PM’s Office said the premier congratulated the candidates for their “brilliant success”.
The statements quoted him as saying that the PML-N’s success in the by-polls was a result of party supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision and “exemplary leadership”, as well as the hard work of party workers.
“The success in the by-elections reflects public trust in Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s hard work for the progress of people of the province,” he said, adding that the public had expressed confidence in the PML-N during the by-polls.
“The success in elections is a reflection of the public confidence in the government’s performance,” he reiterated.
Separately, he mentioned the PML-N’s win in NA-143 (Sahiwal), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and NA-129 (Lahore), saying that the people expressed confidence in the “PML-N’s objectives of development, stability, and public welfare” during the by-elections.
Here, too, he credited Nawaz’s leadership and Maryam’s hard work for these wins.
PTI alleges polling discrepancies in Haripur
On Monday morning, the provisional results for NA-18 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur were also issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), according to which PML-N’s Babar Nawaz Khan secured victory with 163,996 votes.
The Form-47 for the constituency — the provisional consolidated statement of results for vote count of all polling stations prepared by the returning officer (RO) concerned — showed that PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub was the first runner-up with 120,220 votes.
Shehrnaz is the wife of PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the NA opposition leader. The seat had fallen vacant following Ayub’s disqualification.
Shehrnaz had contested the polls against PML-N’s Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk with the “kettle” symbol. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings.
 
 

Speaking to reporters today, Ayub rejected the results and said he would challenge them before a court tribunal and launch a series of peaceful protests.
“The returning officer (RO) stole our election,” he alleged, asserting that his wife was ahead of her PML-N rival by over 27,000 votes from over 500 polling stations.
The PTI leader said that their candidate’s results were changed: “We have the Form-45s of all polling stations but the results compiled by the RO and displayed on screen were totally different.”
In an earlier video statement, Ayub had said that the RO was “refusing to accept the original Form-45s and saying he will only acknowledge the forms brought to him”.
“They have prepared duplicate Form-45s,” Ayub alleged.
 






Senior PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser also “rejected” the by-election results in a statement and termed the voting process “fraudulent and ridden by rigging”.
He described the by-polls as a “flagrant violation of the constitutional rules for conducting the voting process in the country”.
Qaiser said the handling of the by-election reflected “open rigging and has once again exposed its dark face before the nation“.
In a separate post on X, Qaiser claimed that the Form-45s showed Shehrnaz was leading by a margin of 25,000 votes from 519 polling stations. However, the ECP staff was “uploading the wrong results on the official website”, he alleged, raising serious questions over the transparency and credibility of the electoral process.
 






Taking note of the low voter turnout in other constituencies, the PTI leader also claimed that the public heeded the party’s call to boycott those by-elections.
He said that reports indicated that voter turnout remained between 15 and 18 per cent, while “over 80pc of citizens rejected the polls, opting to stay home”.
Qaiser termed the elections unrepresentative and demanded that the “non-transparent” results be annulled immediately. He claimed that the present government and the ECP “failed to provide an environment” where citizens could freely choose their leadership.
The former speaker further said that practices of “abductions, arrests, intimidation, restrictions on campaigning, voter manipulation, and tampering with Form-47 are routine” for the ECP.
 






Yesterday, Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz, citing the “posting of presiding officers, other polling staff and changing our election symbol”.
Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including CM Maryam’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Other by-election results
According to provisional results, PML-N candidates emerged victorious in NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-87 (Mianwali-III), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
The provisional results for NA-96 (Faisalabad-II) showed PML-N’s Bilal Badar Chaudhry, the brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, won the race with 93,009 votes.
He was competing against 15 aspirants, among whom independent candidate Nawab Sher bagged 43,025 votes to come out as the first runner-up.
 






For PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), the Form-47 showed that PML-N’s Azad Ali Tabassum had secured victory, bagging 44,388 votes and beating independent candidate Muhammad Ajmal by a margin of 9,142 ballots.
The PPP, which had contested in Haripur’s NA-18, DG Khan’s NA-185 and Muzaffargarh’s PP-269, managed to emerge victorious on the Muzaffargarh provincial seat.
The ruling PML-N had not fielded any candidate against PPP’s Alamdar Qureshi in the constituency, which was among the by-elections boycotted by the PTI, paving the way for the PPP’s win.
 






Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, said on social media platform X yesterday that if the PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, it would “not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future”.
“In other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!” the election expert added.

• Questions why auditor general’s office remains attached to federal secretariat
• Audit process bogged down by over 6,000 reports a year, minimal PAC follow-up
ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concern over the absence of an internal audit mechanism and weak constitutional and parliamentary audit supervision in Pakistan, warning that these gaps pose major fiduciary risks to public funds estimated at about Rs40 trillion at the federal level and even higher in the provinces.
It has called for a fully independent Office of the Auditor Gen­eral of Pakistan (AGP) to ensure better value for taxpayers’ money.
 
 

In a detailed section in its Governance & Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA), the IMF has identified a series of weaknesses in Pakistan’s internal financial controls, internal and external audit systems and practical subservience of the AGP to the executive despite its constitutional autonomy, besides insufficient capacity and role of the parliamentary oversight through the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
It is therefore unsurprising that cases of financial irregularities, embezzlement and corruption running into trillions of rupees continue to surface year after year.
The Fund said an effective internal control system was essential for creating an environment that ensured appropriate decision-making regarding the use of public resources, with clear accountability for such decisions, including via administrative structures, as well as external oversight by a supreme audit institution and the legislature.
“Both internal and external audits are vital in maintaining the integrity of an organisation’s operations and financial reporting, thereby reducing the risk of corruption,” the Fund observed and highlighted a series of weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
Saying that internal audit was weak in Pakistan, the report noted that the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2019 required the creation of a Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) in each division to work directly with principal accounting officers no later than 2020.
“Despite this provision, there has been no implementation and appointment of CIAs,” the IMF said.
It said that 25 chief finance and accounts officers (CFAOs) were working in ministries for financial management — a distinct role — but CIAs have not been posted in all ministries and divisions and CFAOs are also missing in 15 ministries and divisions. The full implementation of the PFM Act 2019 still remains a dream after six years.
“In addition, ministries and divisions with CFAOs lack consistency, interest, and follow-up on the findings of internal audit reports,” it said. The Fund also questioned why the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was still operating as an attached institution of the Federal Secretariat, which resulted in a lack of full independence.
According to Article 171 of the Constitution and Article 7 of the Pakistan Audit Ordinance, 2001, the AGP has to attest the Appropriation accounts and financial statements of federal, provincial and local governments’ entities and the certified accounts and financial statements of the federal and provincial/local governments are submitted to the president and the governors of provinces, respectively.
“Due to its status as an attached institution, the Auditor General does not report directly to the parliament but instead through the Federal Secretariat, the prime minister, and the president. This indirect reporting structure can potentially compromise the independence and objectivity of the audit process,” it said.
In addition, as an attached institution, the OAG has to obtain approval from the federal Public Service Commission to hire auditors. The OAG complained to the IMF that they faced a significant staffing shortage — a deficit of 1,500 staff members — mainly due to fiscal constraints preventing necessary government approvals for hiring.
Despite the fact that the budget of the Auditor General is classified as charged expenditure, which means it is not subject to a parliamentary vote, the OAG still needs to adhere to budget execution rules. Consequently, they are subject to budget releases by the Finance Division, subject to cash availability.
“This dependency on the Federal Secretariat for budget releases further limits the OAG’s operational independence”, critically important for Supreme Audit Institutions to perform their tasks as needed and required, it said.
As if that was not enough, the effectiveness of the audit process was further being undermined by the excessively long reports that contain repetitive recommendations and the lack of timely review by the PAC.
The Office of the Auditor General produced over 6,000 reports each year, but there was minimal or no follow-up from the Public Account Committee and the ministries and divisions. “As a result, 75 per cent of the 34,000 recommendations made by the Supreme Audit Institution are still pending discussion in the PAC.
Moreover, it pointed out that the audit reports were often too lengthy, with some reaching up to thousands of pages that included repetitive recommendations for years since these irregularities identified in the reports are not addressed by the executive agencies. For instance, the Federal Government Compliance Audit Report for FY2023-24 is 4,000 pages long.
On top of that, there are no systems in place for monitoring the response to or compliance with audit findings and recommendations, which further diminishes the impact and effectiveness of the audit process.
The IMF demanded the development of a system that could make executive authority responsible and accountable in case of non-compliance with audit recommendations as well as PAC directions.
For this, the lender suggested making appropriate amendments to the PAC regulations and AGP Act to empower these institutions to ensure compliance with their directives.
Going forward, the IMF also demanded streamlining audit reports by including concise recommendations for the most critical issues and organising findings by their impact and urgency, using visual tools like traffic light systems to indicate the severity of issues.
In addition, the Fund also demanded strengthening of the parliamentary oversight by mandating the PAC to review audit reports promptly, supported by a tracking system on implementation progress through a centralised secretariat for monitoring and improved transparency and accountability.

On Friday, India’s Tejas fighter jet crashed in a ball of fire in front of horrified spectators during an aerial display at the Dubai Airshow.
The Indian Air Force has said it is setting up a court of inquiry to investigate the cause.
 
 

State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics manufactures the aircraft, which is powered by General Electric engines. Both companies have said they will support the investigation.
Tejas, which means brilliance in Sanskrit, is seen as crucial for India’s efforts to modernise its air force fleet of mainly Russian and ex-Soviet fighters.
The crash, which killed the pilot, dampens New Delhi’s hopes of exporting the home-built jet and leaves it reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of domestic defence technology.
Such a public loss could overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts have said.
Hindustan Aeronautics said on Monday that the crash will not affect its business operations, financials or future deliveries.
Shares of the company, which were trading three per cent lower since morning, were unchanged after the statement.</p><small>2025-11-24 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635129-govt-moves-to-establish-cybersecurity-authority-at-federal-level' target='_blank'><strong>Govt moves to establish Cybersecurity Authority at federal level</strong></a><br><p>

After a day of meetings that kicked off based on a United States’ proposal that was criticised as being in Russia’s favour, negotiators have drafted “an updated and refined peace framework”, a US-Ukraine joint statement said on Sunday.
US President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to approve his plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which began after Russia launched a full-scale invasion.
But Kyiv was seeking changes to the draft that accepted a range of Russia’s hardline demands, with the 28-point plan requiring the invaded country to cede territory, cut its army and pledge never to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).
 
 

“The talks were constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace,” the joint statement said.
“They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,” it said, noting “meaningful progress”.
Both sides pledged to keep working on joint proposals “in the coming days”.
But even as the White House said in a separate statement that the talks marked a “significant step forward”, a Russian drone strike on the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv killed four people, its mayor said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of “tremendous” progress after a day of meetings, while the head of Ukraine’s delegation Andriy Yermak also told reporters the sides had made “very good progress”.
The Ukrainian delegation referred to a new version of the US draft plan, which has yet to be published, saying it “already reflects most of Ukraine’s key priorities”.

Rubio, whose delegation included Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, told reporters that the work to narrow the areas of disagreement had advanced “in a very substantial way”.
“I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” he said, adding: “I honestly believe we’ll get there.”
Rubio stressed that any final agreement would “have to be agreed upon by the presidents, and there are a couple [of] issues that we need to continue to work on” before trying to bring on board the Kremlin, which welcomed the original proposal.
“Obviously, the Russians get a vote.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday. Turkey has hosted three rounds of talks on ending the war.
‘Zero gratitude’ claim
His comments came after Trump earlier lashed out at Ukraine.
“Ukraine ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts,” Trump wrote in uppercase on his Truth Social platform, also accusing European countries of not doing enough to stop the war, but offering no direct condemnation of Moscow.
 






Not long after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that his country was “grateful to the United States… and personally to President Trump” for the assistance that has been “saving Ukrainian lives”.
 






Announcing a deadly Russian drone strike, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram yesterday it was “truly horrible” that despite the negotiations, “Russian troops are attacking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure, residential buildings”.
At the end of the day, Rubio said he thought Trump was “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made”.
Asked about whether he believed a deal could be reached by Thursday, he said the “deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible”.
“I think we made a tremendous amount of progress. I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”
 


European ‘centrality’
The US plan was drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies, who were scrambling on Sunday to make their voices heard and boost Kyiv’s position.
EU countries plan to discuss the Ukraine situation on the sidelines of a meeting with African leaders in Angola today.
“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, stressing that the “centrality” of the European Union’s role must be “fully reflected” in any peace plan.
 






A number of leaders called Trump on Sunday, with Downing Street saying United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the US president had agreed “that we all must work together at this critical moment to bring about a just and lasting peace”.</p><small>2025-11-24 06:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2409244246f5315.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956911/human-trafficking-surge-in-passenger-offloading-irritates-businessmen-and-tourists' target='_blank'><strong>Human trafficking: Surge in passenger offloading irritates businessmen and tourists</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: Nine passengers traveling to an African country to further proceed towards European destinations were offloaded from a flight at the Sialkot International Airport by the Immigration authorities on Sunday.
The rate of offloaded passengers from certain cities, age groups and specific destinations has seen a surge during the last couple of months. However, theheightened alertness by the immigration staff is irritating for genuine businessmen and tourists.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said that the Immigration authorities had identified a group of passengers traveling by flight number FZ316 to African country Djibouti via Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from Sialkot Airport.
 
 

Adding, he said that the passengers namely Tassawar Abbas, Muhammad Siddique, Baber Hussain, Muhammad Saleem, Akhlaq Ahmed, Muqarrabul Hassan, Muhammad Talha, Imran Sikandar and Usman Ali could not satisfy the immigration officials about the purpose of their travel.
During further investigation, they revealed that they had struck a deal with human traffickers and agents in Rs 4.2million each to send them Italy via Libyan Coast on ship as they had to reach Libya after reaching Djibouti.
The offloaded passengers belonged to Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Faisalabad and Sheikhupura districts of Punjab. The passengers were later handed over to the FIA Composite Circle, Gujranwala, for further legal action.
On the other hand a number of genuine businessmen and tourists have lodged a strong protest against the `harsh policy’ to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
President of Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters by the GtCCI.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
Some overseas Pakistanis too have lodged such complaints at the Sialkot and other airports.
President of Uk-Pak Businessmen Chamber Rashid Khan, while speaking to chamber members last week, had narrated his ordeal at the hands of Sialkot Airport staff and lodged strong protest against what he termed a discouraging attitude which should be noticed by the higher authorities.
Some other expatriate Pakistanis belonging to Gujrat region have also complained about the current policy of offloading passengers.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, Gujranwala FIA zone director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.

Panellists explore AI’s promise, perils at Adab Festival</strong></a><br><p>As artificial intelligence continues to reshape daily life, speakers at Karachi’s Adab Festival gathered at Habitt City on Sunday to discuss how the technology has evolved, what it offers, as well as the blind spots and ethical risks it now poses for the future.
The session, titled Designing Tomorrow with Artificial Intelligence, featured Dr Salman Khatani and Sadaf Bhatti, with Ahsan Siddiqui moderating. Entrepreneur Jehan Ara was scheduled to attend but was unable to do so.
Siddiqui began by noting how quickly technological trends shift, recalling earlier waves, from AutoCAD to digital marketing and e-commerce, before today’s AI boom. He pointed out that while people eagerly use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini for tasks such as grammar fixes or image edits, far fewer understand how such systems can be used to create new tools themselves. 
“Change is the only constant,” he said, while raising a broader question about the technology’s origins.
Bhatti traced AI’s emergence to 1956 and the study of neurons; historically, that year is known for John McCarthy coining the term ‘artificial intelligence’ at the first AI conference at Dartmouth College. 
According to Dr Khatani, large language models (LLMs) enable students to access advanced knowledge in local languages, a feature that, for example, allowed him to teach a seven-year-old the concept of relativity in a regional language (something previously unheard of without an LLM). 
“These tools empower the next generation to access knowledge in their native languages and transform their families’ lives,” he said. 
Citing Collins Dictionary’s designation of ‘vibe coding’ as word of the year, he said young people can now design applications and games without knowledge of machine learning or deep learning. “Now humans must return to creativity, diversity and empathy, while machines handle logic and engineering,” he said. 
Vibe coding can be understood as the practice of prompting AI tools to generate code rather than writing code manually. Despite tradeoffs, fewer barriers to entry make it easier for non-specialists to build projects with relative ease. 
Dr Khatani brought up how Nvidia recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company with just 36,000 employees and cited Cursor as an example of how AI enables small teams to achieve massive results. The discussion, however, raised questions about the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. 
As audience member Syed Khawar Mehdi put it: “Unlike the Industrial Revolution, which created jobs on a large scale, in AI’s first phase, we see a concentration of wealth. A very limited number of people are commanding huge resources and fiscal empowerment.”
He also mentioned its misuse in academia and the generation of historically inaccurate content on social media, which Dr Khatani acknowledged as genuine, along with deepfakes, intellectual property issues, and cybersecurity fraud.
Mehdi, who has authored the book ‘Honour-bound to Pakistan in Duty, Destiny and Death’, told Dawn that while he himself uses AI and sees it as extremely beneficial, it is still “a tool in evolution”. 
“We are so excited with the humongous universe that’s unfolding in front of us; we haven’t been able to see its negative side. People are using it rampantly to cheat in colleges and schools. And history is being distorted, which is very alarming,” he said, referring to AI-generated videos on social media that inaccurately depict historical figures from contradicting timelines. 
“People who define society in terms of morals and values, they have to put a foot down in front of science. [AI is] excellent in diagnostics, engineering, teaching, health, administration, water management, space technology. But when it comes to morals, values and societal norms and what defines a society, a civilisation, we as a people have to draw a line. Humans can never be replaced.”</p><small>2025-11-24 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6923a57fb51c6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956969/going-back-in-time' target='_blank'><strong>Going back in time</strong></a><br><p>WITH a series of significant constitutional amendments as well as de facto changes in governance, a distinctive political system is taking shape in Pakistan. The fact that it is authoritarian goes without saying. The exact form of this authoritarianism is worth thinking through.
The bare standard definition of democracy, i.e., a political system where election results generally decide who sits in office, was effectively done away with after the 2024 poll. The existence of significant question marks over the electoral validity of the civilian government marked a clear shift in the ‘hybrid regime’ dynamic in place since 2018.
With time in office dependent on decree rather than election outcomes, parliament itself now operates within the limitations set by an establishment-controlled executive. The legislative agenda, in whatever form it exists, is now centrally ord­a­i­ned rather than deliberated and discussed. The PTI, despite its ballot box performance, stands dis­­­enfranchised and marginalised in this process.
The concluding phase of the system’s transformation comes via the passage of the 26th and 27th amendments. Through these changes, the judiciary in nominal terms is now subject to parliamentary authority. But as laid out above, if parliament is de facto subservient to the executive, that means the judiciary now too is an implementation branch of executive power.

The current configuration of governance is not too dissimilar to what the British envisioned in the early 20th century.

Countries the world over conjure up a variety of different political systems enshrined in their constitutions — presidential, semi-presidential, parliamentary, consociational etc — but all of them have one thing in common: judicial review of the executive. With the latest developments in judiciary-executive relations, thanks to amendment nos. 26 and 27, the last remaining vestiges (mostly a fig-leaf) of constitutionalism stand discarded.
So what are we left with? It’s tempting to think of this as personalised autocracy, or even some 21st-century variant of absolutism. A strongman at the top ruling through a set of vassals, drawing on the power of an inordinately well-funded and organised security apparatus. The historical parallels evoke Bismarck, but the closest contemporary parallels are Middle Eastern dictatorships, especially in Egypt.
But there is a historical instance that resembles the current situation in somewhat similar ways. This instance is in fact from this very region, which makes the comparison more apt. And it won’t be remiss to suggest that the patterns of authority taking root in Pakistan today actually go all the way back to the roots established during an earlier era.
I’m primarily referring to the political system that evolved in the late colonial period, especially through its two main legislative instruments — the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. Conventionally taught in the local curricula as ‘dyarchy’, the system first devolved several aspects of governance to provincial governments, though with varying scope for elected versus non-elected representatives. At the central level, some aspects were handed over to the legislative council, while others (finance, defence, administration) remained under executive authority.
The Government of India Act, 1935, enlarged the role of elected provincial legislatures in gove­r­nance, but maintained executive control on cent­ral subjects. The graduation of the legislative ass­embly to a truly representative governing aut­h­o­r­i­ty never took place. Self-government was thus on­­­­ly made possible with the end of colonial authority.
 
 

Allowing for some liberty in the analogy, Pakistan’s current configuration of governance is not too dissimilar to what the British envisioned in the early 20th century. The provinces have become concessionary arenas for popular politics. Party activity operates somewhat unencumbered, to the extent that even the main opposition to the regime is allowed to retain its government in KP.
NFC transfers help lubricate this politics, with party support being shored up (as in PPP in Sindh and PTI in KP) or being rebuilt from its obliteration (PML-N in Punjab) through patronage and mega projects. Much like in colonial India, elites from the propertied classes use this arena for a variety of political and self-serving objectives. Effectiveness of spending and impact on welfare are secondary concerns.

The current configuration of governance is not too dissimilar to what the British envisioned in the early 20th century.

At the centre, though, the story is entirely different. Here we see the exercise of viceregal authority in full bloom. Parliament serves the same function (with the same degree of potency) that the legislative council historically did. The judiciary’s primary task is to provide exceptions to bypass any fundamental rights. Key decisions on finance, defence, and administration are taken by civilian and military bureaucrats, and the current cabinet resembles the appointed officials of a past era in all but name.
Such authoritarian control coexisting with political federalism, at least for now, seems like an odd combination. Past episodes of dictatorial control tried to centralise authority by undercutting the provinces through steps like the One-Unit scheme or via the curtailment of provincial res­ources). But in many ways, events of the past few years are a reversion of the Pakistani state to its foundational DNA from the early 20th century.
The tragedy here is the direction of change. Each successive Government of India Act enl­arged the space for representative politics, under strong pressure from mass movements of self-rule and independence. The political sphere of that time carried a variety of ideological currents, all of which sought an emancipated future — one in which viceregal authority would give way to the exercise of sovereignty by the people themselves.
Our direction is the opposite. Having enshrined the principles of democratic government and federalism in 1973 (reaffirmed in 2008), the state has now moved in the opposite direction. It has closed off key domains of governance from representative authority, shut off judicial review for its actions, and made parliament largely redundant in form, if not in appearance. Barring any resistance, the next step on this trajectory would take us further back into the late-19th century, when even provincial politics is deemed surplus to requirement. Let’s see what the 28th amendment has in store.

The JI leader Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rehman announced the movement while addressing the final session of the magnificent event that hosted delegates from over 45 countries.
Speaking on the occasion, Engr Naeemur Rehman announced that under the movement rallies, marches and sit-ins will be held across the country.
 






Calling for political reforms, he said that powers should not rest with the bureaucracy but with local governments. He said empowered local governments is the need of the hour and the crucial demand of the movement.
He instructed the party’s provincial leadership in Punjab to begin a movement for local body elections, stating that this is not just Punjab’s issue but that of the entire country.
 
 

He said that in Sindh, KP, and Balochistan too, the elite class has captured all powers, and a movement is needed against this. “The local government system is the need of the time and our principal demand. The success of Jamaat-e-Islami is a need for Pakistan.”
He further announced that under the “Change the System” movement, five million new members would be added and 15,000 public committees created. He demanded constitutional protection for the local government system and instructed the Punjab leadership to prepare for a sit-in in front of the provincial assembly.
Rejecting the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, he said: “We will strongly resist every attempt to deface the 1973 Constitution. We will not allow elections to be hijacked at any cost.”
He said the JI did not accept banning political parties; nor should TLP be banned; neither should Imran Khan be kept in jail for political reasons.

But it did this without any input from Palestinians. Hamas rejected the resolution saying it fails to meet Palestinian rights and demands and “imposes a mechanism to achieve the [Israeli] occupation’s objectives”.
The resolution can only be implemented if Hamas signs up to it. This means complex negotiations lie ahead if the plan is to progress beyond the present ceasefire, which is being violated daily by Israeli forces, who have also been crossing the ‘yellow line’. This has taken the Palestinian death toll to almost 70,000 in the two-year genocidal war imposed by Israel.
The UNSC resolution is short on specifics and ambiguous in key areas. It ignores all previous resolutions on Palestine. It authorises the creation of a vaguely defined transitional governance body, the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump and members decided by him, to oversee a Palestinian “technocratic” committee responsible for day-to-day running of Gaza. It also authorises the BoP to establish a temporary multinational international stabilisation force (ISF) “to deploy under unified command acceptable to the BoP”.
This will not be a UN peacekeeping mission nor be overseen by the UN. Its mandate is unclear and details are lacking on its scope and structure. It is however tasked to “demilitarise the Gaza Strip” and carry out “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, including Hamas.
The original US draft made no reference to Palestinian statehood. But at the insistence of Muslim countries, the final resolution mentions a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. But this is wrapped in so many conditions that it denudes it of real meaning. Weak Arab negotiators failed to get a firm commitment to a Palestinian state in the resolution. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains firmly opposed to any Palestinian state.
The UNSC resolution was welcomed across the world as a step towards peace despite concerns of many countries and Council members, including Pakistan, about its lack of clarity in core areas. China and Russia, who abstained on the vote, both voiced concern about the vague nature of key elements, lack of Palestinian participation and absence of commitment to a two-state solution.

It would be a mistake for Pakistan to send troops for the stabilisation force in Gaza.

China’s ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, said the resolution “does not [reflect] the fundamental principle of Palestinians governing Palestine”. Russia’s UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, described the stabilisation force as “reminiscent of colonial practices”. In a scathing critique, the UN special Rapporteur for Palestine said, “Rather than charting a pathway towards ending the occupation and ensuring Palestinian protection, the resolution risks entrenching external control over Gaza’s governance, borders, security, and reconstruction. The resolution betrays the people it claims to protect.”
 
 

In Gaza itself, the UNSC resolution’s main provisions were viewed with great scepticism, according to Al Jazeera reporters on the ground. One resident told the news outlet “Our people … are able to rule ourselves. We don’t need forces from Arab or foreign countries to rule us”. The transitional governing arrangement is seen as outsiders deciding the fate of Palestinians. The international stabilisation force is viewed with deep suspicion — “not as a guarantee of protection but rather a foreign security arrangement imposed without their consent”.
Of course, it is the stance of Hamas and other Palestinian factions that is consequential for the resolution’s enforcement. Hamas still controls Gaza up to the ‘yellow line’ held by Israel. Its popularity has risen since the ceasefire, according to the latest poll by the West Bank-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. Hamas has rejected the UN resolution on a number of grounds. It said the resolution “imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip”. Assigning the international force to disarm groups resisting the occupation “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”.
Hamas has argued that any international force, if established, “must be deployed only at the borders to separate forces, monitor the ceasefire, and be fully under UN supervision”. “It must also operate exclusively in coordination with official Palestinian institutions.” “Resisting the occupation by all means is a legitimate right guaranteed by international laws and conventions.” Hamas also said disarmament is an “internal matter” linked to the end of occupation and creation of a Palestinian state.
It is possible Hamas may be prepared to disarm in exchange for total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which would end its occupation. But that can only be tested in serious negotiations that have to take place if the UN-endorsed Trump plan is not to collapse.
The expectation from the stabilisation force to demilitarise Gaza and disarm resistance groups is likely to deter several Muslim countries from joining it. Some of them are engaged in talks to contribute to the force. Israel has to approve countries that can be part of the force. So far it has rejected Turkiye’s participation. The international force will be answerable to the BoP and is intended to work with Egypt and Israel to demilitarise the Gaza Strip. That means it can get caught in a shooting war and act like an enforcement force rather than a peacekeeping one. Its task will also be to secure the borders and train the Palestinian police.
There are at least three reasons why Pakistan should not join ISF. One, it should not be part of a force whose key task is to police Hamas, not protect Palestinians. The implications for Pakistan, for example, of any clash between its troops and Palestinians would be serious. Two, deployment would involve close cooperation with Israel and arguably lure Pakistan into a trap to recognise Israel and join the Abraham Accords. Moreover, Israel’s continuing ceasefire violations and occupation of over half of Gaza pose major obstacles to Trump’s plan. In these circumstances, Hamas will not disarm. Walking into such a quagmire would therefore be a mistake for Pakistan.
The challenges facing implementation of the Gaza peace plan are formidable. At this inflection point for the plan, it is uncertain whether it will be able to deliver peace or meet the same fate as so many failed plans for Palestine have in the past.

FAIZ Ahmed Faiz’s immensely popular poem, usually referred to as Hum Dekhenge’, (we shall see), is surrounded by a few misunderstandings. Firstly, contrary to common belief, Faiz had not composed this poem as protest against General Ziaul Haq’s martial law, albeit he was definitely against the regime and had written the poem during Zia’s martial law.
The poem pronounces that the day would come when crowns would be tossed and thrones would be knocked over, which was interpreted as a protest against martial law. But the poem was in fact inspired by Iranian revolution and Faiz had paid tribute to common people who had brought about the revolution.
Presenting Iranian revolution as a proof, he expresses his firm belief that we shall one day see the end of exploitative system and the proletariat would snatch power from the feudal lords.
Secondly, the actual title of the poem is not Hum Dekhenge, but these are the first words in the opening line. The actual title of the poem, written in 1979, is a part of the verse 27 of Quran’s chapter 55 (Surah Rahman).
The poem alluding to the Day of the Judgement intends to remind that the day would come when the justice would prevail and those who committed atrocities would be punished. What inspired Faiz to pen this poem was 1979 Iranian revolution when Iranian monarch Mohammed Reza Pahlavi had to flee the country as millions of people took to street in protest.
Dr Sajid Siddiq Nizami, while explaining the poem in an article, has given the backdrop against which this poem was created. He says that Agha Nasir has mentioned that when he visited Faiz in London in 1979, Faiz handed him over two hand-written poems and asked him to distribute these poems among the friends in Pakistan. Faiz said one of the poems is on Iranian revolution, which had occurred a few months ago.
Agha said the Iranian revolution was an Islamic revolution and how could you write a poem on it (since Faiz was a leftist). Faiz replied a revolution is a revolution, not Islamic or un-Islamic.
When people take to street it becomes a mass revolution. On another occasion, says Dr Nizami, Faiz had commented that after the French revolution the Iranian evolution was the greatest one as it was brought about by general public.
In addition to revolution in Iran, Faiz must have had in his mind, adds Nizami, the situation in Pakistan where an elected government was toppled and the former prime minister was likely to be hanged. The poem became immensely popular when in 1986 Iqbal Bano sang it in a gathering at Lahore. Ever since the poem is considered the voice of the downtrodden and politically oppressed. So much so, that even in India it was recited to voice protest over the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019.
The poem was included in Mere Dil Mere Musafir (1981), a collection of Faiz’s poetry. Iftikhar Arif had the original manuscript of the book, written in hand by Faiz. It was also part of Faiz’s collected works Saare Sukhan Hamaare (London, 1982), but was not included in Nuskha Hai Vafaa (1984), complete poetic works of Faiz.
Perhaps it was a precautionary measure taken by the publisher. Later on, it was included in it but a few lines were abrogated. Dr Nizami’s article analyses the poem and explains that Faiz has used certain Islamic symbols and Sufi motifs to convey the theme.
Nizami’s article is included in an anthology tilted Ghaazaa-i-Rukhsaar-i-Sahar. Published by Lahore’s Collage Publications and compiled by Ghulam Ali — a Lahore-based young scholar — the book proffers 34 articles by renowned critics from India and Pakistan.
Some of the veterans whose article have made it to the anthology include Meera Jee, Syed Sajjad Zaheer, Fateh Muhammad Malik, Ashfaq Husain, Tabassum Kashmiri, Sarvarul Huda, Jabir Ali Syed, Qamar Raees, Ahmed Mehfooz, Aftab Ahmed, Ziaul Hasan, Nasir Abbas Nayyar and some others.
The book is, as mentioned by Nasir Abbas Nayyar in his blurb, a study known as Close Reading, or the in-depth analysis based on linguistic and structural features for deeper understanding.
Faiz died in Lahore on November 20, 1984.

The NDMA has issued an earlier-than-usual monsoon warning, saying that Pakistan could face 22-26pc above-normal rainfall next year. The advisory reminds us how the country faces escalating climate extremes, where each year brings a new ‘record’ of loss and disruption.
After the devastation of 2022, caused by glacial melt and record monsoon rains, and the deadly 2024 floods, driven by stalled monsoon systems that unleashed days of downpour, the prospect of an even harsher season should trigger an immediate shift from reaction to readiness. The NDMA’s disclosure that 3.1m people had to be relocated to safety this year alone speaks to both the scale of the threat and the fragility of Pakistan’s disaster-management architecture.
 
 

Early warnings issued six to eight months in advance will hold little meaning if riverine encroachments still stand, drains stay clogged, and provincial administrations lack the capacity or will to enforce evacuation plans. Tourism restrictions in June and July signal prudence but they are by no means a substitute for resilient infrastructure, local-level preparedness, and coordination across the federation.
The prime minister’s directive to begin early preparations and immediately implement the Ministry of Climate Change’s short-term plan is welcome, but political urgency must be matched by administrative discipline. Pakistan has long suffered from a pattern in which plans are drafted, alerts are issued, meetings are convened and yet the same communities drown each year because enforcement collapses at the provincial and district levels. That pattern must break.
 
 

The proposed meeting of the National Water Council must be more than symbolic. It needs to address the questions of land use, river management, water governance, and resource allocation that successive governments have avoided. With climate-driven hazards intensifying, the margin for complacency has evaporated. We must act now to strengthen embankments before the rivers swell, pre-position relief supplies before roads wash out, and empower local disaster committees before the first cloudburst.
Urban centres too must prepare. Cities like Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar can no longer afford dysfunctional drainage, unchecked construction, and seasonal firefighting. The early warnings for 2026 offer the country an unusual gift: time. Squandering this opportunity would be unforgivable.

• Accuses PPP of using Section 144 to curb political gatherings
• Adil Sheikh terms amendment against judicial independence
KARACHI: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi as part of its ongoing “struggle” across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
A key meeting of TTAP was held under the chairmanship of Syed Zain Shah, the vice chairman of alliance’s Sindh chapter.
Senior leaders including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s (MWM) Allama Sadiq Jaffery, Sindh United Party’s (SUP) Munir Naich, PkMAP’s Sarbaz Abdul Rab, Bashir Khan Tareen and others attended the session.
The forum reviewed the country’s prevailing political and constitutional situation and approved several decisions.
A statement issued after the meeting said that opposition leaders resolved that the TTAP would launch a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi. Key leaders of the TTAP would address the public along the route.
 
 

“The participants of the meeting lauded the people of Sindh for observing Black Day on November 21 and appreciated the ongoing struggle of lawyers across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, TTAP vice chairman and SUP Chief Syed Zain Shah said the three-day rally would travel through multiple cities before reaching Karachi on the third day.
 
 

He said the public had grown weary of the current system, which had been marred by unemployment, economic hardship and rising inflation.
“The 27th Amendment has undermined the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” he added.
He accused the PPP of repeatedly enforcing Section 144 across Sindh to avoid facing the public’s reaction.
“After TTAP announced a public rally in Hyderabad, the sudden imposition of Section 144 throughout the province has proved that the PPP has lost its popular support in Sindh,” he said.
He added that the nationwide movement had now entered a decisive phase and attempts to “suppress public opinion or impose governments on the basis of a fabricated mandate would no longer be tolerated.”
Mr Sheikh of PTI said the 27th Cons­titutional Amendment had “stripped the judiciary of its independence” and that only a people’s struggle could dismantle the system established through a “stolen mandate”.
He said the government was introducing “anti-people” amendments while keeping PTI founder Imran Khan in “unjust imprisonment”.
“These measures will not be accepted under any circumstances,” he said.
Large public gatherings, he said, would be held in several cities during the December campaign.

In a statement, Hamas said it reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in its meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief, but accused Israel of continued violations that it said threatened to undermine the deal.
The delegation, which included exiled Hamas Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya, called for a “clear and defined mechanism” under the supervision of mediators to document and halt any breaches of the deal.
The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a local Hamas commander Alaa Al-Hadidi in Gaza, the head of supply in Hamas’ production headquarters. It said he was killed in one of the attacks across the Gaza Strip.
Hamas did not release a statement on the commander’s reported killing.
FO slams attacks
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office denounced Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza, calling Saturday’s attack that killed at least 21 people a grave breach of international law and a serious blow to ongoing peace efforts.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.” It added that the strikes had resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many others wounded.
 






“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
The statement added that these attacks also undermine international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.

US and Indian officials have signalled that the agreement is expected to be concluded by the end of November, clearing the way for their bilateral trade to reach an intended $500 billion by 2030.
“Pakistan and other South Asian nations are hoping the agreement will also encourage the United States to expand trade with the rest of the region,” one diplomatic source said. “They are looking for even-handed treatment for all.”
According to sources, these regional considerations are among the factors delaying the announcement of a joint US-Pakistan statement on bilateral trade. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan’s talks with the office of the US Trade Representative are ongoing, as both sides work to finalise various points.
Pakistani officials are keen to understand how they could benefit from provisions like reduce tariffs on goods produced with raw materials sourced from the United States, such as fabrics made from US cotton.

Pakistan closely watching implications of the impending agreement

“But now, Pakistanis are no longer pushing for an immediate announcement. Instead, they are waiting for the US-India deal to be finalised,” one source said.
When Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb last visited Washington in October to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Pakistani officials told reporters that the statement would be announced “in weeks, if not days”.
The US-Pakistan trade deal, agreed in principle in July 2025, came into effect on Aug 7. It features reciprocal tariff reductions, particularly benefiting Pakistani exports such as textiles, leather goods, surgical instruments, and agricultural products, while Pakistan rolled back its digital services tax.
Earlier, on Aug 1, Pakistan announced that the US had imposed a 19 per cent tariff on its exports — a reduction from the 29pc rate announced by President Donald Trump in April.
The revised rate was described by Islamabad as a “balanced and forward-looking step” aimed at enhancing Pakistan’s competitiveness in the American market.
In contrast, India initially faced a 26pc “reciprocal” tariff on April 9, which was later raised to 50pc by an executive order on Aug 6, effective since Aug 27, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington cautions that the 2025 reciprocal tariffs may reduce both US and global economic growth while boosting inflation in affected economies. The tariffs disproportionately penalise countries relying on global value chains, as duties are applied to gross export value, including imported inputs.
Another Washington think-tank, CSIS, notes that the “reciprocal” label is misleading: the rates are calculated via a formula based on the US trade deficit with each country, resulting in rates as high as 50pc, far exceeding simple tit-for-tat adjustments.

The first tranche of deals will include projects in Pakistan, Egypt and Europe, the organisation’s chair John Jovanovic told the Financial Times in an interview on Sunday. He added that the West was over-reliant on supplies that “are no longer fair”.
 
 

“We can’t do anything else that we’re trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning,” Jovanovic was quoted saying.
Jovanovic told FT that the bank has $100bn left to deploy of the $135bn autho­rised by Congress. He said the bank’s early deals would also include a credit insurance guarantee for $4bn of natural gas being delivered to Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners.
The Exim Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

The ongoing tug-of-war over who gets control of the Constitution Ave­nue premises is increasingly starting to resemble a joint family squeezed into an old ancestral home, where every member complains about inadequate space and competing needs.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded that the FCC be moved out of its temporary location within the IHC building, asserting that the new court must eventually operate from the FSC premises.
The bar leadership also warned that any attempt to relocate the IHC itself would be met with determined legal and democratic resistance.

Islamabad judiciary wary as newly formed Federal Constitutional Court could potentially usurp its coveted Constitution Avenue location

The establishment of the FCC has exposed what many observers describe as a lack of planning on the part of policymakers. The FCC — initially part of the 26th Constitutional Amendment package, but removed shortly before its passage — was reintroduced in the 27th Amendment.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building for the FCC days before the amendment was tabled in parliament.
However, the decision to convert the FSC building into the FCC’s permanent home was taken unilaterally, without consulting Shariat Court judges. Under the plan, four FSC judges and a backlog of only 56 pending petitions were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was instructed to urgently prepare four new courtrooms.
 
 

Simultaneously, the CDA was tasked with renovating FSC courtrooms for FCC judges. But when CDA teams arrived to take possession of the Shariat Court premises, the administration strongly resisted, even preventing their entry.
FSC Chief Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rehman, along with other judges, subsequently met Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and conveyed their reservations over what they termed a unilateral and abrupt order, requiring them to vacate their purpose-built premises within a week.
A senior lawyer remarked that the situation was ironic: “A tenant is normally granted at least a month to vacate a rented property, yet the FSC judges were expected to leave within a week from a building acquired specifically for the Shariat Court”.
Cramped space
After the 27th Amendment was passed and received presidential assent, the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC Chief Justice was held at the Presidency, attended by the top civil, military and legal leadership.
But with the FSC building still not handed over to the FCC, the oath-taking for the judges had to be held at the Islamabad High Court.
The initial oath ceremony for three judges took place on November 14 at an open space at the IHC, where IHCBA office-bearers and senior lawyers warmly greeted the newly-appointed judges.
The following day, Justice K.K. Agha was administered the oath in a cramped conference room, which could accommodate barely 25-30 people. On November 17, the oaths of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah were also conducted in the same congested room.
The IHC administration arranged seven courtrooms to enable the FCC to function temporarily until its permanent premises were finalised. But once senior staff of the FCC — many of them brought in from the Supreme Court — assumed their roles, the shortage of space became even more pronounced.
The allocation of courtrooms also caused unease. The FCC chief justice was assigned Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani for his own judicial work.
Senior officials within the high court expressed the apprehension that since the FCC is the highest constitutional forum, its chief justice could potentially assume control of the IHC building if he so desired.
Bar divided
At Friday’s press conference, IHCBA President Wajid Ali Gilani emphasised that the FCC’s use of IHC premises must remain temporary.
“The FCC must first be moved to the Supreme Court building, and permanently to the FSC, where the caseload is lower and infrastructure already exists,” he said. “No institution will be allowed to impose itself on the site of the high court.”
“Any administrative decision taken without consultation with the legal community is unacceptable and will be vigorously resisted,” he warned.
Mr Gilani recalled that Islamabad’s judicial framework had evolved from a single court functioning in Melody Market in 1960, to a full-fledged system with more than a hundred judges.
He said buildings constructed through public funds must operate according to constitutional norms rather than administrative convenience.
IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said rumours of the IHC’s relocation stemmed from a private TV report with “no legal or administrative standing”. He warned: “If anyone tries to wall off the High Court, there will be a strong protest. This community will not allow the judiciary’s independence to be compromised.” In stark contrast to the high court bar’s position, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) — commonly known as the District Bar — welcomed the proposal to shift the high court back to its old premises in Sector G-10.
After a cabinet meeting on Friday, IBA President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar said the proposal would alleviate difficulties faced by lawyers and litigants. “Shifting the high court back to G-10 is a practical and long-awaited step. It will facilitate the legal community and improve access to justice,” he said.

In a final that swung wildly in the space of 40 minutes, Pakistan were bowled out for 125 after yet another top-order meltdown, only for their spinners to rip through Bangladesh ‘A’ and leave them reeling at 53 for 7.
A gritty 43-run eighth-wicket stand between Rakibul Hasan and SM Meherob threatened the unthinkable, before three huge sixes in the 19th over from Abdul Gaffar Saqlain took the game to a Super Over.
Ahmed Daniyal lean-bowled both batters in the first four balls of the Super Over to restrict Bangladesh to just six.
Ripon Mondol, Bangladesh’s hero with the ball in the main game, started superbly with two yorkers but Saad Masood’s flicked four off the third legitimate delivery sealed a famous victory for Pakistan Shaheens.
Earlier, Shaheens’ batting woes resurfaced on a tricky two-paced surface. They lost Yasir Khan to a run-out off the very first ball when Gaffar’s brilliant direct hit caught the opener short.
Two balls later, Mohammad Faiq was castled by left-arm spinner Meherob and when Ghazi Ghori played down the wrong line to Rakibul, Pakistan were 25 for 3 in the powerplay.
Maaz Sadaqat counter-attacked briefly with a 23-ball 23, but once he chopped on against part-time off-spinner Jishan Alam, the innings fell away.
Only Arafat Minhas (25) and a fighting 38 from 26 balls by Saad — the only batter to strike at above 100 after the powerplay — offered resistance.
Bangladesh’s spinners strangled the middle overs, Rakibul finishing with 2-16 and Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby a miserly 0-17 from his four.
Mondol then blew away the lower order with a devastating 19th over that yielded three wickets for just two runs, including two pinpoint yorkers.
Chasing 126, Bangladesh looked well set at 36 for 1 after four overs, Habibur Rahman Sohan having launched Ubaid Shah for a huge six. But the introduction of spin turned the game on its head.
Arafat Minhas struck with his third ball, trapping Jishan lbw, and in his next over removed Mahidul Islam Ankon in identical fashion.
Saad then produced a rank long-hop that Sohan spooned to midwicket, and when Sufiyan Muqeem skidded one through Akbar Ali’s gate, Bangladesh had lost four wickets for eight runs.
Sufiyan, the outstanding bowler of the tournament, was unplayable at times, finishing with 3-11 from four overs including two googlies that crashed into the stumps.
At 53 for 7, Pakistan appeared home and dry, only for Rakibul (24) and Meherob (19) to add 37 crucial runs and keep Bangladesh hopes flickering.
The drama peaked in the final two overs; Shahid Aziz was hammered for three sixes in the 19th as Saqlain took 20 runs off it.
Needing seven off the last over, Daniyal kept his nerve, conceding just three runs and two byes off the first five balls before a leg-bye off the final delivery forced the tie.</p><small>2025-11-23 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23230114eea3292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956894/fo-denounces-indian-defence-ministers-delusional-dangerously-revisionist-remarks-about-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>FO denounces Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional, dangerously revisionist’ remarks about Sindh</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) issued a strong condemnation on Sunday, denouncing Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s “delusional and dangerously revisionist remarks” about Sindh.
The FO’s rebuke came after the Indian media quoted Singh as saying: “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”
According to Indian media outlets, Singh maintained while speaking at an event in Delhi that Sindhi Hindus from his generation never fully accepted the accession of the province to Pakistan.
Sindh has occasionally featured in Indian rhetoric on Pakistan, most often during heightened tensions or significant developments inside India.
Singh’s remarks at Sindhi Samaj Sammelan, an event of the Sindhi community, could have possibly been made to bolster political support by invoking historical and cultural claims.
The FO said in its response to the remarks that such statements revealed an “expansionist Hindutva mindset that seeks to challenge established realities and stands in clear violation of international law, the inviolability of recognised borders, and the sovereignty of states”.
“We urge Mr Rajnath Singh and other Indian leaders to refrain from provocative rhetoric that threatens regional peace and stability. It would be far more constructive for the Government of India to focus on ensuring the security of its own citizens, particularly vulnerable minority communities.
“It should hold accountable those who incite or perpetrate violence against them and address discrimination rooted in faith-based prejudice and historical distortions,” the FO statement read.
It added that India would also “do well to address the persistent grievances of the peoples in its northeast, many of whom continue to face systematic marginalisation, identity-based persecution, and cycles of state-enabled violence”.
“We call on India to take credible steps toward the genuine resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people under occupation.
“Pakistan remains committed to [a] peaceful resolution of all disputes with India on the basis of justice, equity and established international legal norms. At the same time, as in the past, Pakistan is firmly resolved to safeguard its security, national independence and sovereignty,” the FO statement said.
Ties between Pakistan and India have worsened since a four-day military conflict between the two neighbours in May.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Since then, military and political leaders on both sides have issued strongly worded statements and warnings.
In early October, the Pakistani military had warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Islamabad would respond “resolutely, without any qualms or restraints”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had come in the wake of provocative remarks by the top Indian civil-military leadership.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” it said.
In his remarks, Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must “stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wants to retain its place on the map”.
Meanwhile, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
For his part, Singh said during a speech: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”</p><small>2025-11-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635082-fo-slams-indian-defence-ministers-provocative-delusional-remarks-on-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>FO slams Indian defence minister's 'provocative, delusional' remarks on Sindh</strong></a><br><p>

The strike, the first on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital in months, targeted Hezbollah’s acting chief of staff, Ali Tabtabai, the military claimed in a statement.
There was no immediate confirmation of his killing from Hezbollah, although senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qmati confirmed a central figure from the group had been targeted.
Speaking near the bombed-out building in the Haret Hreik suburb, he said Israel’s strike crossed a “red line”. Qmati said Hezbollah’s leadership would decide on whether and how the group would respond.
Five dead in strike
The United States imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016, identifying him as a key Hezbollah leader and offering a reward of up to $5 million for information on him.
The Israeli military statement claimed Tabtabai “commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked hard to restore them to readiness for war with Israel”.
Lebanon’s health ministry said the strike killed five people and wounded 28 more. It hit a multi-storey building, sending debris crashing into cars on the main road below.
People rushed out of their apartment buildings out of fear of further bombardment, a Reuters reporter said.
Following the strike, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the international community to intervene to halt Israeli attacks.
In a statement, Aoun said Lebanon “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”.
The strike came a week before Pope Leo is set to land in Lebanon on his first foreign trip, with many Lebanese hoping the visit could signal the country was heading towards better days.
The November 2024 ceasefire was meant to end a year of fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, triggered by Hezbollah’s rocket fire on Israeli posts a day after the October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian ally Hamas.
But Israel has kept up near-daily strikes on Lebanon since the truce, targeting what it says are Hezbollah arms depots, fighters and efforts by the group to rebuild. It has ratcheted up those strikes in recent weeks.
“We will not allow Hezbollah, the terror organisation, to recover and rebuild its strength and threaten Israel from anywhere inside of Lebanon,” Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters after the strike.
Asked if Israel had notified the US before carrying out the strike, Bedrosian said Israel makes decisions independently.
Earlier, a senior US official said Israel did not notify the United States in advance about its strike, an Axios reporter said on Sunday in a post on X.
The official said the administration was informed immediately after the strike and a second senior US official said Washington knew for days that Israel was planning to escalate strikes in Lebanon, the post read.
 






Israel already killed much of Hezbollah’s leadership
Israel eliminated much of the group’s leadership during the year-long war, including its then-leader Hassan Nasrallah.
Tel Aviv and Beirut have traded blame over ceasefire violations since 2024. Lebanon says Israel’s continuing strikes and occupation of five southern posts in Lebanese territories are major breaches. Aoun says he is open to negotiations but has not received a positive response from Israeli officials.
Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to regroup in the south, and is pressuring Lebanon to be more aggressive in confiscating all unauthorised arms across the country, including Hezbollah’s.
Hezbollah has not fired on Israel since the ceasefire started and says it is abiding by it.</p><small>2025-11-23 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23214834ba59b00.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956892/5-member-fcc-bench-to-take-up-pti-leader-salman-akram-rajas-election-tribunal-plea-on-tuesday' target='_blank'><strong>5-member FCC bench to take up PTI leader Salman Akram Raja’s election tribunal plea on Tuesday</strong></a><br><p>A larger bench of the newly established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is scheduled to take up on Tuesday a petition filed by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja, who has sought the reversal of a court order on elections tribunals, which were formed to settle disputes of last year’s general elections.
According to a supplementary cause list on the FCC’s website, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan has constituted a five-member bench comprising Justices Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah to hear the petition that was originally filed in the Supreme Court (SC) on July 22, 2024.
However, the review petition has now been fixed before the FCC, which was established under the 27th Amendment, on November 24.
In his petition, Raja requested the SC to revisit its earlier order suspending the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) notification of constituting eight election tribunals in Punjab.
He pleaded before the court that its order on July 4, 2024 had exposed the entire process of adjudication of election disputes in Punjab to the whims and arbitrary desires of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
On July 4, 2024, a five-judge SC bench, headed by then-chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, had also ordered a meaningful consultation between LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja for the formation of the tribunals.
The review petition pleaded that without providing any guidance with respect to the meaning and scope of the term “consultation” as used in Section 140(3) of the Elections Act, 2017, the LHC chief justice was directed by the SC to engage in consultation with the ECP.
The scope of the word “consultation” had been elaborately defined by the SC in the 1996 Al-Jehad Trust case and the same interpretation had been consistently followed in all matters pertaining to judicial appointments, it argued.
The petition contended that the view of the high court CJ with respect to the suitability of a particular person’s appoi­nt­m­ent as judge of any court should be granted the highest regard and consideration.
It said the LHC judgement had correctly held that the names of judges of the high court provided by the chief justice through a letter on April 4, 2024 may not be departed by the ECP as a matter of right or arbitrary discretion.
The view adopted by the ECP that it was entitled to disregard any name provided by the LHC chief justice without assigning any reasons had been held to be without any lawful basis, the review petition said.
Raja argued that during the hearing before the Supreme Court, two of the members on the bench were very clear in their rejection of the ECP’s claim that it was entitled to receive panels of names from the LHC chief justice for it to choose judges for appointment to the election tribunals in its discretion.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had clearly asked the ECP counsel to identify the basis in the text of the Elections Act or anywhere else in the law or in the Constitution for the contention that the ECP was to be provided panels of judges for each election tribunal to be appointed so that the commission could choose one of the judges for appointment.
“No answer to this query could be provided by the counsel for ECP,” the petition said, adding that in the law, there was no basis for the ECP demanding a panel of judges for each election tribunal so that it might reject some or all contained in the panel provided by the high court chief justice.

The win sealed for Pakistan a spot in the November 29 final.
Chasing a formidable 196, Zimbabwe were skittled for a paltry 126 in 19 overs, collapsing from 60 for 4 to 60 for 7 in the space of just five deliveries during a mesmerising 10th over from the 25-year-old Usman.
The Rawalpindi crowd erupted as the unorthodox spinner became only the fourth Pakistani to take a T20I hat-trick.
Zimbabwe never recovered from the early blows delivered by Pakistan’s pace battery.
Naseem Shah struck with his sixth ball when Tadiwanashe Marumani (four) chipped tamely to cover point, and Mohammad Wasim Jr clean-bowled the dangerous Brian Bennett (nine) with a sharp inswinger to reduce the visitors to 14 for 2.
Brendan Taylor looked scratchy and fell for eight, spooning a simple catch to Babar Azam at cover off Faheem Ashraf.
Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe’s captain and biggest hope, counter-attacked with 23 off 18 balls, launching Faheem for a huge six over deep midwicket. But once he picked out the same fielder off Mohammad Nawaz in the eighth over, the innings fell apart spectacularly.
Ryan Burl waged a lone battle, stroking an elegant unbeaten 67 from 49 balls (eight fours, two sixes) with exquisite timing and placement.
His fifty came off 32 deliveries and featured a 101-metre slog-sweep off Nawaz — the biggest six of the night — but he received no support whatsoever.
The defining moment arrived in the 10th over. Tony Munyonga top-edged a sweep to short fine leg, Tashinga Musekiwa played too early and was bowled off his pads, and Wellington Masakadza skied a slog-sweep straight to long-on to complete Usman’s hat-trick.
Usman returned later to castle Tinotenda Maposa and finish with career-best figures.
Burl continued to fight, adding 44 runs for the last wicket with Richard Ngarava (five), who was eventually run out off the final ball. But the result had long been sealed.
Earlier, a sensational late assault from Fakhar Zaman, who blazed an unbeaten 27 off just 10 balls with three sixes and a four, lifted Pakistan to a formidable 195 for 5.
Coming in at number seven, Fakhar turned the final two overs into a personal highlight reel.
He smoked Brad Evans for 25 runs in the last over, including two towering sixes and a deftly placed four, while also benefiting from a crucial no-ball that reprieved him on the final delivery.
In all, Pakistan plundered 69 runs from the last five overs after a more measured start.
Earlier, Babar Azam and Sahibzada Farhan had laid a solid platform with a classy 103-run second-wicket partnership.
Sahibzada, continuing his rich vein of form, struck a brisk 63 off 41 balls (four fours and three sixes) before falling in the 16th over to Raza’s skiddy arm-ball.
Babar, who had looked scratchy in the powerplay, grew into his innings beautifully, reaching 74 off 52 deliveries (seven fours and two sixes) before holing out to deep midwicket off Raza in the 18th over.
Pakistan’s innings began cautiously after they were asked to bat first. Saim Ayub threatened fireworks with two early sixes but perished for 13, pulling Evans to deep square leg.
Farhan and Babar then rebuilt steadily; the former racing to a 32-ball fifty with elegant drives and pulls, while Babar, after a slow start, found his timing in the second half of the innings, bringing up his fifty in 43 balls before accelerating.
A middle-order wobble — Faheem run out for three, Babar and Mohammad Nawaz falling in quick succession — briefly pegged Pakistan back to 167 for 5 with less than two overs remaining.
But Fakhar’s pyrotechnics ensured the hosts posted what appears a challenging total on a surface that offered occasional low bounce and grip for the spinners.</p><small>2025-11-23 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231933500ebe63c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956888/lifetime-immunity-for-public-office-holders-has-concentrated-unchecked-power-in-hands-of-a-few-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Lifetime immunity for public office holders has concentrated ‘unchecked power in hands of a few’: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>In a statement issued on Sunday after its 39th annual general meeting, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern over the 27th Constitutional Amendment, noting that lifetime immunity for public 0ffice holders had “concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few”.
The contentious tweak was passed by Parliament on November 13 after days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, and received the president’s assent the same day.
 
 

The amendment made significant changes to the judicial system and the military’s chain of command, and granted sweeping immunities to government officials. Under the Amendment, lifetime immunity from arrest and all criminal and civil proceedings has been granted to the president and anyone holding the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet and Marshal of the Air Force.
Referring to the Amendment, the HRCP drew attention to “escalating threats to constitutional democracy, civic freedoms, and the safety of vulnerable communities across the country”.
The HRCP said it “is deeply concerned over the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which undermines judicial independence by expanding executive control over matters that should remain free from executive interference”.
“The amendment further weakens essential checks and balances at a time when public trust in state institutions is fragile. Lifetime immunity for holders of public office has concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few, eroding parliamentary supremacy,” the commission’s statement read.
The human rights body also stressed that empowered and elected local governments were critical for deepening democracy and strengthening citizens’ participation in governance.
It underlined that efforts to curb militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan “must protect fundamental freedoms and the right to dissent”.
“Blanket internet shutdowns in Balochistan and other parts of the country have disrupted education, livelihoods, and democratic participation and must end immediately.
 
 

“[The] HRCP urges the federal and provincial governments to implement rights-respecting security measures, conduct impartial investigations into abuses by state actors, and engage meaningfully with local communities. This includes ending enforced disappearances and the use of interment centres without due process.”
“The use of the Fourth Schedule to muzzle dissent must cease,” the statement said.
 
 

The Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 (ATA) is a list of individuals placed under observation by the government on suspicion of their involvement in terrorism or sectarianism.
The statement added that the HRCP “notes with alarm the ongoing harassment, detention, and forced repatriation of Afghan refugees, many facing credible threats of persecution, family separation, and severe humanitarian distress”.
“The government must suspend deportations, ensure due process, and uphold international protection standards. Pakistan should ratify the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol and protect the right to citizenship by birth and naturalisation,” the HRCP emphasised.
It further stated that custodial torture and extrajudicial killings, “particularly involving Crime Control Department and Counter-Terrorism Department personnel”, demanded urgent independent inquiries and accountability.
“Such violations perpetuate impunity and threaten citizens’ right to life and dignity.”
Moreover, the HRCP noted that religious minorities, especially Ahmadis, continued to face mob violence, attacks on their sites or worship and desecration of graves.
 
 

The state must ensure protection, prosecute incitement, and implement the delayed commission to investigate misuse of the blasphemy law, as well as legislate against forced conversions, the HRCP statement added.
It further said that child marriage remained pervasive in the country, endangering girls’ health, education, and futures.
“[The] HRCP calls for legislative reforms to define a minor consistently across laws and declare all marriages under 18 illegal.
“Sexual harassment in educational, public and private institutions also persists; robust reporting, transparent accountability, and preventive training are essential to safeguard learning environments and workplaces.”
The HRCP also urged the government to protect climate-displaced persons, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, with safe shelter, essential services and sustainable resettlement solutions.
The authorities must also ensure long-term support for rebuilding homes and livelihoods for those affected by the recent floods, particularly in South Punjab, the HRCP said.
Lastly, the human rights body stressed that incarcerated Indian and Pakistani fisherfolk must be repatriated to their respective countries and receive humane treatment, legal representation and protection from arbitrary detention to preserve their rights and livelihoods.</p><small>2025-11-23 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635035-pml-ns-sanaullah-invites-pti-to-dialogue-after-cm-afridi-signals-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N's Sanaullah invites PTI to dialogue after CM Afridi signals cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to the media in Faisalabad, Sanaullah said, “We are still in favour of politicians sitting together at a table to resolve issues.”
He recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “unconditional offer“ he made in August to all political parties to become a part of the ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’ (Charter for Stability of Pakistan).
Sanaullah was speaking to reporters as by-elections were underway today in PP-116, where his son-in-law Ahmed Shaharyar is contesting as the PML-N candidate.
 
 

On the PTI’s official boycott of most of the by-elections held today, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Sanaullah, also the PM’s political aide, assailed Imran for “always creating a deadlock”, while “democracy progresses through dialogue”.
“A person is sitting in jail, and from there he wants to spread chaos, anarchy and fitna (evil) in the country, and there are also examples of May 9 and Nov 26 present,” he said, referring to Imran and the PTI’s protests.
Weeks of negotiations between the government and the PTI in December last year failed to achieve any tangible results on major issues back then, as both parties accused each other of derailing the negotiations.
Late last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there were no negotiations or talks ongoing between the party and the federal government or the military establishment.
‘PML-N only party deserving of votes’
Speaking about the by-election, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency regarding the polling process, dismissing allegations of rigging and disturbances in different constituencies.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” Shaharyar’s father-in-law said, adding that PML-N was the only deserving party for that.
On the low voter turnout, the senior politician contended that while general elections usually recorded a turnout of 50 to 60 per cent, by-polls only witnessed a 25 to 30pc turnout on average.
Sanaullah added: “There should be no such incident as Oct 12, 1999 or 2017/2018 when a conspiracy was done against Pakistan and a project was launched, which injected the culture of hatred [… and] enmity into politics.”
 


The senator said, “I contested seven elections in my constituency, out of which I won five. So my performance is in front of everyone. And as far as rigging is concerned, the voting process is being carried is in front of you, and the counting will take place in front of you.
“But despite that, if someone wants to cry foul,  and if someone has started crying foul since yesterday and today morning about rigging, then we have no solution for that,” he added.
“The era of development has returned in the name of Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Sanaullah said, referring to the Punjab chief minister’s election last year.
The PML-N leader also highlighted that the party halted certain development projects in Faisalabad in line with the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) campaigning rules.
“There were projects worth Rs70 billion to be started in Faisalabad, including a metro project and a scheme to supply fresh water to the entire city. But we requested to halt it for the time being and proceed after the election so that people cannot say we only did that for the sake of elections.”</p><small>2025-11-23 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635011-karachi-faced-884m-gallon-water-shortfall-in-nov-due-to-power-outages-kwsb' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi faced 884m gallon water shortfall in Nov due to power outages: KWSC</strong></a><br><p>
