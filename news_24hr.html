The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press.
Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down.
 
 

Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects.

Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed

Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded.
Two killed in Swabi
Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred.
According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers.
“The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.
Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police.
Attack repelled
Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building.
“But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee.
The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack.
 
 

Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

A long-term ceasefire was reached in Doha early on Sunday, where both sides pledged to continue the diplomatic process and find a permanent solution to the prevailing problem — cross-border incursions by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups. Qatar and Turkiye have played a key role in bringing about the truce, and representatives of both Islamabad and Kabul will meet in Istanbul on Saturday to take the process forward.
Though the Pakistani state and the Afghan Taliban once maintained cordial relations, matters have nosedived during the hard-line group’s second innings. At the heart of the matter is the sanctuary provided by the Afghan Taliban to the banned TTP and other militant groups that have staged bloody attacks in Pakistan. Though the Taliban deny this, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that terrorist groups indeed have havens in Afghanistan.
 
 

Over the last few months, the attacks have increased significantly — over 600 attacks over the past year, according to one report — causing heavy casualties amongst Pakistani security men. It is because earlier attempts at dialogue failed to stop such attacks that the state took action, hitting militant targets across the border.
But while this may have sent a strong message to Kabul, if the hostilities continue, it will bode ill for peace in South Asia, as Pakistan will have to face adversaries on two hostile borders. Therefore, the state may have to combine deterrence through military means — in case of further attacks — with sustained diplomacy through common friends and regional allies to arrive at a long-term solution.
 
 

After the Doha parleys, the Taliban spokesman said there would be no “hostile actions” against Pakistan. While such promises have been made during earlier diplomatic encounters as well, for example earlier this year under Chinese auspices, it is hoped this time the Kabul regime is serious about stopping cross-border militant activity.
As Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted, a “verifiable monitoring mechanism” is needed to implement the broad details agreed to in Doha, which should be the goal during the next meeting in Turkiye. Though the Taliban may remain in denial, the international community agrees that they continue to host terrorist groups. Therefore, as the de facto government in Afghanistan, it is their duty to prevent these outfits from harming neighbouring states.
While some militant groups — the TTP, Al Qaeda — may respond to the Taliban ‘requests’, others, such as IS-K, are unlikely to oblige. However, it is the Taliban’s job as the governing entity in Afghanistan to ensure the security of regional states is not harmed by groups based on its soil.

As they met at the White House for their first summit, Trump said the deal had been negotiated over four or five months. Albanese described it as an $8.5 billion pipeline “that we have ready to go.” The full terms of the agreement were not immediately available. The two leaders said part of the agreement had to do with processing of the minerals. Albanese said both countries will contribute $1 billion over the next six months for joint projects.
 






The United States has been looking for access to rare earths and critical minerals around the world as China tightens control over global supply. China has the world’s largest rare earths reserves, according to US Geological Survey data, but Australia also has significant reserves.
The two leaders also planned to discuss the $239.46 billion AUKUS agreement, reached in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden, in which Australia is to buy US nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 before building a new submarine class with Britain.
Navy Secretary John Phelan told the meeting the United States and Australia were working very closely to improve the original AUKUS framework for all three parties “and clarify some of the ambiguity that was in the prior agreement.” Trump said these were “just minor details.” “There shouldn’t be any more clarifications, because we’re just, we’re just going now full steam ahead, building,” Trump said.
Australian officials have said they are confident AUKUS will proceed, with Defence Minister Richard Marles last week saying he knew when the review would conclude.
Cooperative and warm relationship
Ahead of Monday’s meeting between the two leaders, Australian officials have emphasized Canberra is paying its way under AUKUS, contributing $2 billion this year to boost production rates at US submarine shipyards, and preparing to maintain US Virginia-class submarines at its Indian Ocean naval base from 2027.
The delay of 10 months in an official meeting since Trump took office has caused some anxiety in Australia as the Pentagon urged Canberra to lift defence spending. The two leaders met briefly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.
Australia is willing to sell shares in its planned strategic reserve of critical minerals to allies including Britain, Reuters reported last month, as Western governments scramble to end their reliance on China for rare earths and minor metals. Top US officials last week condemned Beijing’s expansion of rare earth export controls as a threat to global supply chains. China is the world’s biggest producer of the materials that are vital materials for products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.
Resource-rich Australia, wanting to extract and process rare earths, put preferential access to its strategic reserve on the table in US trade negotiations in April.
Ties with China
The United States has a large trade surplus with Australia, which is among the countries with the lowest US tariff. Australia’s biggest trade partner is China, with exports of iron ore and coal long underpinning its national budget, despite efforts by Albanese’s government to diversify export markets after Beijing’s $20 billion boycott of Australian agriculture and coal from 2020 to 2023.

The widespread outage of Amazon’s cloud services unit took down many popular internet services, impacting streaming platforms, messaging services such as Reddit and Snapchat, and some banks and businesses.
Also affected were Amazon’s Shopping, Prime Video service and Disney+, as well as Perplexity AI, the Fortnite game, Airbnb, Duolingo, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and trading app Robinhood.
Mobile telephone services and messaging apps Signal and Whatsapp were also affected in Europe, according to Downdetector, a website monitoring internet problems. Some UK banks, such as Lloyd’s were also impacted, and pointed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the problem.
After few hours of disruptions, systems were gradually coming back online, with AWS saying it was seeing “significant signs of recovery” for some impacted services. AWS’s maintenance site said its engineers scrambled to fix the underlying DNS issue once they became aware of “increased error rates” hitting multiple services. More than four hours later, though some problems persisted, AWS said it was on the path “towards full recovery” and most of its operations were “succeeding normally”.
The DNS issue identified has to do with the Domain Name System protocol used on the internet to associate information with various domain names.
Although the DNS problem was “fully mitigated”, it caused a huge backlog of stymied requests that had to be worked through, AWS said.
‘Cable fault’
Meanwhile, internet users in Pakistan complained of service degradation and slow browsing speeds on certain ISPs, which was once again attributed to a fault in the submarine cable.
There was no statement or acknowledgement from the ISPs in question, the IT ministry, or the regulator, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority.
When approached for comment, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja attributed it to the global shutdown of Amazon cloud services. “Snapchat and other major apps [are] down due to Amazon web service outage worldwide,” she told Dawn.
However, many internet users claimed they had been informed by their ISP that services were suffering due to cable damage. Taking to X, digital expert Habibullah Khan claimed that the disruption was due to a fault in the PEACE cable.
“It’s a cable cut on the core system. They are running tests to localise the fault location,” he posted.
 






The PEACE cable system originates in China and connects to Pakistan via the Misri Shah gateway in Karachi’s DHA, providing 600 gigabytes per second (Gbps) to Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), other cables landing in the country are operated by the state-owned PTCL and the TransWorld Associates.
Three undersea cable networks operated by the PTCL are AAE-1 (Africa, Asia and Europe), SMW4 (South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) and the IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe).
The SMW-4 and IMEWE have landing stations at Hawkesbay, while the AAE-1 lands at Clifton, Karachi.

• Stakeholders say malpractice has pushed textile mills towards costly imports, deepening financial woes
• Investigators allege armed men assault PCGA team 
LAHORE: A startling case of large-scale cotton adulteration has surfaced in Sindh, where a ginning factory in Tando Adam was allegedly found mixing cotton waste into high-grade lint to produce what industry insiders are calling “burger cotton.”
According to reports, a four-member monitoring team of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) — formed to curb such malpractice — raided the factory after receiving credible complaints. However, the operation turned violent when the factory owner allegedly summoned nearly a hundred armed men who assaulted and detained the visiting committee members for several hours on Sunday.
The incident has sent shockwaves through the cotton ginning industry nationwide. In protest, an emergency meeting of the PCGA’s monitoring committee and Sindh-based ginners was convened in Tando Adam, where participants resolved to register an FIR against the factory management after the Diwali holidays.
Some ginners in collusion with textile mill representatives and laboratory staff, had been blending cotton waste into lint bales — a practice that has steadily eroded the quality of Pakistani cotton – for several years. This malpractice has discouraged textile mills from purchasing domestic cotton, pushing them instead towards costly foreign imports and deepening the industry’s financial crisis.
Ahead of the cotton year 2025-26, the PCGA had decided to expose such “black sheep” in the sector. Separate monitoring committees were set up for Punjab and Sindh with the authority to inspect ginning factories and take disciplinary action against violators.
The Sindh monitoring committee, led by well-known ginner Ramesh Lal, had already inspected several units since May. While a few factories were earlier found involved in adulteration and warned, no fresh complaints had surfaced until recently. Following renewed reports from textile buyers, a four-member team — comprising Haji Liaquat Ali Laskani, Seth Gopal Das, Seth Kishan Chand, and Seth Jay Dada — conducted a surprise raid on the Tando Adam factory.
According to the investigators, they discovered that three ginning units were operating within a single compound, where workers were pressing bales in a sophisticated manner — filling the outer layers with premium lint while packing the inner cores with cheap cotton waste. This ensured that laboratory samples taken from the surface appeared to meet quality standards.
As the committee members attempted to enter the facility, they reportedly faced stiff resistance. The factory owner called in over a hundred armed men, who beat and threatened the PCGA team at gunpoint before releasing them after considerable delay. Sources said heaps of cotton waste were seen openly being mixed into lint during the raid.
Ihsanul Haq, a representatives of the ginning industry said such adulterated lint, nicknamed “burger cotton” in Sindh, was being produced and sold at high prices with the alleged connivance of ginning owners, textile mill procurement agents, and lab staff — allowing all parties to profit while damaging the reputation of Pakistani cotton exports.
In the wake of the attack on the PCGA team, the PCGA monitoring committee and Sindh ginners held an emergency session in Tando Adam on Sunday evening, chaired by senior members of the association, to review the situation and finalise legal and disciplinary measures against those involved.
The meeting decided that All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) officials and major textile groups would be immediately informed about the reported mixing of cotton waste in the said ginning factory. Another meeting of cotton ginners was scheduled for Thursday, after the Diwali holidays, to formulate a strategy for strict disciplinary action against the concerned cotton ginner and to seek a ban on factories mixing cotton waste with quality lint.
The meeting further resolved to urge textile mill owners to dismiss those selectors and laboratory staff who, in collusion with ginning factory owners, blend cotton waste into quality lint. Participants stressed that producing high-quality cotton domestically would help significantly boost the country’s exports.
The association has also demanded immediate government protection for its inspection teams and a nationwide crackdown on adulterated lint production to safeguard the integrity of Pakistan’s cotton industry — a sector already struggling to maintain competitiveness in the international textile market.

The proposed name of the alliance makes the matter to be taken up for hearing by the ECP today (Tuesday) all the more interesting as they want the alliance to be registered as Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai.
The  applicants include Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai,  Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare  Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.
The TTAP, which sees the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement, has formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP.

ECP set to review proposed name that matches nomenclature already in use by Achakzai-led opposition alliance

Those  who will appear before the ECP on behalf of the alliance and its  components include Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and retired Justice Shahid  Malik.
A source in the TTAP said the alliance had been formed to  resist unconstitutional and undemocratic moves and strive for the supremacy of the Constitution. He said alliances had been formed in the past which were not registered with the ECP but carried forward their respective movements. That is why the alliance had not been registered, he added.
 
 

Veteran politician Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.
The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.

• Anti-smog guns, sprinklers deployed to counter pollution
• Lahore emerges as third-worst polluted city, behind New Delhi and Kolkata
LAHORE: Smog is set to intensify across Lahore and other parts of the province due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, the Punjab government said on Monday.
The provincial capital of Punjab ranked as the third most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
Around 8pm, the air quality index (AQI) reading for Lahore stood at a ‘very unhealthy’ reading of 182, trailing Kolkata (203) and New Delhi with the highest reading of 213.
 
 

In a bid to combat smog, the provincial government had started water sprinkling operations from Sunday night and activated anti-smog guns in the most affected areas.
In Lahore, these measures were deployed across the city, including Karim Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Multan Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara Flyover, GT Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, and Upper Mall.
Besides local pollutants, winds blowing from India are also likely to play a role in worsening the situation over the week.
The Environment Protection Department said winds blowing from New Delhi and other parts of India at a speed of 4-7km/h are moving toward Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan.
Similarly, the southern districts of Multan, Bahawalpur, and Bahawalnagar will also be affected due to pollutants from across the border in the wake of Diwali festivities that feature fireworks.
The Punjab Smog Monitoring Centre reported that Lahore’s AQI is expected to remain between 210 and 230 on Tuesday (today), with high levels of pollution during early morning and night hours. However, slight improvement is expected between 1pm and 5pm. Due to low wind speeds (1-8km/h) and a lack of rainfall, harmful particles are likely to remain suspended in the air.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and other officials urged citizens to play their role, stating that “every citizen’s role in preventing and reducing smog brings about significant change and success”.
Ms Aurangzeb directed the authorities to take precautionary measures, such as masks for motorcycle riders and covering construction sites and material transport vehicles. She also suggested keeping doors and windows shut.
83 detained
Meanwhile, the Lahore police said it arrested 83 persons and registered 77 cases as part of its ongoing anti-smog operation. According to the Lahore police spokesperson, the arrests targeted a range of pollution sources, adding that 68 people were detained for smoke emissions from factories, kilns, and vehicles, nine for burning tyres, plastic, and shopping bags, and six for burning crop residue.
The crackdown was spread across the city, with the highest number of arrests (42) made in the Saddar Division, followed by the City Zone (14), and Cantt (13). Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana said the Punjab Safe Cities Authority’s camera network was being used to trace environmental polluters.
Toxic haze in Delhi
Meanwhile, across the border, New Delhi remained shrouded in a thick, toxic haze on Monday as air pollution levels soared to more than 16 times the World Health Organisation’s recommended daily maximum, reported AFP. New Delhi and its sprawling metropolitan region — home to more than 30 million people — are regularly ranked among the world’s most polluted capitals, with acrid smog blanketing the skyline each winter.
The Indian Supreme Court relaxed this month a blanket ban on fireworks over Diwali to allow the use of the less-polluting “green firecrackers” — designed to emit fewer particulates.
The ban was widely ignored in past years.
On Monday, levels of PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — hit 248 micrograms per cubic metre in parts of the city, according to monitoring organisation IQAir.
The government’s Commission of Air Quality Management said air quality is expected to further deteriorate in the coming days.
It also implemented a set of measures to curb pollution levels, including asking authorities to ensure uninterrupted power supply to reduce the use of diesel generators.
City authorities have also said they will trial cloud seeding by aeroplanes for the first time over Delhi this month, the practice of firing salt or other chemicals into clouds to induce rain to clear the air.

The national side’s pace spearhead will lead Pakistan in the upcoming three-match series against South Africa.
 






Shaheen replaces Mohammad Rizwan as the Pakistan ODI skipper after the wicket-keeper led the team during a disastrous ICC Champions Trophy campaign before series losses in New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan, handed captaincy in 2024, had led the team to series wins in South Africa, Australia and Zimbabwe in his early days as captain, however. But the recent failures apparently were a decisive enough factor for the Pakistan Cricket Board to sack Rizwan.
For Shaheen, it’s going to be a second stint as the Pakistan captain, the left-armer having been snubbed after a short spell — five T20Is against New Zealand — at the helm after replacing Babar Azam in late 2023 following Pakistan’s dismal World Cup campaign.
The 25-year-old, who has been captaining Pakistan Super League side Lahore Qalandars for the last few years, seems to be Pakistan white-ball head coach Mike Hesson’s pick as the team’s leader going into the build-up for the 2027 World Cup.
 
 

“Shaheen’s appointment for the upcoming series was finalised today following a meeting held in Islamabad, which was attended by white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Director High Performance Aqib Javed and members of the selection committee,” a short press release by the PCB said.
Shaheen has represented Pakistan in 66 ODIs and 92 T20Is, taking a combined 249 wickets. In 32 Tests, excluding the ongoing second Test against South Africa at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Shaheen has claimed 120 wickets.
The PCB regime, led by Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024, has chopped and changed captains repeatedly. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of the white-ball team.</p><small>2025-10-20 19:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629633-defence-minister-dismisses-ttp-talks-says-only-engaged-with-afghan-taliban' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister rules out TTP talks, says Pakistan only engaging Afghan Taliban</strong></a><br><p>

Indian wire agency ANI reported that his last rites were performed at Santacruz Crematorium in the presence of his family.
His manager, Babu Bhai Thiba, told the outlet that Asrani died at 3pm at Arogya Nidhi Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra. “He is survived by his wife, sister, and nephew,” the manager added.
The outlet added that over his long and successful career, Asrani became one of Hindi cinema’s “most loved faces” who became known for his “perfect comic timing and screen presence”, adding that he appeared in over 350 films across five decades.
It added that he began his career in the 1960s and reached his peak in the 1970s, “when he became one of the most dependable character actors of the time”.
The media outlet further said that among his “most memorable roles” were in Mere Apne, Koshish, Bawarchi, Parichay, Abhimaan, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat and Rafoo Chakkar while among his hit films were Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Dhamaal, Bunty Aur Babli 2, R… Rajkumar, All The Best and Welcome, among others.
“However, one of his most iconic performances remains his role as the eccentric jail warden in the 1975 classic Sholay, which became a part of Indian pop culture and is still remembered today,” the report added.
The Indian Express reported that he was born in Jaipur on January 1, 1941. It added that while reflecting on the “enduring appeal” of his Sholay character, Asrani told the BBC earlier this year, “As Sholay completes 50 years, I can tell you — there has not been a single function or event where I haven’t been asked to recite those dialogues. It’s all because of Sippy saab’s direction and the writing of Salim-Javed. I got a chance to learn how to truly prepare for a role, and what a lesson it was.

The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan.
“Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.”
 
 

The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said.
“We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.”
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said.
Kabul has previously denied such accusations.
In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic, he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”.
Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years.
He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats.
Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord.
The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement.
Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries.
He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed.
The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise.
As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again.
Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added.
The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said.
In a separate interview to Arab News, he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.”
He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades.
“We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country.
“Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.”
Doha talks and press release controversy
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it.
“Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials.
“Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.”
Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects.
Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.”
The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions.
He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25.
The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion.
Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents.
“It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.</p><small>2025-10-20 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201114291fea1c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950135/positive-step-saudi-arabia-china-welcome-pakistan-afghanistan-ceasefire-affirm-support-for-peace-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>‘Positive step’: Saudi Arabia, China welcome Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire, affirm support for peace efforts</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia joined other nations on Monday in welcoming the ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan after days of border hostilities, affirming its support for efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability between the two countries.
 
 

The ceasefire was agreed early yesterday morning during talks between Afghan and Pakistani delegations in Doha with the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye. A next round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled to be held in Istanbul on October 25.
A statement posted on the Saudi foreign ministry’s X account said it “expresses the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s welcome of the signing by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan of an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries, during the round of negotiations held in Doha.”
 






“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security that achieves stability and prosperity for the brotherly peoples of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This kingdom hopes that this positive step will lead to an end to tensions on the border between the two countries,” the statement said.
Saudi Arabia — which signed a defence pact with Pakistan last month under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both —  also appreciated the “diplomatic efforts and constructive role” of Turkiye and Qatar in mediating the ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
Yesterday, Turkiye’s, Oman’s and Qatar’s foreign ministries had also issued statements welcoming the ceasefire.
China, Russia welcome Pak-Afghan ceasefire
Meanwhile, in separate statements issued on Monday, China and Russia welcomed the ceasefire agreement reached between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“China welcomes the immediate ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan and commends the peace effort of countries who contributed to the ceasefire,” the Chinese foreign ministry said.
China vowed to “continue playing a constructive role for the improvement and development of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations”.
 






Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, welcomed the agreement as well, calling on both countries to “expand their cooperation, including in countering terrorism,“ Anadolu Agency reported.
Islamabad and Kabul’s intention to engage in dialogue and resolve their disagreements through diplomatic means “forms the basis for maintaining peace between the two countries, which are friendly to us, and serves as an important factor in ensuring regional security,“ the Turkish news agency quoted her as saying.
Border clashes
The skirmishes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan began on the night of October 11, when Afghan forces launched an attack on Pakistani border posts. According to the media affairs wing of the Pakistani military, its 23 troops were martyred in the clashes that continued into Oct 12 while over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were killed.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Later, clashes again broke out on the night of Oct14 along the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram sector. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said
the Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term state has designated for the banned  terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack Pakistani border posts in the area but the attacks were effectively repulsed.
Subsequently on Oct 15, the ISPR said security forces had repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban.
However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid alleged earlier in the day that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Later in the day, state media reported citing security sources that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghan capital Kabul and the province of Kandahar, targeting terrorists’ hideouts and leadership.
This was a little before a 48-hour ceasefire was announced between the two sides. Dawn reported that it was the second ceasefire between the neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. It quoted diplomatic insiders as saying that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
The ceasefire was extended on October 17.
While delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to meet in Doha for talks to end border hostilities, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Oct 17, according to a Dawn report.
It said incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
This development followed a gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan.
The border clashes had erupted against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, since the TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government and vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20190720320684e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950169/weather-out-of-our-control-but-trying-our-best-to-make-the-semis-says-rameen-ahead-of-south-africa-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Weather out of our control but trying our best to make the semis, says Rameen ahead of South Africa clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan bowler Rameen Shamim said on Monday that although the weather was out of their control, the team was trying their best to make the semi-finals ahead of their pivotal South Africa ICC Women’s World Cup encounter on Tuesday.
Monsoon rains in Colombo have seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push.
The washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament, with the Green Shirts still searching for their first win.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Colombo, Rameen said: “Yeah, obviously, rain is not in our control. We cannot control the weather. Yeah, unfortunately, we are upset because we were up to the mark against England.
“… But we are confident because we played some good cricket in the last two matches. And now we have to play against South Africa and Sri Lanka.”
The off-spinner added that playing a series against South Africa in the lead-up to the World Cup would come in handy going into the Tuesday clash.
“We are really prepared against them because we have played a series against South Africa before this World Cup. So, we know what to do in the next two matches, and our aim is just to win those two matches,” she said.
The Green Shirts played a home series in Lahore in September against the Proteas, where they lost the first two games before beating the visitors in the final ODI on a spin-friendly track.
 
 

They also faced each other in a World Cup practice match in Colombo ahead of the tournament itself, where the Proteas won by four wickets.
Although the conditions at the R. Pramedasa Stadium have been seamer-friendly, the pitch has seen turn later in the innings and with the pitches getting older as the tournament progresses — Pakistan will be looking for a spin-friendly pitch like Lahore from last month.
The Pakistan bowler added that although the circumstances for the semis were not in their control, adding, “We just want to win those upcoming matches and just leave our mark.”
South African pacer Masabata Klaas also alluded to the challenge Pakistan posed going into the encounter.
“Oh, obviously Pakistan is [a] strong team. We cannot just go there and think that we’re just going to walk in the park. But then one thing that’s going to work for us is to stick to basics and do what we’ve been doing from day one of the World Cup,” the right-arm medium pacer said.
She added that her side would not be taking the Green Shirts for granted.
The Proteas go into the clash with a result in a rain-affected encounter in Colombo against Sri Lanka — where they won by 10 wickets in a 20-over contest.
For Pakistan, their skipper Fatima Sana’s form with the ball has been a positive going into this must-win encounter. The right-arm pacer has taken nine wickets at an outstanding average of 16 so far.
The Women in Green will also be looking for the weather to relent in the Sri Lankan capital, which caused their pre-match practice session to be moved indoors yet again — at an alternate venue near the Sinhalese Sports Club.
 






What needs to fire for the Green Shirts is their batting, which again faltered in their stop-start clash against New Zealand — with the scoreline at  92-5 with half their batting innings to go.
A much improved batting performance — and results from the rest of the World Cup matches somehow going in their favour is what the Green Shirts need to sneak past the rains and book a berth in the semi-finals.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629597-no-room-for-hatred-terrorism-affirms-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>'No room for hatred, terrorism', affirms PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting came in the wake of a feud between the PPP and PML-N, coalition partners in the federation, that has seemed to cool down for now. Ties between the allies came under immense strain recently as they engaged in a war of words over flood relief, after Bilawal asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by floods in the country, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Concerted efforts were made by leading figures, such as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari, who stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement.
A statement from the PPP issued today said Bilawal met Naqvi and discussed issues of mutual interest, political affairs and the country’s situation, with the latter informing the PPP chairman on the steps taken to establish peace and security in the country amid a tense situation on both the international and domestic fronts.
 






Expressing his satisfaction with the measures, Bilawal said: “Current challenges can be faced only through unity and consensus,” while Naqvi was similarly quoted by the statement as saying: “Everyone has to work together for the internal stability of Pakistan.”
After weeks of acrimony between the ruling allies, the two main parties in the ruling coalition seemed to make a breakthrough on Thursday, with a PPP leader claiming the prime minister had acceded to one of their main demands.
“The prime minister has agreed to utilise BISP for helping flood victims and that the PPP will be taken on board while decision-making about flood victims and farmers,” PPP Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan had told Dawn.
The understanding, he said, was reached during a meeting at the Prime Minister’s House with a PPP delegation led by Bilawal. All eyes will now be on how the premier convinces the PML-N-led Punjab government. Chan said the PM had agr­eed to all the PPP’s demands “as they were justified and logical”.
Before charting its future course, the PPP has decided to adopt a wait-and-see policy, giving the government one month to act on promises made by PM Shehbaz on its demands.
The development came after an hour-long meeting of its central executive committee on Saturday that covered a wide range of issues, including the PPP’s strained relations with the PML-N, the post-flood situation, recent tensions with Afghanistan and the ongoing economic challenges faced by the country.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20214458812bb74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950180/two-aswj-workers-shot-dead-in-suspected-targeted-attack-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Two ASWJ workers shot dead in ‘suspected targeted attack’ in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>At least two people, both workers of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday.
The attack comes over a week after another worker of the ASWJ was shot dead on the main University Road in Karachi, while in a separate attack in March, a local leader of the party was shot.
“A religious scholar-cum-shopkeeper and his employee were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack at Nagan Chowrangi on Monday evening,” SSP Central Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com.
The incident occurred near an ASWJ office, he said.
“Armed pillion riders resorted to direct fire on the shopkeeper and his employee and fled,” said Siddiqi, adding that the incident “appeared to be a targeted killing” but the exact motive has not yet been ascertained.
“They sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival,” added the police official.
“The deceased have been identified as 32-year-old Shah Ahmed, and 30-year-old Abu Bakar,” New Karachi police said in a separate statement.
“One of the deceased, Shah Ahmed, used to sell caps and perfumes,” SSP Central told Dawn.com.
Giving details of the investigation, he said, “Investigators have collected five bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol. CCTV footage has also been obtained from the spot”.
AWSJ spokesperson Umar Muawiyah, told Dawn.com that the incident marked the second such attack against their party leaders in recent times, decrying the lack of security around their head office at Nagan Chowrangi.
However, Siddiqi told Dawn.com that they had enhanced vigilance in the area “informally.”
The ASWJ, a splinter group of the Sipah-e-Sahaba (SS), was formed after the government of former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf banned a handful of religious parties, including the SS in 2002.
In a first, suspect arrested via ‘facial recognition’
Separately, in a first for Karachi Police, a man was arrested using a “facial recognition” camera.
Detailing the development, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said, “an alert was received by ERV data operator that a motorcycle rider was passing through an area having a criminal history”.
“EVR staff immediately responded, stopped the person and checked his CNIC”, confirming the suspect’s identity.
DIG South, in his statement said, “There were six FIRs registered against him including under terror charges, Telegraph Act at different police stations.”
“He was arrested in five cases in the recent past while was declared as absconder in other cases,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629615-naqvi-bilawal-call-for-unity-among-political-parties-for-pakistans-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Naqvi, Bilawal call for unity among political parties for Pakistan's stability</strong></a><br><p>

Khan, who hails from Mardan, rose to fame back in 2016 when a photographer shared a photo of him pouring tea on Instagram, which went viral. He approached the LHC in April against the blocking of his identity documents by Nadra and the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports.
An order issued today by LHC Justice Justice Jawad Hassan noted that the petitioner informed the court his grievance was redressed.
“Learned counsel for the petitioner … submits that after this court had taken cognizance of the matter, the competent authority called the petitioner to appear before the verification board constituted at the concerned office of Nadra and after due verification, his CNIC has been unblocked, thereby redressing his grievance,” the order noted.
It added that Khan’s counsel said the petitioner did not want to proceed with the main writ petition since his CNIC was unblocked by Nadra, also confirmed by the law officer after obtaining instructions from the concerned quarters.
The judge subsequently dismissed the main petition, noting it had “borne fruit”.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani said the issue was taken up at the government’s “highest level”, after which the verification process was initiated by Nadra, with the result being that the CNIC was determined to be wrongfully blocked.
Khan himself said he was a Pakistani and would always remain one.
Khan, who used to work at Islamabad’s Sunday Bazaar on Peshawar Chowk, had become popular overnight. Within no time, countless people had begun visiting his shop just to take selfies with him and soon, a modeling agency also entered into a deal with him and shot a few commercials to make good use of the craze.</p><small>2025-10-20 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201627245739e20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950159/cm-afridi-blames-centres-flawed-policy-for-terrorism-resurgence-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi blames Centre’s ‘flawed policy’ for terrorism resurgence in KP</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.
In his first official high-level meeting since he assumed the role of the KP CM on October 15, Afridi presented “important policy directives and announcements”, a post on his office’s X account said.
“Terrorism has returned to the province due to the federal government’s wrong policy,” the post quoted CM Afridi as saying.
He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”.
 






“The Centre should realise our sacrifices and release our funds on time. We can only strengthen our police and combat terrorism once we get our funds,” the chief minister said, lauding the KP police’s “unparalleled sacrifices” to eradicate terrorism.
“The bulletproof cars provided by the interior minister (Mohsin Naqvi) are defective and old. This is a mockery of KP Police. These vehicles should be recalled,” Afridi said.
Affirming that law and order were the provincial government’s top priority, he vowed there would be no compromise on it.
“The police would not face a shortage of funds. All required resources will be provided on a priority basis. The police will be equipped with modern equipment and arms.”
Responding to the KP chief minister later in the day, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry alleged that funds provided by the federal government were not appropriately used by the provincial government in the fight against terrorism.
He asserted that the vehicles dismissed as being inferior by the chief minister were of international standards and the same as those used by federal ministers, institutional officers and anti-terror operations.
“Losses are close to zero wherever these vehicles are used.”
The state minister alleged that the provincial police was being thrown before terrorists with the move and nothing was being made available to it. He said the move reflected CM Afridi’s “immature thinking”, proved his detractors right and increased the threat to law enforcement agencies.
“This is a highly unfortunate decision.”
 






Afridi vows no MPO detention or ‘political’ cases
CM Afridi also vowed that “no political individual” will be detained in KP under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected individuals to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
In a petition to the Supreme Court last year, PTI founder Imran Khan sought a bar on “indiscriminate and unlawful use of detention orders” under the MPO against political workers, rights activists and political opponents.
 
 

“Freedom of expression and constructive criticism is a fundamental Constitutional right of everyone,” Afridi was quoted as saying in the post.
He further said that no one will be arrested under a “political” first information report (FIR).
“These FIRs were registered due to political vendetta. The province has its own specific political culture; we will not let it be ruined. The [KP] police will never subject anyone to political vendettas. No FIR should be registered against any student,” said Afridi, who has remained the provincial president of the PTI’s student wing, the Insaf Students Federation (ISF).
“The situation of KP Police should under no circumstances be like that of Punjab Police,” the chief minister quipped, ordering strictly that there should be no torture of prisoners.
While vowing there would be no political interference in the police, the KP CM also warned that there should be no public complaints against it. He further said there should be separate enclaves for the police and the media in the provincial government’s housing schemes.
‘Strict action against those who succumbed to pressure’
While alleging that there was an attempt to “steal the public mandate” during the 2024 general elections in KP, Afridi hailed the provincial bureaucracy and police for “protecting the mandate of the province’s people”.
“However, unfortunately, some government officials could not bear the pressure and did not protect the public mandate,” the PTI leader said.
He vowed to reward those who stood with the people during last year’s elections and to take “strict action” against those who did not do so, directing the chief secretary to identify such people.
CM Afridi further asserted, “Zero-tolerance policy against corruption is our party’s most important agenda. […] Strict action will be taken against whoever engages in corruption.”
The chief minister also warned that if the public was not satisfied with any government official’s performance, that official would be removed from their role.
“I have not come to work in the traditional way. We will have to work outside the traditional manner,” Afridi was quoted as saying.
 
 

He also announced the establishment of Tribal Medical College and Tribal University of Modern Sciences for the merged districts, adding that playgrounds will be built on the tehsil level in all merged districts (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas). A Safe City project aimed at reducing crime was also announced for these areas.
The PTI leader said a “University of Investigation and Modern Journalism” dedicated to slain journalist Arshad Sharif will be built, while announcing another Revival Plan for Peshawar’s development.
The chief minister also pledged to end the “reference culture” for postings and transfers of government employees and to ensure implementation of the two-year policy for these.</p><small>2025-10-20 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201538261e9b535.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950130/26th-amendment-case-justice-mazhar-says-regular-benches-cannot-hear-constitutional-matters' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Justice Mazhar says regular benches cannot hear constitutional matters</strong></a><br><p>Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Monday observed that no Supreme Court benches besides the Constitutional Bench (CB) could hear constitutional matters as he and seven other judges heard petitions against the 26th Amendment.
The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Today, petitioner Muhammad Akram Sheikh, one of the founding leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and its former president, presented his arguments in the case. Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, also began his arguments. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
 


The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked Sheikh whether he was appearing on behalf of other petitioners in the case, to which the senior advocate replied that he was only representing himself.
Justice Mandokhail noted that Sardar Latif Khosa was stated as Sheikh’s counsel, at which the lawyer sought the judges’ permission to present his own arguments, saying he had the right to do so.

Justice Aminuddin then asked Sheikh to apprise the bench of a “constitutional path to form a full court”.
“We are bound by our oath. So far, not a single lawyer has presented their arguments as per the Constitution. One sahib also said to keep the Constitution aside,” the judge remarked.
Upon Justice Aminuddin asking Sheikh what a full court meant in his opinion, the latter termed the question a “futile debate”.
Then, as opposed to the other requests made so far for a “pre-Amendment” full court, Sheikh sought a full court comprising “all 24” of the present SC judges.
“This Constitutional Bench cannot hear this case,” he asserted, at which Justice Aminuddin noted that the question was how to include a “non-Constitutional Bench judge” in the proceedings.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Are you saying that even if there are 24 judges, it should not be called a Constitutional Bench but the Supreme Court?”
Sheikh argued that the 26th Amendment “destroys the total complex of the Constitution; it destroys the organ of the state”.
Calling the 26th Amendment “controversial”, Sheikh said, “No military dictator had dealt a greater and serious blow to the Constitution than the 26th Amendment”.
The lawyer contended that the CB judges had two roles at the moment, out of which one was “controversial”. “I hope that God gives you the courage to strike down this Amendment,” he said.
Sheikh argued that the current eight-member CB was not eligible to strike down the 26th Amendment as it was constituted under the same legislation.
He added that it was a set principle that a smaller bench could not reverse the ruling of a larger bench.
Here, Justice Mazhar remarked, “The matter is new now. The Constitutional Bench has been formed. Give arguments based on the new circumstances.
“You say that this Constitutional Bench cannot strike down the 26th Amendment as it would be a conflict of interest. On the other hand, you say that a full court comprising all 24 judges should be formed. Will that full court of all 24 judges not have a conflict of interest?” Justice Mazhar asked.
In February, six judges were elevated to the SC — namely Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq, and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
Justice Mandokhail also wondered whether having all 24 judges in the bench would mean that they would have the power to change an older decision.
Sheikh replied, “You yourself said that all Supreme Court judges may be nominated as members of the Constitutional Bench. […] I was glad that you have an all-inclusive approach. […] Whatever decision the Supreme Court will take, whatever collective wisdom of the honourable Supreme Court will prevail, that shall be acceptable.”
The ex-SCBA president further said, “There is an impression that the standard of the judiciary’s independence in Pakistan does not meet international standards.
“There was an election in our country. Some people thought that the election would be scrutinised. Then, a commission was made to prevent accountability, to prevent scrutiny. Background is relevant. […] As a result of which, this Constitutional Amendment came [into existence],” Sheikh claimed.
The lawyer recalled that he opposed the 18th Amendment in 2010 before the SC, because the advocate general and the law minister, being a part of the executive, should not have the right to vote in the JCP. He added that in 2015, India’s Supreme Court had struck down the 99th constitutional amendment, which aimed to give politicians and civil society a final say in appointing judges to higher courts, on a similar argument.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail told the lawyer to present his arguments on the Amendment later on, as first the CB had to decide which bench would hear the case.
“You keep talking about matters around the world, but haven’t said a word about the bench’s constitution,” Justice Aminuddin quipped.
Justice Mandokhail asked who would issue orders for the formation of a full court even if Sheikh’s argument that the CB could not hear the case was accepted.
Justice Hassan also questioned Sheikh about which bench had the power to strike down the 26th Amendment if the CB did not, to which the lawyer replied that the SC had to decide about the Amendment.
“Unless you prove that this bench is not eligible to hear the case, we cannot accept your request,” Justice Aminuddin remarked.
The bench then directed Sheikh to read out the Constitution’s Article 191A, under which the CBs in the apex court were introduced.
Justice Aminuddin remarked that some petitioners had asked the court to “refer” the matter ahead, while others had sought an “order”. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Sheikh if he wanted the CB to issue an “order that the  Supreme Court hear the case”, the lawyer replied in the affirmative.
Sheikh reiterated his request for a full court comprising all 24 judges, and added that if “any judge had any unease or burden on their conscience”, they could recuse from hearing the case.
The lawyer also voiced his support for the arguments of Advocate Munir A. Malik, who represented the Balochistan High Court Bar Association.
“Can the parliament go against the salient features of the Constitution? Can the parliament abolish an organ of the state? Can the parliament go against the basic structure of the Constitution?” Sheikh asked.
 
 

Justice Hassan responded that these questions will be reviewed in the main case.
In his arguments, retired Justice Rizvi also requested that the SC, which is “made by combining Article 176 (constitution of SC) and Article 191A (CBs of the SC)”, hear the case.

Justice Aminuddin then asked how the CB could issue an order for the formation of a full court. Rizvi replied that the CB was a part of the SC even if it was formed under Article 191A, and like any other bench of the apex court, it could refer the case to the CJP or the Practice and Procedure Committee.
Justice Mandokhail then questioned: “Even if the Practice and Procedure Committee constituted a full court, what about Clause 3 of Article 191A, according to which no other bench [besides the CB] has the jurisdiction to hear constitutional cases?”
Rizvi responded, saying, “This is a matter of the independence of Pakistan’s judiciary; this bench will have to bear the pain.”
 
 

He contended that the judges in the CB were SC judges first and hence nominated for the CB, and that Articles 176 and 191A of the Constitution should be considered together.
Justice Mazhar remarked, “The Constitution is very clear that no bench other than the Constitutional Bench can hear constitutional matters.”
The retired judge again asked that the case be presented before the SC as constituted under Article 176.
Justice Ayesha asked Rizvi whether he was in favour of a bench as per the number of judges before the 26th Amendment or after it, with Justice Mazhar wondering the same. Rizvi replied that he had no objection to all 24 judges hearing the case.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Tuesday).
The petitions
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, BHCBA’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have presented their arguments.
They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-20 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20185220fbdf97b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950171/tiktok-removed-254m-videos-in-pakistan-in-second-quarter-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok removed 25.4m videos in Pakistan in second quarter of 2025</strong></a><br><p>Popular video-sharing platform Tiktok removed more than 25 million videos over community guidelines violations in Pakistan, in the second quarter of 2025 (April-June), its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report said on Monday.
Tiktok has repeatedly been banned in the country by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) over complaints about indecent and immoral content. The first such ban came in October 2020, but was lifted 10 days later, after the company assured the telecom regulator that it would block accounts “spreading obscenity.”
According to a press release, the popular video-sharing platform said, “TikTok removed a total of 25,448,992 videos in Pakistan for Community Guidelines violations.”
“TikTok proactively removed 99.7 per cent of the videos, with 96.2pc of these videos removed within 24 hours,” added the platform.
“The report, which covers data from April to June 2025, details the proactive steps TikTok has taken to identify and remove content that violates its Community Guidelines, ensuring a positive experience for its global community,” the press release said.
Globally, the platform removed “a total of 189m videos,” which accounted for 0.7pc of all content uploaded on the platform.
The statement continued: “Of the removed videos, 163,962,241 videos were detected and taken down using automated detection technologies, while 7,457,309 videos were reinstated after further review.”
“The proactive removal rate stood at 99.1pc, with 94.4pc of the flagged content removed within 24 hours of posting,” it added.
On the matter of fake accounts, the platform said, “to uphold TikTok’s integrity,
in this quarter, the platform has removed 76,991,660 fake accounts, along with the an additional 25,904,708 accounts that were suspected to be under the age of 13.”
“A significant portion of total removed videos globally —30.6pc —contained sensitive or mature themes that did not align with TikTok’s content policies,” it said.
“An additional 14pc of videos breached the platform’s safety and civility standards, while 6.1pc violated privacy and security guidelines.”
“45pc of the removed videos were flagged as misinformation, and 23.8pc of the
videos removed were flagged as edited media and AI-generated content,” added the video-sharing platform.
In their Q1 2025 report, the platform said it had removed 24,954,128 videos in Pakistan between January and March.</p><small>2025-10-20 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2018124390967a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950167/rawalpindi-atc-again-issues-non-bailable-warrant-for-aleema-khan-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi ATC again issues non-bailable warrant for Aleema Khan in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi on Monday again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in a case pertaining to the November 26, 2024 protests by the PTI.
The warrant was reissued due to Aleema’s continued absence from case proceedings.
On November 26 last year, more than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the federal capital, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them.
Earlier this month, the ATC had issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over non-appearance in the court in the same case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, adjourning the hearing to October 11. Later, on Oct 14, the court issued a non-bailable warrant due to her continued absence, noting that she had now failed to appear twice.
During today’s hearing, presided over by ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah, the court once again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for the PTI founder’s sister, as she did not appear in court.
The judge directed Superintendent of Police Rawal Division Muhammad Saad to arrest the accused and present her before the court on Oct 22 (Wednesday).
The court also issued arrest warrants for Aleema’s guarantor, along with a show-cause and ordered the confiscation of the surety bond.
The Rawalpindi ATC also ordered that the property documents filed by the guarantor be sent to deputy commissioner Rawalpindi for verification.
Earlier in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
In Oct last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144, a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.
Islamabad ATC issues warrants for PTI leaders
Separately, an Islamabad ATC issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul, and Ali Bukhari in relation to PTI’s Sangjani rally, held in Sept 2024, it emerged on Monday.
On Sept 8, 2024, clashes took place between PTI leaders and the Islamabad police as party supporters rallied on the outskirts of the city, demanding the “immediate release” of ex-premier Imran Khan and criticising the government for marginalising the party. Following that, at least 10 PTI MNAs were arrested.
Earlier this month, the court had issued bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zartaj Gul and central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram in the case.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over the hearing today in which the court ordered that the PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub, Zain Qureshi, Zartaj Gul, and Ali Bukhari, be arrested and produced before the court.
PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat appeared on behalf of the accused, and filed an application for the transfer of the case, over which the court has sought arguments.
Judge Sipra adjourned the hearing till Oct 23.</p><small>2025-10-20 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20123541e8fdb71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950138/shan-leads-from-the-front-as-pakistan-make-wasteful-south-africa-pay-in-second-test' target='_blank'><strong>Shan leads from the front as Pakistan make wasteful South Africa pay in second Test</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan punished poor catching from South Africa to accumulate 259-5 on the opening day of the second and final Test in Rawalpindi on Monday.
Had the tourists not dropped five catches on a turning pitch they would have been in a better position after Pakistan won the toss and batted.
Skipper Shan Masood, dropped on 71 off a luckless Keshav Maharaj, top-scored with 87 while Abdullah Shafique — dropped four times — made 57.
Saud Shakeel and Salman Agha will resume on Tuesday unbeaten on 42 and 10 respectively, with the home team seeking a 2-0 series win against the world Test champions.
South African pacer Kagiso Rabada trapped Mohammad Rizwan with the fifth delivery with the second new ball for 19 to give some respite to his team.
Maharaj, who missed the first Test in Lahore through injury, took 2-63 and fellow spinner Simon Harmer 2-75.
With the bulk of the bowling done by Maharaj and Harmer, spinner Senuran Muthusamy — who took 11 wickets in the first Test — was surprisingly used for just four overs.
The final session also saw Masood fall to an uppish sweep off Maharaj, caught by Marco Jansen, after hitting two fours and three sixes in his innings.
Earlier, Shafique’s chancy knock finally ended when he edged Harmer to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne after adding an invaluable 111 runs for the second wicket with skipper Masood.
The struggling Babar Azam, again cheered by a home crowd willing him to return to form, was dismissed for just 16 when Tony de Zorzi took a low catch at silly point for Maharaj’s first wicket.
Azam has gone 29 Test innings without a century.
Maharaj himself dropped Shafique on 15 off his own bowling and then saw Aiden Markram drop the same batter on 41 and 53.
Shafique also survived on nine when a Jansen delivery rolled onto the stumps but did not dislodge the bails.
Shafique admitted he was lucky.
“You need luck in cricket and I was lucky today,” said Shafique.

“Catches get dropped in cricket and today we benefitted from them and now we need to post a 350-plus total from here.”

In the morning session South Africa’s only breakthrough came from Harmer, who bowled Imam-ul-Haq for 17 with a sharp turner that beat the bat and hit off-stump.
Rabada was also unlucky when Tristan Stubbs dropped Shafique in the slips off the fourth ball of the match when he was on nought.
“It was an even day because we controlled their run rate,” said Maharaj.
“We know how important are catches but no-one means to drop catches although it was frustrating.”
Having won the first Test in Lahore by 93 runs, Pakistan included a third spinner in Asif Afridi, dropping fast bowler Hasan Ali.
At 38 years and 299 days, Asif became the second oldest Pakistani Test debutant, behind Miran Bakhsh, who made his debut at 47 years and 284 days against India in 1955.

“We are distributing the first cheques today”, she said while addressing the attendees at a camp set up in Dipalpur, Okara to begin the distribution of relief cards among the families and individuals affected by the recent floods.
Last month, the Punjab government announced that it would be issuing relief cards for flood victims to receive aid without them having to wait in long queues.
After distributing the cards today, CM Maryam said the rehabilitation drive was funded entirely by the Punjab government’s resources.
“I did not ask for assistance from the rest of the world […] I did not ask anyone for help,” she remarked, adding that by limiting the funding for flood relief and rehabilitation activities to Punjab’s resources, she had been mindful of the “self-respect of the people” of the province.
 






The chief minister elaborated that 70 per cent of the survey launched earlier to assess the losses caused by the recent floods in the province had also been completed.
“The biggest survey in history and the most transparent survey” was initiated and Punjab’s resources also financed it, she said.
Following the partial assessment, the government was now beginning the provision of compensation in 15 districts of Punjab, namely Okara, Jhang, Multan, Bahawalpur, Nankana, Muzaffargarh, Sahiwal, Lodhran, Bahawalnagar, Sargodha, Toba Tek Singh, Vehari, Kasur, Narowal, and Gujranwala, she announced.
The CM asserted that under the initiative, Rs100bn allocated for flood victims would only go to them as “I have blocked all means of corruption”.</p><small>2025-10-20 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629559-cm-afridi-pledges-action-against-officials-who-undermined-peoples-mandate' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi pledges action against officials who 'undermined people's mandate'</strong></a><br><p>

According to the World Bank, borrowing in foreign currencies exposes clients to the risk that debt and debt service payments (as measured in local currency) increase when the local currency depreciates. However, by converting to local currency, clients are able to address that risk.
The statement released by the central bank today said that the agreement, signed under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) framework, would enable the IFC to “manage currency risks more effectively” and increase its investments in Pakistani rupees.
“This is an important step towards unlocking financing for critical sectors of the economy and creating jobs across the country,” the SBP statement said.
 






It also quoted SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad as saying that promoting private sector growth in Pakistan was “paramount to successful, sustainable economic development of the country”.
He added that the partnership with the IFC was aimed at enhancing financing opportunities for the private sector.
John Gandolfo, IFC vice president and treasurer for treasury and mobilisation, said: “With currency volatility posing significant risks to developing economies, access to local currency financing has never been more important.”
He said promoting this type of financing was a “strategic priority” for the World Bank Group and a catalyst for economic growth in Pakistan.
The statement noted that exchange rate risks remain a major challenge for companies in developing economies that borrow in hard currencies such as the US dollar while earning revenue in local currencies.
“The IFC is committed to leveraging innovative financial instruments and strengthening partnerships to address the growing need for local currency financing in emerging markets. Through this partnership with IFC, the SBP aims to bolster economic resilience, promote private sector development and improve foreign exchange liquidity in Pakistan,” the statement said.
The development comes after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, during a week-long visit to Washington, discussed private sector investment, infrastructure financing, and development cooperation in meetings with senior officials of the IFC and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, IFC regional vice president, the minister had highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country.
“We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework,“ he had said.
Both sides had agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-20 11:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201522590eef26c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948885/financing-clean-air' target='_blank'><strong>FINANCING CLEAN AIR</strong></a><br><p>AWARENESS, action, the required funding for the said action, implementation, and, finally, the results of the said action — these are all very different things. A case in point is the air pollution in Pakistan. The air we breathe has been foul for decades. Among the earliest measurements of air pollution in Pakistan was a study conducted in Lahore in 1978, cited in the International Journal of Advances in Sustainable Development. The metric used was Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), a broader measure that predates today’s more precise focus on particulate matter. The study recorded an average SPM concentration of 332μg/m³ in Lahore’s commercial core — an extremely high level of particle pollution by any standard. And, yet, it is only in recent years that the idea of combatting the noxious air we all breathe has come into focus. For many of us, growing up, the extent of our knowledge was limited to ‘plant more trees’.
So, what exactly is wrong with the air we breathe? Before financing questions can be addressed, the pollutants themselves must be understood. As energy expert Ammar Habib Khan explains, it comes down to particles and gases — carbon, nitrogen oxides, or a toxic mix of both — released largely from two sources: industry and mobility. On the mobility side, poor quality fuel combines with aging, inefficient engines that churn out more smoke than power. Tackling this is squarely a regulatory issue. “Private capital will always chase the lowest-cost solution even if that means more pollution,” he points out. Industrial emissions are no different. Cleaner, lower-emission machinery can certainly be financed, but unless the state enforces environmental laws, there is little incentive for industries to switch.
Globally, too, outdoor air pollution has lagged as a priority. Climate change has been the popular currency for some time now, but outdoor air pollution remains massively underfunded compared to other development areas. Between 2018 and 2022, it received only one per cent (1pc) of international development funding, according to the Clean Air Fund. This underfunding persists despite air pollution being the largest environmental threat to public health worldwide, with severe health, climate and economic impacts.
In Pakistan, the problem may have continued to go unnoticed had Lahore’s smog not made an invisible threat visible. That visibility is part of what has spurred action today. In 2025, the World Bank extended a $300 million loan for Punjab’s Clean Air Programme, supporting the province’s Smog Mitigation Action Plan to strengthen air quality management and improve public health.

INCENTIVISING DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES TO FINANCE A PUBLIC GOOD THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO DIRECTLY ACCRUE BALANCE SHEET BENEFITS IS TRICKY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT REALLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ANY MEANS.

But the scale of the challenge is enormous. Environmental expert Dr Kulsum Ahmed estimates that 128,000 lives are lost every year in Pakistan due to poor air quality, shaving 4.3 years off the average life expectancy. Air pollution, she stresses, does not discriminate between rich and poor: a recent study shows that the precautions taken by the rich, such as household air purifiers, have not saved them from catching airborne diseases. The very large number of hospitalised cases in Karachi testify to this.
Despite the magnitude of the problem, private finance has barely entered the picture. In 2021, only 5pc of Pakistan’s climate finance came from the private sector — far below the regional and global averages of around 49pc, according to the UN’s 2024 Climate Financing and Policy Recommendations.
This gap reflects not only the neglect of air pollution in global climate finance, but also the specific risks faced by investors in Pakistan: policy uncertainty, shifting subsidies and pricing mechanisms, and high foreign exchange risk given the mismatch between hard-currency investments and local-currency revenues. There is also a lack of education, data and investable use cases to give confidence to potential investors.
At the core lies a deeper paradox: clean air is a public good. There is little incentive for the private sector to finance solutions when benefits are dispersed and non-excludable. Khan argues that private capital can opt for targeted interventions in equipment to minimise pollution footprint, but without stricter fuel standards and tighter controls, technology shifts alone will not suffice. In other words, regulation is the missing piece — a theme that recurs throughout expert opinions.
This regulatory gap is confirmed by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC). For most companies, air quality management begins and ends with compliance, argues one of its reports. The lack of senior management involvement makes it clear that businesses still do not see dirty air as a financial risk. While onsite monitoring is carried out, there is little interest in how operations affect the wider airshed that communities actually breathe.
Nazish Shekha, Head of Initiative, Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business at PBC, highlights the hotspots: “Sometimes, it is as specific as a single roundabout or an intersection with too many traffic signals.” During rush hour, when cars idle longer, air quality dips sharply.
Construction adds another layer.
But beyond identifying causes, the bigger challenge remains structural: why should companies spend money fixing something that does not deliver direct shareholder returns? Yet, the impacts are already creeping into balance sheets — damaged facilities, eroded employee health, disrupted travel, etc. Smog in Punjab has even grounded flights and shut down motorways, delaying both goods and staff.
As urban residents in Pakistan become more aware of air quality through the availability of free data from monitoring platforms and weather updates, the private sector can potentially begin to be held liable for poor air quality onsite and in adjacent neighbourhoods. As a precursor to future financial risks, companies can begin following international guidelines for air quality and advocate for improved management in their supply chains, according to the PBC study.
Furthermore, investors have now become focused on certain aspects of Environmental-Social- Governance (ESG) approach with an increased emphasis on occupational health — not only workplace injuries, but the overall health of employees, both emotional and physical. A World Bank 2021 publication estimates that the global cost of health damages associated with exposure to air pollution is a whopping $8.1 trillion.
A somewhat dated report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that by 2060, the annual number of lost working days is projected to reach 3.7 billion globally. The 2016 OECD report had estimated the number of lost working days annually was around 1.2bn for the world at the time. In the long run, companies that voluntarily implement measures to improve air quality will benefit from a healthier workforce, according to the PBC report.
Even real estate offers a clue. From a valuation perspective, investment returns are higher on properties surrounded by parks and cleaner air. Subconsciously or not, markets are already signalling that cleaner air carries value, notes the PBC report. The question, then, is how to align public responsibility with private incentives. One way could be for the government to enforce strict regulations, but also reward early compliance. Tax incentives, for instance, could nudge companies to meet air quality benchmarks ahead of schedule — turning regulation into a financing opportunity, rather than just a compliance burden.
The economics make the case clear. A 2011 US Environmental Protection Agency report estimated that every $1 spent on improving air quality yields $30 in monetised benefits, mostly through health improvements. For Pakistan, where the pollution levels are much higher, it is possible the returns are proportionately higher as well. But incentivising domestic industries to finance a public good that will not directly accrue benefits is another story altogether.
There are precedents, though. In Bangladesh, where brick kilns, construction and vehicular emissions mirror Pakistan’s air pollution sources, the World Bank-backed Bangladesh Environmental Sustainability and Transformation (BEST) project is working to gather private capital. Central to this is a $170 million Green Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), financed by the World Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), and private-sector contributions (around 70pc). The CGF supports investments in reducing emissions from brick kilns, improving waste management, and promoting rooftop solar.
For Pakistan, a similar model could be transformative. There are financial tools on the table that could help direct more money into clean air projects, but most remain underused. Green bonds, social bonds and results-based financing, for instance, could improve efficiency and draw in long-term private capital if deployed more strategically. As noted by the ‘State of Global Air Quality Funding 2023’ report, by sharing risk across governments, development partners and private investors, these instruments could unlock far greater investment in cleaner air.
Everyone breathes air. And there is a strong economic case for making sure it is clean.
Regulations and incentives can push private sector entities into policing themselves, but the proof is in the pudding — implementation of policies.

The court issued the directives while presiding over the hearing of a plea filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband Muhammad Usman, who she has alleged was taken away by four armed individuals on October 14.
IHC Justice Muhammad Azam Khan heard the petition while Advocate Raja Rizwan Abbasi appeared in court on behalf of the wife.
During the hearing, the court directed that if police failed to recover the official within three days, the NCCIA central director and the Islamabad inspector general should appear in court in person.
Meanwhile, Abbasi told the court that he was unaware of the whereabouts of his client. “I don’t know where the petitioner is; I fear she may have also been abducted,” Abbasi told the court.
He added that the petitioner had called him saying she was being pressured to withdraw the petition.
“The petitioner’s husband was working on important cases and was kidnapped in a white Corolla,” the advocate said, adding that now the petitioner’s phone was also off and there had been no contact with her. He urged the court to summon the NCCIA director and Islamabad police chief.
Abbasi further contended that the CCTV footage showed that Usman was allegedly abducted in a vehicle which had a fake number plate.
To this, Justice Khan asked, “If the vehicle’s number plate is suspicious, how was it being driven around in Islamabad?”
He termed the situation a “very serious matter”, adding that there were checkpoints and CCTV cameras in the capital. He directed that calls being made to pressure the petitioner be traced using call data records.
Meanwhile, the assistant attorney general told the court that a case pertaining to the incident has been registered. He urged the court to give police time to carry out the investigation.
Petition
In the petition, Rozina had named the government of Pakistan via the interior ministry secretary, the NCCIA director general and NCCIA central director, the Islamabad police chief,  the sub-divisional police officer and station house officer of Shams Colony Police Station — where a case has been registered — and the state as respondents.
The petition, and a copy is available with Dawn.com, was filed through Advocate Abbasi under article 199 (Jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution.
Rozina contended that she had not received any call or message pertaining to her husband, adding that it was the “talk of the town that it is the malicious act of some of the state agencies who transgress their jurisdiction”.
The petitioner added that while the confinement and abduction of any individual was unlawful and created “some sense of insecurity”, for it to happen with a government official spread more fear and insecurity.
She pleaded that it was the responsibility of the Islamabad police chief, and the sub-divisional police officer and station house officer of Shams Colony Police Station to trace the whereabouts of her husband and set him free if he had not committed any offence or to produce him before a court if he had. She also said that she had filed an application at the Shams Police Station but no action had been taken thus far.
She urged the court to summon the interior secretary in person and direct him to adopt every possible endeavour for her husband’s recovery.
A first information report of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered at the Shams Colony Police Station on October 14 on Rozina’s complaint under section 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Diwali is a colourful festival involving lighting candles, worship, celebrations and prayers. It is celebrated to mark the day when Lord Rama returned home after his 14-year exile. It is a five-day festival and during this time, houses are cleaned and windows are opened to welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.
According to Radio Pakistan, the president said that the festival of Diwali “reminds us of the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil”.
He noted that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights and complete freedom of religion to all citizens.
“Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah envisioned a Pakistan where minorities would enjoy equal rights and opportunities,” he added. Zardari also lauded the services of Hindu community in education, commerce, and public service.
 
 

In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended his “heartfelt greetings” to the Hindu community in Pakistan and around the world, wishing them a happy Diwali.
“As homes and hearts are illuminated with the light of Diwali, may this festival dispel darkness, foster harmony, and guide us all toward a future of peace, compassion, and shared prosperity,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
“The spirit of Diwali that embodies light over darkness, good over evil, and hope over despair inspires our collective resolve to overcome the challenges confronting our societies, from intolerance to inequality.”
He called on people to work together to ensure that all citizens could live in peace and contribute to progress, regardless of their faith or background.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also extended his warm greetings to the Hindu community and around the world, calling Diwali the “festival of lights, hope, and renewal”.
In a press release issued by Bilawal House Media Cell, Bilawal said Diwali reminded us that “light always triumphs over darkness, and truth, peace, and love prevail over hate and division”.
 
 

He reaffirmed that in line with the vision of his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto, and grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP remained committed to building a “progressive and inclusive Pakistan where all faiths coexist in dignity and harmony”.
The PPP MNA lauded the Hindu community’s “invaluable contributions to Pakistan’s cultural and national life and urged all citizens to embrace Diwali’s true spirit of compassion, unity, and hope”.
Bilawal expressed the hope that the Hindu community’s lives “shine brightly — like the lights of Diwali — with happiness, harmony, and prosperity”.
 






Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also extended greetings to the Hindu community.
According to state-run APP, they said in their separate messages that Diwali was a festival of joy, lights, peace, and love.
The two also emphasised promoting interfaith harmony.</p><small>2025-10-20 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201123186a2caf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950137/anger-after-israeli-police-cancel-tel-aviv-derby-amid-chaotic-scenes' target='_blank'><strong>Anger after Israeli police cancel Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes</strong></a><br><p>There was anger on Monday in Israel after police banned the Israeli Premier League’s Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes, triggering complaints from the clubs and political opposition.
The crowd trouble at Sunday’s abandoned match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv comes amid tensions over a ban preventing Israeli fans from attending an upcoming Europa League away game against English side Aston Villa.
The match in Tel Aviv was called off after what a police spokesman described as “disorderly conduct, riots, the hurling of objects, smoke grenades, fireworks, injured officers and damage to the stadium infrastructure”.
Speaking to public broadcaster KAN, he said: “This is not a soccer game: this is severe disorder and violence.”
After the police order, the Bloomfield Stadium, the home ground for both teams, was evacuated, with police on horseback intervening to control the 30,000 fans.
Hapoel’s management was infuriated by the police decision and tactics.
“From the preliminary discussions before the game, it seemed that the police were preparing for a war rather than a sports event,” the club said in a statement published on social media.
“Everyone saw the harsh videos, children trampled by horses, police officers beating fans indiscriminately,” it said, accusing the police of taking over the sport and demanding football authorities regain control.
 






Opposition leader Yair Lapid also seized upon the incident to attack Israel’s far-right interior minister.
“To the endless list of failures of the incompetent minister Itamar Ben Gvir, tonight was added the inability to facilitate a soccer game in the State of Israel,” Lapid posted on social media.
 






Maccabi Tel Aviv was less outspoken. The club was already embroiled in disagreements over the upcoming match in Birmingham, where a local safety committee has tried to ban Israeli away fans from Aston Villa’s stadium.
The UK government is trying to reverse the ban, which has been criticised by Israeli ministers, the UEFA football governing body and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said: “We will not tolerate anti-Semitism on our streets. “</p><small>2025-10-20 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201218561db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950144/notices-issued-to-adiala-jail-superintendent-others-on-kp-cms-plea-seeking-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Notices issued to Adiala jail superintendent, others on KP CM’s plea seeking meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday removed the registrar’s objections on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s plea seeking a meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and issued notices to the Adiala jail superintendent and others for October 23.
Afridi had filed the plea on Oct 17, two days after he was sworn in as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15. He had gone to Adiala jail — where Imran has been imprisoned since September 2023 — after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court on Oct 16. However, he was denied the meeting; Afridi has stated that he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran. He had then filed a plea with the IHC, however, the registrar’s office had objected to the maintainability of the plea.
Today, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir took up the matter and overruled the objections of the registrar office.
Afridi’s lawyer Advocate Ali Bukhari said that the registrar’s office had raised the objection that the petition was filed “without the provincial cabinet and government’s decision”.
“This objection has no standing as the cabinet has not been constituted as yet,” he contended.
Subsequently, the court removed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, the Punjab Home Department secretary, the Punjab inspector general of prisons and the Adiala jail superintendent for Oct 23.
The petition filed by Afridi had contended that the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow a meeting with Imran, but no approval was granted.
The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Meanwhile, in its objections the IHC registrar’s office had noted that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.

Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Islamabad High Court had issued a notice to the Punjab inspector general of police. However, the notice has been issued to the Punjab inspector general of prisons.
