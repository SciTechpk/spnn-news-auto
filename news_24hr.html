Most seats had fallen vacant after the disqualification of PTI lawmakers due to their convictions for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 violent riots.
The six NA constituencies where polling was conducted included one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, NA-18 (Haripur), and the rest in Punjab — NA-96 (Faisalabad), NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore), NA-143 (Sahiwal) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The seven Punjab Assembly constituencies where by-polls were held were PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-98 (Faisalabad), PP-115 (Faisalabad), PP-116 (Faisalabad), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and PP-269 (Muzaffargarh).
The PTI had officially boycotted the polls in all constituencies except Lahore and Haripur, while the PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except in Muzaffargarh, and the PPP contested on two NA and one Punjab seat.

After the polling concluded, Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja spoke to journalists in the Election Commission of Pakistan’s monitoring room.
Raja said today’s by-polls were conducted peacefully and thanked the Punjab and KP governments for their cooperation.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob posted on social media platform X that if the ruling PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, “it will not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future, or in other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!”
 






Lahore
In NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), the seat fell vacant following the death of former Punjab governor and PTI stalwart Mian Muhammad Azhar. His grandson Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad is now contesting the by-poll, while the PML-N has fielded Hafiz Mian Muhammad Noman.

As polling neared its end, absconding PTI leader Hammad Azhar alleged on X that “voter booklets” were missing.
“Confirmation from [PTI leader] Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed sahib’s son regarding missing voter booklets. It is now essential for all activists to remain at polling [stations till] issuance of Form-45,” Azhar wrote, telling workers to follow the presiding officers till the returning officer’s (RO) office.
 






In another post, Azhar shared the purported audio of Arsalan, who claimed he had been stopped from entering the RO’s office and that only Noman’s vehicle was to be allowed inside.
Yet another post by him alleged: “Police and presiding officer leaving this [the] Samanabad polling station without counting.”
 






Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi also accused the authorities of “uprooting almost 99 per cent” of the PTI’s camps outside polling stations in Lahore.
Qureshi pointed out the low voter turnout and claimed that the PML-N attempted to “sabotage the by-polls by distributing more than half of the polling stations’ lists” in other areas, resulting in voters heading to the wrong polling stations.
 






The PTI also alleged that “multiple” of its workers were injured after the Punjab police and PML-N-backed men attacked them at a polling station.
Earlier in the day, the PML-N shared a video of purported PTI camps having no party workers and no voters as of 12:30pm at multiple polling stations in Samanabad and on Poonch Road. Meanwhile, the video showed people gathering at PML-N camps.
On the other hand, later in the day, the PTI’s Sahiwal chapter shared a video on X showing supporters thronging its party camp in Lahore’s Sabzazaar area, while that of the PML-N had comparatively fewer people.
 






PML-N’s Bilal Farooq Tarrar, who won the Wazirabad by-elections earlier this month, visited a polling station in Gulshan-i-Ravi, where party supporters greeted him.
PML-N’s Rana Mashhood Ahmad, head of Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, cast his vote at the Pak Angel School polling station in Union Council 100, APP reported.
He said, “Every vote given to Hafiz Mian Muhammad Nauman is a guarantee of a fair and strong mandate to advance the journey of public service, transparent leadership and sustainable development.”

Earlier in the day, Azhar alleged on X that ballot paper books received by the presiding officers at polling station No.330 (Government Model Girls High School, Samanabad) were less than the number of books issued to them.
However, an official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the serial numbers (5179-5194) mentioned in Form-36 (“Packing Invoice” containing the quantity of ballot paper books) confirmed that 15 ballot books had been issued.
 






Faisalabad
Faisalabad witnessed elections on two NA seats, NA-96 and NA-104, and three provincial seats — PP-98, PP-115 and PP-116.
In NA-96, the PML-N fielded Muhammad Bilal Badar Chaudhry, brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
According to APP, 16 candidates, including several independents, were in the contest for the seat, which was vacated after the disqualification of PTI’s Rai Haider Ali Kharal. The constituency comprises 372,133 male voters and 272,991 female voters.
 


The PTI issued a show-cause notice to Azra Parveen, the deputy coordinator of the party’s women’s wing in Faisalabad, for contesting for the seat in violation of the party’s stated policy.
“Therefore, you are hereby called upon to explain yourself in writing within five days of this notice why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for violating party policy,” the notice read.
The notice warned that if her reply was unsatisfactory or she did not respond, further action would be taken against her as per the party policy and rules.
 






In NA-104, the PML-N had nominated Daniyal Ahmed, who contested against three independent candidates. Ahmed previously contested the elections and lost to PTI ally Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who secured 132,655 votes. Ahmed is the son of former NA opposition leader Raja Riaz.
The voter turnout was reported to be low as of 12pm. However, as the day progressed, an increasing rush of voters was witnessed, APP quoted an ECP spokesperson as saying. A total of 557,637 voters were eligible to exercise their franchise in the NA constituency.
The PML-N set up its party camps outside numerous polling stations, while Ahmed’s rival, Rana Adnan Javed, did not have his camps outside many stations.
Video footage of Faisalabad City Police Officer Bilal Omer’s visit to multiple polling stations also showed barely any voters present, with cops filling the venue instead.

In PP-98, the PML-N had nominated Azad Ali Tabbasum, who competed against nine independent candidates.
Workers at the camps of PML-N’s Tabbasum and independent candidates Wasim Akram Chattha and Haji Ajmal Cheema at a government school polling station reported “almost no voters” at around 12pm.
Due to the low turnout, an announcement was later made on a mosque’s loudspeaker in Chak Jhumra tehsil’s Chandian Talawan locality, urging people to cast their ballots.
The party had not nominated any candidate in this constituency in the 2024 elections, backing instead the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) candidate Muhammad Ajmal, who was the runner-up to PTI-backed Junaid Afzal Sahi.
In PP-115, the ruling party’s candidate Muhammad Tahir Pervez faced three independents and an Awami Justice Party Pakistan (AJPP) candidate. Pervez also contested the 2024 polls and remained the runner-up to PTI-backed Shahid Javed.
In PP-116, the PML-N had nominated Ahmed Shaharyar, the son-in-law of Senator Rana Sanaullah. He contested against five independents and a Pakistan Nazriyati Party (PNP) candidate.
Shaharyar also cast a vote for himself. In the 2024 polls, he was the runner-up with 52,517 votes.
 






Speaking to the media, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency about the polling process.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” he said, adding that the PML-N deserved the ballot for serving the people.
On the PTI’s boycott of the by-polls, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Asked about reported violations of the electoral code of conduct, the senator asserted that there had been no arrests or legal actions taken against any political opponent in the entire constituency.
 


Later, the returning officer of Faisalabad-XIX issued notice to PML-N leader Abid Sher Ali over the violation of Section 178 (d) of the Elections Act, which addresses the matter of interference with the secrecy of voting.
The notice was issued after a video showing Ali casting his vote surfaced.
In this notice, seen by Dawn, Ali was asked to explain his position on Monday (tomorrow).
More than 6,500 security personnel were deployed at 1,240 polling stations established in the five constituencies of Faisalabad, APP quoted a police spokesman as saying. The stations included 64 of Category-A, 610 of Category-B and 566 stations of Category-C.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nasir Mahmood Bajwa reviewed the security of Category-A and Category-B polling stations with other senior officers in PP-115 and PP-116.
All independent candidates of the five constituencies had claimed that they had been backed by the PTI leadership. It is pertinent to mention that the PTI had announced the boycott of these by-elections, except for those in Haripur and Lahore.
The PML-N was likely to win all five seats in Faisalabad thanks to the PTI’s official boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.
Separately, in a statement, the provincial election commissioner’s office said a man, identified as Muhammad Kaleem, was arrested for sharing a video of his ballot paper with a vote for the PML-N on social media.
“Violating the secrecy of the vote is a legal offence,” the district returning officer was quoted as saying.
The ECP official directed security officials to ensure that no voter entered the polling stations with their mobile phones. Directives were also issued to the presiding officers and the polling staff to ensure secrecy of the vote.
Dera Ghazi Khan
In NA-185 (DG Khan-II), PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa and the PML-N’s Mehmood Qadir Khan Leghari were among the key candidates. The seat had fallen vacant after the disqualification of PTI’s Zartaj Gul.
The voters’ enthusiasm defeated the PTI’s boycott call as the constituency witnessed a 25pc turnout in the city areas and 30pc in rural areas.
The by-elections were held peacefully, with 3,000 police officials performing their duties.
 






Besides Khosa and Leghari, other aspirants included independent candidates Allah Bakhsh, Zafar Bashir and Mureed Hussain; PNP’s Sohail Meheruddin; Abdul Aziz Baloch of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Pakistan (JUI-P) and Nawab Muhammad Ali Faisal of All Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah).
Leghari, a sitting MPA, is a self-made businessman, not directly related to the family of late former president Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari.
NA-185 is one of the three NA constituencies in the district and encompasses populous urban areas, according to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
A total of 226 polling stations with 860 booths were set up, including 434 male and 426 female booths. The constituency has 418,310 registered voters, comprising 222,392 men and 195,918 women.
From an administrative and security perspective, 4 polling stations were declared highly sensitive, 53 as sensitive, and 169 as normal.
Haripur
While the PTI had announced an official boycott of most by-elections, it contested on Haripur’s NA-18 seat left vacant after the disqualification of former NA opposition leader Omar Ayub.
The PTI leader’s wife, Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, contested the seat and faced PML-N’s Babar Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk. Shehrnaz had been allotted the “kettle” symbol.

While the turnout remained poor between 8am and 12pm due to the cold winter weather, there was a sudden increase in voters showing up at polling stations after 12pm, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Former KP minister and Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz.
“The election commission’s biased approach is evident from the posting of presiding officers, other polling staff, and changing our election symbol,” he said. He acknowledged that the voter turnout remained low but expressed the hope that, despite all the bias, the PTI candidate would win the election with a margin of 100,000 votes
PTI Haripur President Raja Ehtesham also expressed his reservations over the election arrangements.
Shehrnaz contested an election for the first time. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings and only addressed women-specific election meetings.
Polling was largely peaceful with no poll-related violence reported from across the constituency, which spans about 1,726 square kilometres.
Speaking to the media in Haripur’s Khalabat Township, Ayub said he was hopeful of a “clean sweep” on all 29 polling stations in the union council. Another video shared by the PTI showed camps of the PML-N set up outside a polling station in Haripur.
 






A total of 753,944 registered voters, comprising 392,339 male and 361,605 female voters, were expected to cast their ballots, according to the ECP.
APP reported that 602 polling stations were established across the constituency. Of these, 462 stations were declared normal, 100 sensitive, and 40 highly sensitive. The ECP deployed 4,414 polling staff to manage the electoral process.

Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Sahiwal
For NA-143, PML-N has fielded Muhammad Tufail Jutt against independent candidate Zarrar Akbar Choudhary.
 






According to last updates received until midnight, unofficial and preliminary results showed that PML-N’s candidate was in the lead in this constituency.
In PP-203, the PML-N’s Muhammad Hanif Jutt, brother of Muhammad Tufail Jutt, contested against independent candidate Sardar Falak Sher Dogar.

Sargodha
From PP-73, the PML-N has fielded Mian Sultan Ali Ranjha as its candidate.
 






Mianwali
In Mianwali’s PP-87, the PML-N has fielded Ali Haider Noor Khan as its candidate.
 






Muzaffargarh
In PP-269 of Muzaffargarh, Mian Alamdar Qureshi is contesting as the PPP’s candidate.
Polling at the Karam Dad polling station was “paused for a few minutes” following clashes between two parties, the spokesperson for the election commissioner of Punjab said in a statement.
“However, later on, law enforcement agencies confirmed that the polling had resumed after a short break,” the spokesperson said.
Security personnel deployed
According to the ECP’s code of conduct for the armed forces, troops will be deployed outside polling stations declared “most sensitive” and will remain in quick-response mode at the remaining stations as third-tier responders.
The personnel have been directed to perform duties strictly in accordance with Article 245 of the Constitution, the law and the mandate assigned to the armed forces to assist the election regulator.
While stationed outside selected polling stations, they have been instructed to focus solely on ensuring a secure environment, complying with all relevant laws, and maintaining public confidence by safeguarding voters and preserving law and order throughout the polling process.
They have been barred from preventing any eligible voter from entering a polling station, except in cases involving weapons, explosives, prohibited items or attempts to incite violence or threaten national security.
Out of a total of 2,792 polling stations, 408 were declared highly sensitive and 1,032 sensitive across the 13 constituencies, APP reported, citing official sources.
In Punjab, where by-elections for 12 of the 13 vacant seats are taking place, more than 20,000 police personnel have been deployed for security in the province’s national and provincial constituencies.
In a post on X, the Punjab police said it was on “high alert”. It asserted there was “zero tolerance” for the violation of the ECP’s code of conduct, restrictions under Section 144, and the ban on arms.
 






“The polling process is being continuously monitored from the Central Police Office, the Safe City Authority, and the control and monitoring rooms of districts,” the police said.
Noting that the police had the full assistance of the Rangers and the army, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said, “All formations, including the Dolphin Squad, Special Branch and CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department), are being employed for the elections’ security.”

In a final that swung wildly in the space of 40 minutes, Pakistan were bowled out for 125 after yet another top-order meltdown, only for their spinners to rip through Bangladesh ‘A’ and leave them reeling at 53 for 7.
A gritty 43-run eighth-wicket stand between Rakibul Hasan and SM Meherob threatened the unthinkable, before three huge sixes in the 19th over from Abdul Gaffar Saqlain took the game to a Super Over.
Ahmed Daniyal lean-bowled both batters in the first four balls of the Super Over to restrict Bangladesh to just six.
Ripon Mondol, Bangladesh’s hero with the ball in the main game, started superbly with two yorkers but Saad Masood’s flicked four off the third legitimate delivery sealed a famous victory for Pakistan Shaheens.
Earlier, Shaheens’ batting woes resurfaced on a tricky two-paced surface. They lost Yasir Khan to a run-out off the very first ball when Gaffar’s brilliant direct hit caught the opener short.
Two balls later, Mohammad Faiq was castled by left-arm spinner Meherob and when Ghazi Ghori played down the wrong line to Rakibul, Pakistan were 25 for 3 in the powerplay.
Maaz Sadaqat counter-attacked briefly with a 23-ball 23, but once he chopped on against part-time off-spinner Jishan Alam, the innings fell away.
Only Arafat Minhas (25) and a fighting 38 from 26 balls by Saad — the only batter to strike at above 100 after the powerplay — offered resistance.
Bangladesh’s spinners strangled the middle overs, Rakibul finishing with 2-16 and Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby a miserly 0-17 from his four.
Mondol then blew away the lower order with a devastating 19th over that yielded three wickets for just two runs, including two pinpoint yorkers.
Chasing 126, Bangladesh looked well set at 36 for 1 after four overs, Habibur Rahman Sohan having launched Ubaid Shah for a huge six. But the introduction of spin turned the game on its head.
Arafat Minhas struck with his third ball, trapping Jishan lbw, and in his next over removed Mahidul Islam Ankon in identical fashion.
Saad then produced a rank long-hop that Sohan spooned to midwicket, and when Sufiyan Muqeem skidded one through Akbar Ali’s gate, Bangladesh had lost four wickets for eight runs.
Sufiyan, the outstanding bowler of the tournament, was unplayable at times, finishing with 3-11 from four overs including two googlies that crashed into the stumps.
At 53 for 7, Pakistan appeared home and dry, only for Rakibul (24) and Meherob (19) to add 37 crucial runs and keep Bangladesh hopes flickering.
The drama peaked in the final two overs; Shahid Aziz was hammered for three sixes in the 19th as Saqlain took 20 runs off it.
Needing seven off the last over, Daniyal kept his nerve, conceding just three runs and two byes off the first five balls before a leg-bye off the final delivery forced the tie.</p><small>2025-11-23 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23230114eea3292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956894/fo-denounces-indian-defence-ministers-delusional-dangerously-revisionist-remarks-about-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>FO denounces Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional, dangerously revisionist’ remarks about Sindh</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) issued a strong condemnation on Sunday, denouncing Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s “delusional and dangerously revisionist remarks” about Sindh.
The FO’s rebuke came after the Indian media quoted Singh as saying: “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”
According to Indian media outlets, Singh maintained while speaking at an event in Delhi that Sindhi Hindus from his generation never fully accepted the accession of the province to Pakistan.
Sindh has occasionally featured in Indian rhetoric on Pakistan, most often during heightened tensions or significant developments inside India.
Singh’s remarks at Sindhi Samaj Sammelan, an event of the Sindhi community, could have possibly been made to bolster political support by invoking historical and cultural claims.
The FO said in its response to the remarks that such statements revealed an “expansionist Hindutva mindset that seeks to challenge established realities and stands in clear violation of international law, the inviolability of recognised borders, and the sovereignty of states”.
“We urge Mr Rajnath Singh and other Indian leaders to refrain from provocative rhetoric that threatens regional peace and stability. It would be far more constructive for the Government of India to focus on ensuring the security of its own citizens, particularly vulnerable minority communities.
“It should hold accountable those who incite or perpetrate violence against them and address discrimination rooted in faith-based prejudice and historical distortions,” the FO statement read.
It added that India would also “do well to address the persistent grievances of the peoples in its northeast, many of whom continue to face systematic marginalisation, identity-based persecution, and cycles of state-enabled violence”.
“We call on India to take credible steps toward the genuine resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people under occupation.
“Pakistan remains committed to [a] peaceful resolution of all disputes with India on the basis of justice, equity and established international legal norms. At the same time, as in the past, Pakistan is firmly resolved to safeguard its security, national independence and sovereignty,” the FO statement said.
Ties between Pakistan and India have worsened since a four-day military conflict between the two neighbours in May.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Since then, military and political leaders on both sides have issued strongly worded statements and warnings.
In early October, the Pakistani military had warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Islamabad would respond “resolutely, without any qualms or restraints”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had come in the wake of provocative remarks by the top Indian civil-military leadership.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” it said.
In his remarks, Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must “stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wants to retain its place on the map”.
Meanwhile, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
For his part, Singh said during a speech: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”</p><small>2025-11-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635082-fo-slams-indian-defence-ministers-provocative-delusional-remarks-on-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>FO slams Indian defence minister's 'provocative, delusional' remarks on Sindh</strong></a><br><p>

The strike, the first on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital in months, targeted Hezbollah’s acting chief of staff, Ali Tabtabai, the military claimed in a statement.
There was no immediate confirmation of his killing from Hezbollah, although senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qmati confirmed a central figure from the group had been targeted.
Speaking near the bombed-out building in the Haret Hreik suburb, he said Israel’s strike crossed a “red line”. Qmati said Hezbollah’s leadership would decide on whether and how the group would respond.
Five dead in strike
The United States imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016, identifying him as a key Hezbollah leader and offering a reward of up to $5 million for information on him.
The Israeli military statement claimed Tabtabai “commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked hard to restore them to readiness for war with Israel”.
Lebanon’s health ministry said the strike killed five people and wounded 28 more. It hit a multi-storey building, sending debris crashing into cars on the main road below.
People rushed out of their apartment buildings out of fear of further bombardment, a Reuters reporter said.
Following the strike, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the international community to intervene to halt Israeli attacks.
In a statement, Aoun said Lebanon “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”.
The strike came a week before Pope Leo is set to land in Lebanon on his first foreign trip, with many Lebanese hoping the visit could signal the country was heading towards better days.
The November 2024 ceasefire was meant to end a year of fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, triggered by Hezbollah’s rocket fire on Israeli posts a day after the October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian ally Hamas.
But Israel has kept up near-daily strikes on Lebanon since the truce, targeting what it says are Hezbollah arms depots, fighters and efforts by the group to rebuild. It has ratcheted up those strikes in recent weeks.
“We will not allow Hezbollah, the terror organisation, to recover and rebuild its strength and threaten Israel from anywhere inside of Lebanon,” Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters after the strike.
Asked if Israel had notified the US before carrying out the strike, Bedrosian said Israel makes decisions independently.
Earlier, a senior US official said Israel did not notify the United States in advance about its strike, an Axios reporter said on Sunday in a post on X.
The official said the administration was informed immediately after the strike and a second senior US official said Washington knew for days that Israel was planning to escalate strikes in Lebanon, the post read.
 






Israel already killed much of Hezbollah’s leadership
Israel eliminated much of the group’s leadership during the year-long war, including its then-leader Hassan Nasrallah.
Tel Aviv and Beirut have traded blame over ceasefire violations since 2024. Lebanon says Israel’s continuing strikes and occupation of five southern posts in Lebanese territories are major breaches.

According to a supplementary cause list on the FCC’s website, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan has constituted a five-member bench comprising Justices Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah to hear the petition that was originally filed in the Supreme Court (SC) on July 22, 2024.
However, the review petition has now been fixed before the FCC, which was established under the 27th Amendment, on November 24.
In his petition, Raja requested the SC to revisit its earlier order suspending the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) notification of constituting eight election tribunals in Punjab.
He pleaded before the court that its order on July 4, 2024 had exposed the entire process of adjudication of election disputes in Punjab to the whims and arbitrary desires of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
On July 4, 2024, a five-judge SC bench, headed by then-chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, had also ordered a meaningful consultation between LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja for the formation of the tribunals.
The review petition pleaded that without providing any guidance with respect to the meaning and scope of the term “consultation” as used in Section 140(3) of the Elections Act, 2017, the LHC chief justice was directed by the SC to engage in consultation with the ECP.
The scope of the word “consultation” had been elaborately defined by the SC in the 1996 Al-Jehad Trust case and the same interpretation had been consistently followed in all matters pertaining to judicial appointments, it argued.
The petition contended that the view of the high court CJ with respect to the suitability of a particular person’s appoi­nt­m­ent as judge of any court should be granted the highest regard and consideration.
It said the LHC judgement had correctly held that the names of judges of the high court provided by the chief justice through a letter on April 4, 2024 may not be departed by the ECP as a matter of right or arbitrary discretion.
The view adopted by the ECP that it was entitled to disregard any name provided by the LHC chief justice without assigning any reasons had been held to be without any lawful basis, the review petition said.
Raja argued that during the hearing before the Supreme Court, two of the members on the bench were very clear in their rejection of the ECP’s claim that it was entitled to receive panels of names from the LHC chief justice for it to choose judges for appointment to the election tribunals in its discretion.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had clearly asked the ECP counsel to identify the basis in the text of the Elections Act or anywhere else in the law or in the Constitution for the contention that the ECP was to be provided panels of judges for each election tribunal to be appointed so that the commission could choose one of the judges for appointment.
“No answer to this query could be provided by the counsel for ECP,” the petition said, adding that in the law, there was no basis for the ECP demanding a panel of judges for each election tribunal so that it might reject some or all contained in the panel provided by the high court chief justice.

The win sealed for Pakistan a spot in the November 29 final.
Chasing a formidable 196, Zimbabwe were skittled for a paltry 126 in 19 overs, collapsing from 60 for 4 to 60 for 7 in the space of just five deliveries during a mesmerising 10th over from the 25-year-old Usman.
The Rawalpindi crowd erupted as the unorthodox spinner became only the fourth Pakistani to take a T20I hat-trick.
Zimbabwe never recovered from the early blows delivered by Pakistan’s pace battery.
Naseem Shah struck with his sixth ball when Tadiwanashe Marumani (four) chipped tamely to cover point, and Mohammad Wasim Jr clean-bowled the dangerous Brian Bennett (nine) with a sharp inswinger to reduce the visitors to 14 for 2.
Brendan Taylor looked scratchy and fell for eight, spooning a simple catch to Babar Azam at cover off Faheem Ashraf.
Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe’s captain and biggest hope, counter-attacked with 23 off 18 balls, launching Faheem for a huge six over deep midwicket. But once he picked out the same fielder off Mohammad Nawaz in the eighth over, the innings fell apart spectacularly.
Ryan Burl waged a lone battle, stroking an elegant unbeaten 67 from 49 balls (eight fours, two sixes) with exquisite timing and placement.
His fifty came off 32 deliveries and featured a 101-metre slog-sweep off Nawaz — the biggest six of the night — but he received no support whatsoever.
The defining moment arrived in the 10th over. Tony Munyonga top-edged a sweep to short fine leg, Tashinga Musekiwa played too early and was bowled off his pads, and Wellington Masakadza skied a slog-sweep straight to long-on to complete Usman’s hat-trick.
Usman returned later to castle Tinotenda Maposa and finish with career-best figures.
Burl continued to fight, adding 44 runs for the last wicket with Richard Ngarava (five), who was eventually run out off the final ball. But the result had long been sealed.
Earlier, a sensational late assault from Fakhar Zaman, who blazed an unbeaten 27 off just 10 balls with three sixes and a four, lifted Pakistan to a formidable 195 for 5.
Coming in at number seven, Fakhar turned the final two overs into a personal highlight reel.
He smoked Brad Evans for 25 runs in the last over, including two towering sixes and a deftly placed four, while also benefiting from a crucial no-ball that reprieved him on the final delivery.
In all, Pakistan plundered 69 runs from the last five overs after a more measured start.
Earlier, Babar Azam and Sahibzada Farhan had laid a solid platform with a classy 103-run second-wicket partnership.
Sahibzada, continuing his rich vein of form, struck a brisk 63 off 41 balls (four fours and three sixes) before falling in the 16th over to Raza’s skiddy arm-ball.
Babar, who had looked scratchy in the powerplay, grew into his innings beautifully, reaching 74 off 52 deliveries (seven fours and two sixes) before holing out to deep midwicket off Raza in the 18th over.
Pakistan’s innings began cautiously after they were asked to bat first. Saim Ayub threatened fireworks with two early sixes but perished for 13, pulling Evans to deep square leg.
Farhan and Babar then rebuilt steadily; the former racing to a 32-ball fifty with elegant drives and pulls, while Babar, after a slow start, found his timing in the second half of the innings, bringing up his fifty in 43 balls before accelerating.
A middle-order wobble — Faheem run out for three, Babar and Mohammad Nawaz falling in quick succession — briefly pegged Pakistan back to 167 for 5 with less than two overs remaining.
But Fakhar’s pyrotechnics ensured the hosts posted what appears a challenging total on a surface that offered occasional low bounce and grip for the spinners.</p><small>2025-11-23 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231933500ebe63c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956888/lifetime-immunity-for-public-office-holders-has-concentrated-unchecked-power-in-hands-of-a-few-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Lifetime immunity for public office holders has concentrated ‘unchecked power in hands of a few’: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>In a statement issued on Sunday after its 39th annual general meeting, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern over the 27th Constitutional Amendment, noting that lifetime immunity for public 0ffice holders had “concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few”.
The contentious tweak was passed by Parliament on November 13 after days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, and received the president’s assent the same day.
 
 

The amendment made significant changes to the judicial system and the military’s chain of command, and granted sweeping immunities to government officials. Under the Amendment, lifetime immunity from arrest and all criminal and civil proceedings has been granted to the president and anyone holding the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet and Marshal of the Air Force.
Referring to the Amendment, the HRCP drew attention to “escalating threats to constitutional democracy, civic freedoms, and the safety of vulnerable communities across the country”.
The HRCP said it “is deeply concerned over the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which undermines judicial independence by expanding executive control over matters that should remain free from executive interference”.
“The amendment further weakens essential checks and balances at a time when public trust in state institutions is fragile. Lifetime immunity for holders of public office has concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few, eroding parliamentary supremacy,” the commission’s statement read.
The human rights body also stressed that empowered and elected local governments were critical for deepening democracy and strengthening citizens’ participation in governance.
It underlined that efforts to curb militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan “must protect fundamental freedoms and the right to dissent”.
“Blanket internet shutdowns in Balochistan and other parts of the country have disrupted education, livelihoods, and democratic participation and must end immediately.
 
 

“[The] HRCP urges the federal and provincial governments to implement rights-respecting security measures, conduct impartial investigations into abuses by state actors, and engage meaningfully with local communities. This includes ending enforced disappearances and the use of interment centres without due process.”
“The use of the Fourth Schedule to muzzle dissent must cease,” the statement said.
 
 

The Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 (ATA) is a list of individuals placed under observation by the government on suspicion of their involvement in terrorism or sectarianism.
The statement added that the HRCP “notes with alarm the ongoing harassment, detention, and forced repatriation of Afghan refugees, many facing credible threats of persecution, family separation, and severe humanitarian distress”.
“The government must suspend deportations, ensure due process, and uphold international protection standards. Pakistan should ratify the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol and protect the right to citizenship by birth and naturalisation,” the HRCP emphasised.
It further stated that custodial torture and extrajudicial killings, “particularly involving Crime Control Department and Counter-Terrorism Department personnel”, demanded urgent independent inquiries and accountability.
“Such violations perpetuate impunity and threaten citizens’ right to life and dignity.”
Moreover, the HRCP noted that religious minorities, especially Ahmadis, continued to face mob violence, attacks on their sites or worship and desecration of graves.
 
 

The state must ensure protection, prosecute incitement, and implement the delayed commission to investigate misuse of the blasphemy law, as well as legislate against forced conversions, the HRCP statement added.
It further said that child marriage remained pervasive in the country, endangering girls’ health, education, and futures.
“[The] HRCP calls for legislative reforms to define a minor consistently across laws and declare all marriages under 18 illegal.
“Sexual harassment in educational, public and private institutions also persists; robust reporting, transparent accountability, and preventive training are essential to safeguard learning environments and workplaces.”
The HRCP also urged the government to protect climate-displaced persons, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, with safe shelter, essential services and sustainable resettlement solutions.
The authorities must also ensure long-term support for rebuilding homes and livelihoods for those affected by the recent floods, particularly in South Punjab, the HRCP said.
Lastly, the human rights body stressed that incarcerated Indian and Pakistani fisherfolk must be repatriated to their respective countries and receive humane treatment, legal representation and protection from arbitrary detention to preserve their rights and livelihoods.</p><small>2025-11-23 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231136438f62c9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956865/tejas-crash-dampens-export-hopes-for-indian-fighter-jet' target='_blank'><strong>Tejas crash dampens export hopes for Indian fighter jet</strong></a><br><p>The crash of India’s Tejas fighter in front of global arms buyers at the Dubai Airshow is the latest blow to a key national trophy, leaving the jet reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of home-built defence technology.
The cause of Friday’s crash was not immediately known but it capped a week of jockeying for influence at the event, attended by India’s arch-rival Pakistan six months after the neighbouring foes faced off in the world’s largest air battle in decades.
Such a public loss will inevitably overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts said, as India paid tribute to Wing Commander Namansh Syal who died in the crash.
Crash at showcase event in Dubai
“The imagery is brutal,” said Douglas A. Birkey, executive director of the US-based Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, referring to the history of crashes at air shows where nations and industries seek to tout major national achievements.
“A crash sends quite the opposite signal: a dramatic failure,” he said, adding, however, that while the Tejas would suffer negative publicity, it would most likely regain momentum.
Dubai is the world’s third-largest air show after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough, and accidents at such events have become increasingly rare.
In 1999, a Russian Sukhoi Su-30 crashed after touching the ground during a manoeuvre at the Paris Airshow, and a Soviet MiG-29 crashed at the same event a decade earlier. All crew ejected safely and India went on to place orders for both jets.
Fighter sales “are driven by high order political realities, which supersede a one-off incident”, said Birkey.
Powered by GE engines
The Tejas programme began in the 1980s as India sought to replace vintage Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the last of which retired as recently as September after numerous extensions due to slow Tejas deliveries by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).
The state-owned company has 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variant on order domestically but is yet to begin deliveries due to engine supply chain issues at GE Aerospace.
A former HAL executive who left the company recently said the crash in Dubai “rules out exports for now”.
Target markets included Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and HAL also opened an office in Malaysia in 2023.
“The focus for the coming years would be on boosting production of the fighter for domestic use,” the former executive said, requesting anonymity.
But the Indian Air Force is worried about its shrinking fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 29 from an approved strength of 42, with early variants of the MiG-29, Anglo-French Jaguar and French Mirage 2000 set to retire in coming years.
“The Tejas was supposed to be their replacement,” an IAF officer said. “But it is facing production issues.”
As an alternative, India is considering off-the-shelf purchases to fill immediate gaps, with options including more French Rafales, two Indian defence officials said, adding that India still plans to add to about 40 Tejas already in service.
India is also weighing competing offers from the US and Russia for 5th-generation F-35 and Su-57 fighters — two advanced models also rarely sharing a stage in Dubai this week.
‘Base’ for future programmes
India has for years been among the world’s biggest arms importers, but has increasingly projected the Tejas as an example of self-reliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a sortie in the fighter in November 2023.
Like most fighter programmes, the Tejas has fought for attention at the intersection of technology and diplomacy.
Development was initially held up partly by sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests as well as problems in developing local engines, said Walter Ladwig, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
But the jet’s long-term significance is “likely to lie less in sales abroad than in the industrial and technological base it creates for India’s future combat-aircraft programmes,” he said.
Regional rivalry plays out
Both India and Pakistan were present in force at the show, where the Tejas performed multiple aerial displays in the presence of the rival Pakistani contingent.
Pakistan disclosed the signing of a provisional agreement with a “friendly country” to supply its JF-17 Thunder Block III fighter, co-developed with China.
On the ramp, a JF-17 was flanked by arms including PL-15E, the export variant of a family of Chinese missiles that US and Indian officials say brought down at least one French Rafale used by India during an aerial battle with Pakistan in May.
At an exhibition stand, manufacturer PAC distributed brochures touting the JF-17, one of two models deployed by Pakistan during the four-day conflict, as “battle-tested”.
India is a lot more careful with the Tejas, which was not actively used in the four-day conflict in May, Indian officials have said, without giving any reasons.
Nor did it participate in the annual January 26 Republic Day aerial display in New Delhi this year due to what officials said were safety reasons associated with single-engine aircraft.</p><small>2025-11-23 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23174148b007ffe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956887/in-pictures-artists-writers-and-poets-come-together-at-the-adab-festival-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Artists, writers and poets come together at the Adab Festival in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Adab Festival saw a gathering of big names from art, literature, media and politics for a series of talks, music performances and mushairas.

Karachi faced a severe water crisis in November as prolonged power outages across the city disrupted pumping operations.
In a statement released today, the KWSC said they maintained close coordination with K-Electric throughout the crisis to restore the water supply, and officials confirmed that “citywide water services have now returned to normal.”
“All possible steps are being taken to further strengthen the water supply system in the future,” the KWSC said.
Per the KWSC, the city experienced a total shortfall of 884 million gallons of water due to electricity disruptions.
“The Dhabeji Pumping Station was hit hardest, with 132 hours and 20 minutes of power outages leading to a shortage of 424 million gallons, while the Dumlottee Wells recorded 146 hours of outages, resulting in 111 million gallons of lost water,” the statement read, quoting the spokesperson.
It added that North East Karachi Pumping Station alone faced a deficit of 335 million gallons, while smaller stations saw comparatively lower shortages — 6 million gallons at Hub and Pipri stations and 2 million gallons at the Gharo station.
Officials at the central pumping stations said operations were halted for several hours during the month due to persistent outages, the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
“Measures should be taken to ensure a stable and uninterrupted power supply,” they added, warning that repeated cable faults had already caused significant damage to pumping machinery.
The statement said that recommendations include setting up alternative feeders, standby cables, and technical upgrades to safeguard central stations.</p><small>2025-11-23 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23164807b37698f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956881/eu-and-pakistan-urge-afghanistan-to-root-out-terror-on-its-soil-ensure-womens-rights-in-joint-statement' target='_blank'><strong>EU and Pakistan urge Afghanistan to root out terror on its soil, ensure women’s rights in joint statement</strong></a><br><p>In a joint statement shared on Sunday, Pakistan and the European Union (EU) called on Afghanistan to deal with terrorist organisations operating from its soil and to ensure the protection of human rights, especially those of women and girls.
The development came as the 7th Strategic Dialogue between Pakistan and the EU was convened in Brussels. The meeting was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas.
According to a joint statement shared by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar and Kallas discussed relations between Islamabad and Kabul amid cross-border tensions last month, with both top diplomats reaffirming their commitment to regional peace, stability, prosperity, and resolving issues with neighbours through dialogue.
“The two sides called on Afghanistan’s de facto authorities to play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from Afghan soil,” the statement read.
It added that Dar and Kallas expressed concern over Kabul’s deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and were in favour of a “peaceful, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan”.
They also hoped that Afghanistan would advocate for a “credible political process aligned with the UN-led ‘Doha process’, and in line with the commitments made by the Taliban de facto Authorities to the international community”, according to the statement.
It added that the EU appreciated Pakistan’s hosting millions of Afghan nationals for over four decades, but emphasised that any repatriation must be “safe, dignified and in line with international standards”.
“Both sides called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure protection of human rights, especially for women, girls and vulnerable communities,” the statement read.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-23 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635022-from-where-is-ptis-x-account-being-operated' target='_blank'><strong>From where is PTI's X account being operated?</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to the media in Faisalabad, Sanaullah said, “We are still in favour of politicians sitting together at a table to resolve issues.”
He recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “unconditional offer“ he made in August to all political parties to become a part of the ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’ (Charter for Stability of Pakistan).
Sanaullah was speaking to reporters as by-elections were underway today in PP-116, where his son-in-law Ahmed Shaharyar is contesting as the PML-N candidate.
 
 

On the PTI’s official boycott of most of the by-elections held today, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Sanaullah, also the PM’s political aide, assailed Imran for “always creating a deadlock”, while “democracy progresses through dialogue”.
“A person is sitting in jail, and from there he wants to spread chaos, anarchy and fitna (evil) in the country, and there are also examples of May 9 and Nov 26 present,” he said, referring to Imran and the PTI’s protests.
Weeks of negotiations between the government and the PTI in December last year failed to achieve any tangible results on major issues back then, as both parties accused each other of derailing the negotiations.
Late last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there were no negotiations or talks ongoing between the party and the federal government or the military establishment.
‘PML-N only party deserving of votes’
Speaking about the by-election, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency regarding the polling process, dismissing allegations of rigging and disturbances in different constituencies.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” Shaharyar’s father-in-law said, adding that PML-N was the only deserving party for that.
On the low voter turnout, the senior politician contended that while general elections usually recorded a turnout of 50 to 60 per cent, by-polls only witnessed a 25 to 30pc turnout on average.
Sanaullah added: “There should be no such incident as Oct 12, 1999 or 2017/2018 when a conspiracy was done against Pakistan and a project was launched, which injected the culture of hatred [… and] enmity into politics.”
 


The senator said, “I contested seven elections in my constituency, out of which I won five. So my performance is in front of everyone. And as far as rigging is concerned, the voting process is being carried is in front of you, and the counting will take place in front of you.
“But despite that, if someone wants to cry foul,  and if someone has started crying foul since yesterday and today morning about rigging, then we have no solution for that,” he added.
“The era of development has returned in the name of Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Sanaullah said, referring to the Punjab chief minister’s election last year.
The PML-N leader also highlighted that the party halted certain development projects in Faisalabad in line with the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) campaigning rules.
“There were projects worth Rs70 billion to be started in Faisalabad, including a metro project and a scheme to supply fresh water to the entire city. But we requested to halt it for the time being and proceed after the election so that people cannot say we only did that for the sake of elections.”</p><small>2025-11-23 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231637202cd35da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956872/pakistan-urges-urgent-grant-based-climate-finance-at-cop30' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges urgent grant-based climate finance at COP30</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for rapid, grant-based, and predictable financing for climate-vulnerable developing countries, warning that recurring climate disasters are exacerbating debt distress and undermining development gains in nations that have contributed the least to global emissions.
The appeal was made at a high-level side event titled “Operationalising Loss and Damage: Financing Resilience and Recovery in Vulnerable Countries”, organised jointly by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and Unicef at the Pakistan Pavilion during the UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil.
Secretary for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Aisha Humera Moriani, in her keynote address, stated that Pakistan was investing heavily in strengthening national resilience despite contributing less than one per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions.
She recalled the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025 that displaced millions, damaged infrastructure and caused multi-billion-dollar economic losses. “The scale and frequency of such disasters in developing countries underscore the disproportionate climate burden placed on nations that played almost no role in heating the planet,” she said.
Representatives of the newly established Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), government officials, development partners and experts attended the event to discuss ways of operationalising the global Loss and Damage mechanism.
Panellists noted that repeated climate shocks had pushed several vulnerable economies into what they described as a “debt emergency,” forcing them to borrow for reconstruction in the absence of adequate grant-based support.
They stressed that new, additional and concessional financing was essential if Loss and Damage assistance was to be transformative rather than short-lived.
Speakers also highlighted that children were bearing the greatest burden of climate stress, with Pakistan having nearly half its population under 18.
Recurring disasters, they said, were severely affecting nutrition, health, education and mental wellbeing. “Climate disasters are not only destroying infrastructure, they are also robbing a generation of its right to safety and opportunity,” Moriani added.
The discussion further underscored the need to prioritise the Barbados Implementation Modalities (BIM), which call for simplified application procedures, faster disbursement and flexible financial windows to support countries with constrained fiscal space.
Participants also emphasised the importance of financing mechanisms that can address slow-onset events such as glacial melt, desertification and sea level rise.
Ministry spokesperson Muhammad Saleem Shaikh told APP that a significant part of the dialogue focused on support for vulnerable groups, particularly children and young people.
He pointed out that non-economic losses — including trauma, cultural disruption, displacement and community breakdown — remained insufficiently recognised in global policy frameworks.
He added that Pakistan had announced its readiness to submit two proposals under the FRLD’s initial funding cycle, aimed at rebuilding critical social infrastructure and strengthening resilience in key sectors, including agriculture, community systems and water resources.
While domestic resources were being mobilised, he said, the scale of climate-related loss far exceeded national capacity.
Calling Loss and Damage financing a matter of national survival, the ministry reiterated Pakistan’s position that climate justice and the principles of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) must guide international action. “Climate justice demands immediate access. Our people cannot wait,” the ministry stated, urging developed countries and multilateral institutions to translate commitments into tangible financial delivery.
Moriani reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with the UN, international partners and global climate finance bodies to shape an equitable framework for climate recovery.
The goal, she said, was to ensure that vulnerable countries receive the resources needed to recover, rebuild and adapt to accelerating climate impacts.</p><small>2025-11-23 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2314510197a39ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956868/after-ambani-zoo-probe-wildlife-body-reverses-call-to-curb-animal-imports-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>After Ambani zoo probe, wildlife body reverses call to curb animal imports to India</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations wildlife trade body decided on Sunday not to restrict India from importing endangered animals, after many countries supported reversing an earlier, stringent recommendation that had embroiled the private zoo run by Asia’s richest family.
Vantara, a 3,500-acre zoo in Gujarat run by the philanthropic arm of the Reliance conglomerate led by Mukesh Ambani and his family, had faced allegations from non-profit and wildlife groups of improper imports of some animals, triggering higher scrutiny by Germany and the European Union.
After visiting the facility in September, the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) issued a report this month asking India to “not issue any further import permits” as discrepancies had been found between exporter and importer trade data, and there were insufficient checks on the origin of some animals.
At the CITES meeting in Uzbekistan, live-streamed on Sunday, the recommendation was reversed after many countries, including India, the United States, Japan, and Brazil, said the measure was too premature, with some also saying there was no evidence of illegal imports into India.
“There doesn’t seem to be enough support for retaining the recommendation,” Naimah Aziz, Chair of the CITES Standing Committee, told the delegates, adding that it could consider if further regulatory measures were needed.
CITES is a global treaty that regulates trade in endangered plants and animals. India had earlier opposed the UN recommendation.
Vantara, which previously said it remains committed to transparency and legal compliance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vantara Zoo has animals from around the world
The Vantara zoo houses around 2,000 species, including exotic animals imported from South Africa, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo, such as snakes, tortoises, tigers, giraffes and spiny-tailed lizards.
While India’s delegate affirmed the country’s commitment to CITES’ compliance, Belgium and at least one conservation group, the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance, on Sunday pushed to suspend exports to India until concerns were addressed.
In September, an Indian Supreme Court-appointed investigation cleared Vantara of wrongdoing, while the facility said it complies with all laws.
European Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall said in August that EU states “will pay particular attention to any export requests directed towards India and the facility in question”.</p><small>2025-11-23 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635011-karachi-faced-884m-gallon-water-shortfall-in-nov-due-to-power-outages-kwsb' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi faced 884m gallon water shortfall in Nov due to power outages: KWSC</strong></a><br><p>

This shifting landscape framed the session ‘Truth, Trust, and Tenacity: The New Media Paradigm,’ held on Saturday, which brought together journalists Fazil Jamili, Azhar Abbas, Amber Rahim Shamsi and Azaz Syed under the moderation of Nadia Naqi.
The discussion was part of the Adab Festival, which returned to Karachi for its 10th edition at Habitt City from November 22 to 23.
Opening the discussion, Naqi noted the challenges journalists face in working and surviving in the current media environment.
“Speaking the truth comes with challenges; often we’ve seen journalists being intimidated, and the controlled environment makes it difficult to speak the truth,” she said. “With truth, of course, comes trust. Is there public trust in the media? That’s the big question; it’s a challenge, actually.”
Naqi asked how difficult it had become for traditional media outlets to remain relevant and compete in the new media paradigm, where social media, content creators, YouTubers, and digital platforms held huge influence.
Abbas, currently Managing Director at Geo TV Network, said the pervasive noise made it much harder to speak the truth. He opined, without naming anyone responsible, that over the past 15 years, “social engineering” had created clouds of lies, misinformation, and doubt aimed at discrediting the political class, journalists, and human rights activists.
“Beyond mainstream media, digital and social media are also used to spread misinformation. It takes a long time for a journalist, politician, or human rights activist to build trust, but that trust can be destroyed in a minute by social media propaganda,” he added.
“We ourselves question whether we are still relevant,” Abbas said, adding that legacy media still holds its audience in terms of numbers.
Naqi emphasised that censorship goes beyond shutting down news outlets or intimidating journalists, affecting their families as well. She noted that issues which cannot be raised on television are often addressed through digital platforms.
Shamsi, Pakistan Editor at Nukta, responded that even though digital media avoids censorship faced by traditional outlets, it comes with its own challenges.
“We exist in a time where there’s never been so much access to information,” she said. According to her, digital platforms prioritise clicks and views and appeal to the reactive, emotional side of the brain rather than encouraging rational thought. “You will prefer somebody who will agree with your views and opinions. That will confirm your bias.”
Another limitation, Shamsi said, came from the platforms themselves, including YouTube, Google, Meta, and X. Political and commercial interests shaped content distribution, where platforms profited from outrage, favouring content with sensational headlines and thumbnails.
“If you use keywords like ‘genocide’, ‘rape’, ‘murder’, or ‘Palestine’ in your [search engine optimisation], then you might get shadowbanned. Because it’s not your own platform, distribution remains an issue even in digital media,” she said.
Amid Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, social media platforms have reportedly been accused of curtailing the reach of pro-Palestine or Israel-critical content, though the companies deny it.
“Globally, journalism is struggling, and I don’t think truth is important anymore,” Shamsi added.
Moderator Naqi indicated that journalists today often felt as though they were “competing with creators on TikTok and YouTube, despite their core responsibility being to report news and seek the truth”. She questioned whether the profession itself was partly to blame, emphasising that social media had deepened divisions within journalism, including within press bodies.
Jamili, President of the Karachi Press Club (KPC), said the line between information and journalism had become increasingly blurred, largely because of social media. “Journalists themselves are confused, and even mainstream media gets caught up when something comes up on social media,” he said.
“There’s no comparison between speed and accuracy. You need time for the truth; only then is there trust. These are things we’ve abandoned over time,” he lamented.
Jamili said censorship had evolved, with self-censorship now the most prevalent form. Editors and reporters, he added, often wrote with fear.
It is worth noting that Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 158 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index 2025.
He argued that algorithms effectively replaced the editor’s role. “Earlier, editors decided which stories mattered, assessed their quality and relevance, and determined how they should be published. Now the algorithm dictates the priorities, and we’ve become captive to it.”
Speaking about KPC, he said that although it had around 1,800 active members, more than half were unemployed. With delayed wages and salary backlogs stretching three to four months, he asked, “If a journalist is hungry, how can you expect them to be honest?”
Syed, also associated with Geo TV Network, disregarded using the word “truth” and argued that it was subjective, with each religious or political group holding its own version. “My job is to collect facts,” he said, emphasising instead the need for journalists to distinguish between facts, assumptions, and opinions.
On the role of editors, Naqi noted they were once considered “untouchable”, but said the editors themselves no longer pushed back the way they used to. Jamili added that the practice of editorial writing had effectively disappeared. He mentioned that one of Pakistan’s largest-circulated Urdu newspapers no longer published editorials, yet “no one seems to care”.
In response to a question about controversial media ownership and the influence of land developers in Pakistan, the journalists stressed that such challenges plagued the industry globally.</p><small>2025-11-23 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635008-pakistan-eu-press-kabuls-de-facto-rulers-to-act-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, EU press Kabul's de facto rulers to act against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

Despite a ceasefire signed by Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israeli forces have continued to regularly bombard Gaza with airstrikes, with the latest attack on Saturday leaving at least 21 dead in the territory.
A statement issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.”
It added that the attacks had reportedly resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many more wounded.
“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
It said that the attacks also undermined international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.
“The Government of Pakistan reiterates its call upon the international community to take immediate steps to end Israeli impunity and ceasefire violations, and to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law,” the statement said.
It reaffirmed Pakistan’s principled position in favour of establishing “an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began on October 7, 2023 and has lasted over two years, with previous attempts at a ceasefire having failed. Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the onslaught; of these, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, around 342 were killed in the last 44 days since the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-11-23 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2308124313d4710.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956811/federal-constitutional-court-finds-support-in-apex-lawyer-bodies' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court finds support in apex lawyer bodies</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Two premier lawyer bodies on Saturday extended support to the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) through the recently passed 27th Amendment.
In a joint statement, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) affirmed that it was their two-decade-old demand that the FCC should be established with equal representation of the provinces for hearing constitutional and political matters, so that general public cases could be decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a timely manner.
The statement was jointly issued by PBC Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warriach and SCBA President Haroonur Rashid.
 
 

According to the statement, the FCC will strengthen the federation. It said the premier bodies were watching carefully the entire process, including the appointment of judges, and would express their concerns and grievances, when needed, through decisions and resolutions of the general houses of both bodies. The statement said that the PBC and the SCBA always stood for upholding the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of institutions, and adherence to the Constitution.
The statement also expressed regret over certain political factions within the legal community aimed at creating chaos and division among lawyers, just to achieve their ulterior political motives and promote their political agenda. They often issue statements aimed at sabotaging the democratic system of the country, it claimed.
“We strongly reject and condemn such statements issued by the non-elected people and assure that their futile exercise will soon be rendered ineffective,” the statement said.
“We, the elected representatives, want to make it explicitly clear that the PBC and SCBA, being apex bodies of the legal fraternity, were only supposed to issue statements on behalf of the ins­titutions on national issues,” it stressed.

Reuters was not able to establish the exact timing or scope of the new operations, nor whether US President Donald Trump had made a final decision to act.
Reports of looming action have proliferated in recent weeks as the US military has deployed forces to the Caribbean amid worsening relations with Venezuela.
Two of the US officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro. All four officials quoted in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of impending action by the United States.
The Pentagon referred questions to the White House. The CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official on Saturday did not rule anything out regarding Venezuela.
“President Trump is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration has been weighing Venezuela-related options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro’s role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. He has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade.
Two US officials told Reuters the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro.
Maduro, in power since 2013, has contended that Trump seeks to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.
The Venezuelan president, who will celebrate his 63rd birthday on Sunday, appeared on Saturday night at Caracas’ main theatre for the premiere of a television series based on his life.
A military buildup in the Caribbean has been underway for months, and Trump has authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela.
The US Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution.
Three international airlines cancelled flights departing from Venezuela on Saturday after the FAA warning.
The United States plans on Monday to designate the Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist organisation for its alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the United States, officials said. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of leading Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.
Hegseth: New options after terrorist designation
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the terrorist designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States.”
Trump has said the upcoming designation would allow the United States to strike Maduro’s assets and infrastructure in Venezuela, but he also has indicated a willingness to potentially pursue talks in hopes of a diplomatic solution.
Two US officials acknowledged conversations between Caracas and Washington. It was unclear whether those conversations could impact the timing or scale of the US operations.
The US Navy’s largest aircraft carrier, the Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the Caribbean on November 16 with its strike group, joining at least seven other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft.
US forces in the region so far have focused on counter-narcotics operations, even though the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.
US troops have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.
Human rights groups have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.
Washington in August doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million.
The US military dwarfs Venezuela’s, which is debilitated by a lack of training, low wages and deteriorating equipment. Some unit commanders have been forced to negotiate with local food producers to feed their troops because government supplies fall short, Reuters has reported.
That reality has led Maduro’s government to consider alternative strategies in the event of a US invasion, including possibly a guerrilla-style response, which the government has termed “prolonged resistance” and mentioned in broadcasts on state television.
This approach would involve small military units at more than 280 locations carrying out acts of sabotage and other guerrilla tactics, Reuters has reported, citing sources and years-old planning documents.</p><small>2025-11-23 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634988-judges-transfer-case-five-ihc-judges-challenge-hearing-of-plea-by-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Judges' transfer case: Five IHC judges challenge hearing of plea by FCC</strong></a><br><p>

Police officials note with concern the increasingly disturbing trend to promote obscenity, vulgarity and brandishing of weapons to terrorise citizens: the rise of negative content on TikTok, which is increasingly influencing young people.
Police say, content creators have turned to entertainment platforms like TikTok to make money by generating more views through showcasing of weapons and promoting vulgar content that is having a negative impact on society.
 
 

In some cases, the exchange of abuses on the social media platform led to fire fight between individuals, resulting in killings.
Taking note of the increasing trend, Peshawar police recently launched a crackdown against those responsible for pushing boundaries and were promoting negative content through vulgar videos and showcasing of weapons.
According to data, 91 cases have so far been registered for vulgar content, resulting in 94 arrests. Additionally, 657 cases have been registered for showcasing weapons leading to 681 arrests.
The police data reveals that majority of those arrested are men misusing the social media platform with a significant number of cases involving the display of pistols to semi-automatic and automatic weapons on the popular platform.
A local TikToker argued that there were many reasons why people engaged in abusive conversation on live videos on the social media platform. “Some individuals believe that they will get more views than normal videos, while others do it for fame, seeking attention in form of likes, comments and followers.”
Interestingly, some individuals claim that they are trying to break free from extremism, using the platform as a space to express themselves in way they feel are liberating.
But while the crackdown helped sent out a strong message with some content creators repenting their behavior in social media posts and video statements promising to become good citizens, police say that some content creators have adopted novel methods to escape the dragnet of law by relocating to other cities to be able to upload videos from outside of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Some TikTokers voiced their concern, arguing that the crackdown was an infringement on their right to freedom of expression and free speech.
They believed they should be free to express themselves without fear of censorship, referring to Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression. But police said that the freedom had limits regarding “decency and morality”.
A sociologist at the University of Peshawar said that some users might engage in such behaviour due to disconnect in their desires and reality.
“People’s desires can drive them to create negative content. The desire for attention and social media fame can lead people to create content that pushes the boundaries. This is often a result of daydreaming where people’s desires are different from reality, leading to a kind of addiction that blurs the boundaries of modesty,” the sociologist explained.

He was addressing the participants of JI’s Ijtima-i-Aam at Minar-i-Pakistan here on Saturday.
He said that the nation wouldn’t allow the government to accept the supremacy of the United States in connection with foreign policy and internal affairs of Pakistan. He said that Islam does not provide immunity to anyone, be it a marshal or a president.
He directed his party workers to invite all political workers without discrimination to join their struggle to change the ‘corrupt and dilapidated’ system.
Talking about reforms to empower people, he lambasted the Punjab government and questioned why it had not held local government elections in the past one and a half decade.
Talking about the education sector, he said the provincial governments had allocated tens of billions of rupees for the sector, yet the situation was utterly disappointing.
Taking a dig at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, he said that he claimed to be a democrat, however, he himself was a typical feudal landlord. He questioned why the people of rural Sindh were still deprived of their rights. “A capitalist mindset is making the poor even poorer,” he said, adding that the “Badal Do Nizam” (change the system) movement must also be expanded within Sindh to eliminate feudalism and oppression.
If given the opportunity, he promised to fully empower institutions at the grassroots level, establish neighborhood justice committees, and reform the judicial system in accordance with the Constitution.
He said that Bhutto and Imran Khan raised slogans against feudalism, but later made the same feudals their political guardians. “We will not come to power through anyone’s blessings but through the will of the people,” he said, adding that corporate feudalism had now replaced traditional feudalism, enslaving the public even further.
He said the movement was committed to establishing equal education for all, ensuring labour rights, and guaranteeing fundamental rights for women according to the Constitution.
He also condemned the entrenched power of feudal lords, tribal chiefs, generals, and bureaucrats who “exploit 250 million people to please their superiors.”
“The state is prepared to enforce its writ in every matter except providing education to the youth,” he said.
A prize distribution ceremony was later held to encourage the young talent in the society. Seasoned economists, political scientists and industrialists shared their views and shed light on the potential of Pakistan and the red tape culture, coupled with corruption in almost every sector.

He was talking to the media after offering condolences to the family of PPP leader Mian Manzoor Ahmed Maneka.
Mr Ashraf said that Mian Manzoor Maneka was an asset of the PPP, who stood with the party through thick and thin.
He said it was not appropriate to comment on the IMF report and take it as a benchmark. All constitutional institutions should work within their limits, he said, adding that the Chief Minister of KPK should meet the founder of PTI to seek guidance.
To another question, he said that no government wanted inflation, but it was true that it had been out of control. But now, it was bridled to a great extent.
He said that the PPP had an agreement with the PML-N that the local bodies elections would be held in the province soon.

She said that political meetings were categorically prohibited under jail regulations, and the jail superintendent was the “final authority” on all such matters. She explained that prison officials only facilitate meetings between inmates and their immediate family members and that the list of approved visitors was provided by the prisoner himself.
“If an inmate does not wish to meet someone, jail authorities cannot forcibly arrange such a meeting,” she added.

Suggests KP CM to study the law; Kundi again rules out governor’s rule

Clarifying the situation of the PTI founder, Ms Bukhari said that he was allowed meetings twice a week and had already held 420 meetings with his lawyers and 189 meetings with his family members. She noted that meetings requested by Bushra Bibi’s family were handled separately.
“Yet, every week, a rally is staged outside the jail as if no meetings are being allowed,” she remarked.
Criticising Sohail Afridi, the minister said that he should “study the law himself before attempting to lecture others”.
 
 

She accused him of standing alongside “convicted offenders of the May 9 attacks” and of intimidating government officials during political gatherings.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Kareem Kundi has again ruled out the possibility of imposition of governor’s rule in KP and termed the social media reports of his removal baseless.
He said his Friday’s meeting with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was to discuss the law and order situation and other matters related to the well-being of the people in KP.
He was talking to the media at Kothi Nawab Shaib after offering condolences with former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Gul on the demise of his brother and veteran parliamentarian Nawabzada Mazhar Ali Khan here on Saturday.
JUI-F MNA from KP Noor Alam Khan, ex-MPA Nawabzada Haider Mehdi, Gujrat PML-N president Tahirul Mulk and other members of Nawabzada family were also present at the occasion.
Mr Kundi said the KP province had been a victim of terrorism but still some elements were unnecessarily opposing even the intelligence-based operation.
He said now the educational institutions had come under attack of terrorists who had also been targeting the police, army and Frontier Constabulary which could not be tolerated.
He said the role of federal government and armed forces was vital for the peace and stability in the KP where huge reservoirs of oil, gas and other mines had been found which could become beneficial for the country and the province.
Earlier, he offered prayers for the departed soul.
Meanwhile, former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain and his son and PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi also offered condolences with the Nawabzada family on the death of the ex-MNA.
Wajahat and his son, have been the political rivals of the Nawabzada family for the last three decades in the electoral politics of NA-63 (Jalalpur Jattan-Tanda) of Gujrat district.
Senior PPP leaders Nadeem Afzal Chan, Qamar Zaman Kaira and others also visited the Nawabzada family for the condolences.

Earlier on Friday, KP chief minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi in a media interaction in Islamabad told reporters that he intended to attend NFC inaugural meeting.
He said that he was going to attend the meeting as it was a matter of provincial rights and that the Centre should pay Rs3 trillion of liabilities.
On Saturday, KP adviser to chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam in a social media post stated the shared a range of items which the province was expecting from the 11th NFC Award.

Province seeks to align Award with ‘ground realities’

He said that the KP was looking towards the financial merger for erstwhile Fata into federal divisible pool. “Currently, merged area gets special grants from federal government. This will pass on the burden on provinces and relief to federal government,” he said.
 






KP government has been of the view that from 7th NFC to 10th NFC, vertical and horizontal distribution remained intact despite25th Amendment (merger of Fata into KP).
The provincial government has been pushing to align NFC with the change in population, geography and backwardness, as post-merger province’s revised divisible pool share goes up to 19.64 per cent of the total instead of existing 14.62 per cent.
 
 

Mr Aslam also said that the 11th iteration of the NFC Award would also hopefully remove the grievances of small provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.
He said that the province was also looking towards improvement or reconstitution of the horizontals of provincial horizontals (population, revenue, poverty and reverse population density) and adding climate, water resources, population control, own source revenue collection and human development index as new horizontals
In addition to this, he said that province was also hopeful of retaking non-divisible pool resources which the federal government passed on to provinces without any yard stick (such as subsidies). “In that small provinces are getting less as compared to larger provinces,” he said.
Besides, he said that KP was also looking towards complete devolvement of some expenditure borne by federal government to provinces which doesn’t belong to the Centre as well as identifying the new avenues to improve revenue to GDP and essentially tax to GDP ratio.
He said that they were also hopeful of serious discussion on provincial finance commission (PFC) and assessment of its current status.
Mr Aslam said that the province also looked up to restructuring and rationalisation of federal expenditures, which were challenging federal government fiscal management.
“Fiscal indiscipline and gaps identified by recent International Monetary Fund corruption diagnosis report may ensure extra resources for federal government without disturbing the 57.5: 41.5: 1 percent vertical distribution,” he said.
He said that the province also wanted independent audit of population province-wise.

Mehsud, along with his other associates, has been booked in a case pertaining to opening fire on people protesting against a fatal accident involving a dumper on the night between Nov 3 and Nov 4 in the Nishtar Road area. On the next day, the suspect had moved the court and got interim pre-arrest bail.
On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Irshad Hussain rejected the pre-arrest bail application and also recalled his interim bail after hearing both sides and examining the record.
The court noted that the act of indiscriminate firing on people by a guard of the applicant was an act of terrorism and the case should be exclusively tried by an anti-terrorism court.
The suspect appeared in court and as soon as the order was announced he managed to escape from the court premises and police as well as the investigating officer (IO) failed to arrest him.
In its order, the court stated that as per the footage produced by the IO, the applicant along with his guard was present at the scene and the latter opened straight fire at the people, which created terror, fear and insecurity among the public.
It also noted that the permit of the weapon used in the crime was also not valid as it had expired in September.
The court observed that although no one sustained firearm injuries, the act of indiscriminate firing on the people amount to use of lethal force in public.
It said that the case came within the ambit of Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and there were reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed the offences of terrorism, rioting and attempted murder.
Initially, the FIR against Mehsud was lodged under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) of the Pakistan Penal Court against the dumpers association’s head at Garden police station.

PM Shehbaz receives a presentation on initiatives to improve Pakistan Railways.—APP

• ADB approves $10m for railway improvement project
• PM for adopting public-private partnership for rail land
ISLAMABAD: With the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approving $10 million in assistance for preparing the Railway Improve­ment Project, Pakistan Railways is moving to outsource 11 more trains, a step expected to generate an additional Rs8.5bn for the country’s largest state-owned rail operator.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting on Pakistan Railways on Saturday, where he was informed that tenders had been floated for outsourcing the eleven passenger trains to the private sector. Pakistan Railways has already outsourced four trains.
 
 

The meeting was also informed that railway hospitals in Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta and Sukkur were being outsourced, while the outsourcing of railway schools, colleges and rest houses was already underway. Similarly, dry ports in Islamabad, Lahore and Azakhail were also being handed over to private operators.
It was also noted that 40 luggage and brake vans had been outsourced, which are expected to bring in an additional Rs820m. The outsourcing process for two cargo express trains was in progress and is projected to generate Rs6.3bn in additional revenue.
Addressing the meeting, the premier stressed that a public-private partnership model shou­­ld be adopted when managing Pak­istan Railways’ land and properties.
 
 

He said that the railway system serves as the backbone of a country’s economy and directed that top-tier legal and economic experts be engaged, especially for projects related to regional connectivity and cross-border rail links.
He appreciated the ongoing measures for the revival of the railway system and commended Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and his team.
The meeting was infor­med that the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul train service would resume soon, and preliminary work on the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan rail corridor was underway.
A plan was being developed for upgrading the Karachi–Kotri section of Main Line-1 and Main Line-3.
The premier was informed that so far, 155 railway stations have been equipped with solar power. Seven digital portals under the ‘Rabta’ initiative are operational, 56 trains have been shifted onto the new system, and 54 stations have been digitised.
Free Wi-Fi service has been provided at the Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad stations.
An online freight booking system has been launched while a pilot digital weighing bridge has been installed at Karachi City Railway Station.
To enhance security, 148 AI-powered surveillance cameras have been installed, and ATM machines are being set up at railway stations.
Cleanliness services have also been outsourced.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the bail petition during a hearing held at Kot Lakhpat jail.
Barrister Taimur Malik argued on behalf of the petitioner and referred to the rule of consistency applied to other accused people, including PTI founder Imran Khan, former senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema by the courts granting bail to them in similar cases.
The judge approved the bail for Dr Rashid in the case, subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs100,000.
However, he adjourned the hearing of the PTI leader’s bail petitions in three other cases till Nov 25.
In a statement, Barrister Malik said his client should be granted bail in the remaining cases as well on the same legal principle.
He added that later if the high court accepted her suspension applications, she could be released pending the outcome of her appeals against the convictions. The PTI Punjab president has already been convicted in four other May 9 cases including an attack on the Shadman police station.
Statements recorded
An anti-terrorism court also recorded the statements of 10 police personnel in a case related to violence at GOR-I neighbourhood during the May 9 riots.
The prosecution presented the police officials as its witnesses. A prosecutor told the court that 57 witnesses had testified in the case so far. The court summoned more prosecution witnesses on Nov 25. The Race Course police had registered the case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking the main gate of GOR-I Club Chowk and damaging property.

• Drone attack on Lebanon leaves one dead, five hurt
• Canadian PM, UAE president back comprehensive Palestinian peace plan
• Hamas says ‘escalating violations’ place a responsibility on mediators and US
CAIRO: Israel continued its deadly assault blatantly violating ceasefire agreements on two fronts with airstrikes on Saturday that killed at least 21 people in Gaza and one in southern Lebanon, despite assurances from Palestinian resistance groups that they remain fully committed to the accord.
Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 21 people and wounded several others, local health authorities said, posing a further test to the six-week-old ceasefire.
Witnesses and medics said the initial attack struck a car in the densely populated Rimal neighbourhood, setting it ablaze. It was not immediately clear whether the five dead were passengers in the vehicle or included passersby. Dozens of people rushed to extinguish the fire and rescue the victims.
 
 

Shortly after the attack on the car, the Israeli air force carried out two separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah city and Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least four people and wounding several others, medics said.
The Israeli military claimed a gunman had exploited the “humanitarian road in the area through which humanitarian aid enters southern Gaza” to cross into Israeli-held territory. The military said it was striking targets in Gaza in response.
A Hamas official in Gaza rejected the Israeli military’s allegations as baseless and an “excuse to kill”, insisting the group was committed to the ceasefire agreement.
Hamas said in a statement earlier on Saturday that Israel’s “escalating violations” place a responsibility on mediators and the US to confront the aggression and preserve the ceasefire.
While the October 10 ceasefire in the Gaza war has eased the conflict — enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins and increasing aid flows — violence has not completely halted.
Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed 316 people in strikes in Gaza while Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began since the truce began. Some observers are concerned Israel is seeking to reassert itself.
Attacks in Lebanon
Violations also continued on another front, where an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed one person on Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The death occurred in the latest attack despite a nearly year-long ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
In a statement, the ministry attributed the death to “an Israeli enemy strike” on a vehicle in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah. The National News Agency identified the man killed as Kamel Reda Qarnabash.
The ministry also reported that a grenade dropped by an Israeli drone in the southern town of Shaqra wounded five people.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the deadly incident in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah but claimed it struck “several Hezbollah launchers that were recently identified and placed in military sites in southern Lebanon”.
Lebanon has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement reached in Nov 2024 by continuing its strikes and maintaining forces inside Lebanese territory. According to the health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Lebanon and 945 wounded since the ceasefire.
The attacks follow an Israeli strike Tuesday night on the Ain al-Hilweh camp for Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon that killed 13 people.
A secondary school in the camp stated on its Facebook page Thursday that two of its students were killed in the attack, publishing an image of two adolescent boys.
Canadian PM, UAE president meet
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met on Nov 20 in Abu Dhabi to advance bilateral ties and discuss Gaza peace plan, Canada’s government said on Saturday.
Regarding Gaza, the leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” based on the two-state solution, leading to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.
Both sides welcomed the leadership of US President Donald Trump and his “comprehensive peace plan” to end the war in Gaza, as well as the adoption of Resolution 2803 by the UN Security Council as a key instrument for implementation.

I’m always glad to see regional and provincial languages promoted at our literary festivals, and this year at Adab, one of the languages of Gilgit-Baltistan — Burushaski to be precise — was included in a mushaira in which poets Ahmed Ali Jan and Qamar Kazmi participated.
This inclusion resonated with me this year because I’ve been teaching expository writing at the AKU’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences this semester, and many of my students come from Gilgit-Baltistan, Chitral, Hunza, Kohistan. They’ve left their homes up in the mountains to seek knowledge in the big bad city of Karachi, but they’re also educating everyone here about themselves, their land, culture, norms and values, and their dreams and hopes for the future.
At first I had no idea of Gilgit-Baltistan’s Buddhist history, or how Sufi preachers brought Islam to Baltistan from Persia and Central Asia. Nobody taught me that the Gilgit Scouts mutinied in 1947 to overthrow the Dogra kings of Jammu and Kashmir, and that’s how Gilgit-Baltistan came under Pakistan’s jurisdiction. We still operate in a headspace where those separate regions are collectively and dismissively called ‘the Northern Areas’ and envisioned as a land of great natural beauty simply waiting for us to discover it. We lack true understanding or knowledge of its rich history, culture, religions, and societies. Part of this is because of its isolation — the Karakoram Highway reconnected Gilgit-Baltistan by road to the rest of the country in 2017. But even now, we do not care to learn about their religions, their folklore, or their political aspirations to becoming a fifth province of Pakistan.
I now know the names of the languages: Burushaski, Shina, Khowar and Waakhi, as I hear the students speaking them every day in the halls of the university. These young adults are trying to figure out their place in the federation of Pakistan. As their society transitions, they are vulnerable to outside forces that threaten to overwhelm their culture and exploit their material wealth. The promotion of Gilgit-Baltistan’s languages and literature (mostly an oral tradition) at festivals that can showcase their art, their music, their culture, their scholars, is a huge opportunity for cultural diplomacy within our nation.

We lack true knowledge of GB’s rich history.

This year, sociologist Dr Nosheen Ali and research scholar Aziz Ali Dad have established the very first independent press in Gilgit-Baltistan, Raachi Publications. It is named after the traditional female deity who is the guardian spirit of the land. Raachi’s first book is Beyond the Mountains: Social and Political Imaginaries in Gilgit Baltistan, co-edited by Dr Ali and Aziz Ali Dad. It’s been successfully launched in Pakistan, the UK and the US, where Dr Ali teaches at New York University. When Aziz Ali Dad gave a talk at my university this month, I was informed the book is already out of print.
The book consists of 16 chapters written by different researchers that explore a multitude of facets about life, land and social thought in Gilgit-Baltistan. Muhammed Feyyas discusses geopolitics, statehood and violence; Khalid Manzoor Butt writes of ethnic diversity and collective actions. There are several chapters on politics and governance in Gilgit-Baltistan, and how the people are struggling for participation. Dr Ali writes a chapter identifying Gilgit-Baltistan as the “Eco-Body” of the nation. The book is a perfect representation of the region: multilingual, collaborative and indigenous, which also reflects the ethos and social awareness of its people as it passes throu­­gh a crucible of mo­­dernisation and de­­-velopment. They worry: what of theirs will truly survive?
Another thing I have learned is the Gilgit-Baltistan reverence for the natural world and everything in it. The animist religious tradition believed that not just humans, but also animals, mountains and rocks have a spirit; glaciers have genders and can be ‘married’ (as described in Uzma Aslam Khan’s excellent Thinner Than Skin).
Aziz Ali Dad spoke of how Gilgit-Baltistan is the land of juniper trees, and that these trees were where fairies loved to perch in throngs. But now, instead of fairies, people look at those juniper trees and only see the money they can fetch on the market.
The people of Gilgit-Baltistan see their land and their lives as rich, thriving and meaningful. They seek a path to development that preserves and restores their heritage, keeping their values and voices intact. Sometimes it’s hard to see the reading and writing of books as a political act, but amplifying Gilgit-Baltistan narratives is vital if we want to face the future as a unified nation, not a divided entity.

This has resulted in the total commercialisation of education, with private schools burdening parents with unreasonable costs. Taking note of parents’ complaints, the Competition Commission of Pakistan has issued notices to 17 private school systems to inquire into alleged non-transparent selling practices, such as forcing parents to purchase mandatory branded school books, stationery and uniforms. Parents had also complained of arbitrary price hikes. Many schools disallow the purchase of cheaper generic notebooks. In August, the Senate Standing Committee on Education had also taken note of complaints that many private schools were hiking annual fees beyond the legal limit. As per the law, schools can only increase fees by 5pc every year. When asked about the CCP’s concerns, a representative of a private schools’ association observed that the “topic needs some clarity”.
It is a fact that if it were not for private schools, Pakistan’s education situation would be even more dire. As per official figures from 2021-22, private institutions educate 25.5m children, which is over 46pc of total enrolled students. The figures have likely increased. This makes students, in the words of the CCP, “captive consumers”; private schools know that in order to give their children a better future, parents will enrol their kids with them. While it is true that many of these school systems are not charity institutions, and need to cover their costs, economic realities must be kept in mind. Fees rise every year, but family budgets are stagnant or rapidly shrinking. Therefore, private schools must not force parents to purchase expensive supplies from exclusive distributors, and must also reconsider arbitrary fee hikes. The long-term solution is a quality public sector education system. But until that dream is realised, private schools must not burden parents with exorbitant costs.

• Firms cut purchases by 23m kg in four years
SWABI: Tobacco purchasing companies have slashed their demand for the 2026 crop by 13.183 million kg, marking the fourth consecutive year of reduced requirements. This cutback is expected to result in significant financial losses for local tobacco farmers, sources told Dawn on Saturday.
Tobacco experts noted that while multinational and national firms have the capacity to store large quantities of tobacco, growers face major challenges due to limited financial resources and storage options. The inability to store crops like Virginia and White Patta tobacco means any surplus must be sold quickly, leaving growers at the mercy of fluctuating market demand.
For 2026, the total demand from tobacco companies is set at 61.627m kg, with 58.184m kg of flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco, 0.360m kg of dark air-cured tobacco, 1.342m kg of White Patta, 1.381m kg of burley, and 0.360m kg of sun-cured tobacco.
This marks a significant reduction from previous years, with companies cutting their demand by 23.873m kg over the past four years. In 2023, total demand was 85.5m kg, which fell to 77.322m kg in 2024, 74.810m kg in 2025, and will drop to 61.627m kg in 2026.
The bulk of tobacco purchases is made by multinational companies, with a smaller portion allocated to national companies and smaller tobacco entrepreneurs. Among multinational firms, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) and Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd are the largest buyers, with a combined demand of over 36m kg of FCV tobacco in 2026. The remaining FCV demand will be met by 78 national companies, including Khyber Tobacco.
Shift in tobacco requirements
The Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB) has noted that while demand for FCV, dark air-cured, and sun-cured tobacco has decreased in 2026, demand for White Patta and burley tobacco has increased slightly. FCV tobacco remains the primary focus for both multinational and national companies, given its use in cigarette manufacturing and export.
Iqbal Shewa, a prominent tobacco grower, stressed that both multinational and national companies are primarily concerned with FCV tobacco for export and cigarette production. To avoid confusion during the purchasing season, PTB has instructed tobacco companies and landowners to formalise agreements for the upcoming year and share those agreements with the board. Farmers have been advised to grow tobacco in line with these agreements to avoid complications during the buying season.
Price discrepancies and low profit
Ayaz Khan, a former PTB director, explained that companies are reducing their demand for the 2026 crop in part because of the price discrepancy between the weighted average price (WAP) and the minimum indicative price (MIP). The WAP for the current year was set at Rs 719 per kg, while the MIP for surplus tobacco was set at Rs 545 per kg. Companies, Mr Khan said, profited from purchasing surplus tobacco at the MIP, which was Rs174.8 less than the WAP, resulting in significant savings for them but at the expense of the growers. This year’s surplus tobacco amounted to 35.35m kg, which allowed companies to profit by Rs6.17 billion, a windfall that was not shared with the farmers.
 
 

In contrast, the farmers have faced significant losses. The lower purchase prices have put them in a difficult financial position, with many reliant on tob­acco cultivation for their annual income.
Surging exports
Despite the reduced demand for domestic consumption, tobacco exports have seen a marked increase. In 2023-24, Pakistan exported 20m kg of tobacco, rising to 47m kg in 2024-25, an increase of 135pc year-on-year. However, despite this rise in exports, companies have kept their domestic purchase demand low to avoid paying higher prices for surplus tobacco.
Mr Khan also pointed out that the increased exports have not led to corresponding benefits for local growers. Instead, the companies’ strategy of reducing domestic purchases and capitalising on cheaper surplus tobacco has disproportionately benefited the tobacco industry, while the farmers and government have borne the brunt of the financial losses.
The ongoing reduction in tobacco demand by purchasing companies is creating a challenging environment for tobacco growers, who face severe financial losses due to lower prices and limited storage options. While companies continue to benefit from price discrepancies and increased exports, farmers remain the biggest losers in this equation.
