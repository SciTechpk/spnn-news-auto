Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.”
Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country.
“We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added.
Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter.
In July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action.
More recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it.
Gandapur calls for justice
At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said.
The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ would continue until it achieved success.
Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces.
Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally.
“In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said.
Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, which seemed to be from a previous public gathering.
Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace.
Rally arrangements
According to information shared by the PTI on social media, party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally.
While television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online.
Earlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally.
The statement said 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue.
Meanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said.
Several PTI leaders visited the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar.
Ahead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.

Additional input from Zahid Imdad</p><small>2025-09-27 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27193013f6806b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944988/pakistan-skipper-salman-calls-for-aggression-ahead-of-clash-with-india-in-asia-cup-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan skipper Salman calls for aggression ahead of clash with India in Asia Cup final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan men’s captain Salman Ali Agha said on Saturday that he welcomed his players being aggressive on the field ahead of the first-ever final of an Asia Cup between Pakistan and India.
Under fire after two comprehensive losses at the hands of India in the ongoing Asia Cup, the Green Shirts proved they were good enough to make it to the tournament’s final when they edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in their last Super Four outing on Thursday and all that matters now for the side are the title honours.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Salman said: “Every individual has their own way. If a player wants to be aggressive, then why not? If you take aggression away from a fast bowler, then there’s nothing left.”
 
 

He was responding to an Indian journalist’s question about his responsibility as captain to keep his players’ actions in check.
“Every player knows how to deal with their emotions. I give the players a free hand unless they are disrespecting someone or causing disrespect to our country,” the Pakistani skipper added.
Speaking on the refusal of customary post-match handshakes by the Indian men’s team, Salman said: “I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve never seen teams not shake hands … I don’t think there has been an instance of players not shaking hands.”
He added that on previous occasions, even under worse circumstances between the two countries, handshakes still took place.
The Pakistan captain added that he hoped that his team had “saved their best for the final.”
On Friday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military conflict between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
“The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added.
Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four stage match against India, ESPNCricinfo added.
According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson.
Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-27 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271957582dfad3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944999/explainer-what-is-driving-the-fighting-between-israel-and-yemens-houthis' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: What is driving the fighting between Israel and Yemen’s Houthis?</strong></a><br><p>The Houthi rebels, who control swathes of Yemen, have used an array of sophisticated weapons — including ballistic missiles and “kamikaze” drones — in attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea in protest against Israel’s ongoing military onslaught in the Gaza Strip.
Attacks on cargo ships and fuel tankers began in November 2023, when Houthi hijacked the Galaxy Leader cargo vessel as it was passing through the southern Red Sea. They redirected it toward Hodeidah port in Yemen and seized the crew. Since then, at least 43 more ships have been attacked in the area, with four seafarers killed and two vessels sunk.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted international commerce, forcing international shipping to take the long route around South Africa to avoid being struck. Around 12 per cent of shipping passes through the Red Sea and the increase in delivery costs is stoking fears it could trigger a fresh bout of global inflation.
 
 

Recent developments between Tel Aviv and Sanaa include the killing of the Houthi government’s prime minister and several other ministers in an Israeli strike on the Yemeni capital, while the Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel, targeting Tel Aviv and other cities like Eilat, where a Houthi drone wounded 22 people earlier this week.
The Houthis have also hit American vessels during this almost two-year-long period, prompting the United States to launch a series of strikes, the most recent ones being in March.
Who are the Houthis?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in Yemen’s far north set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, which had once ruled the country but whose northern heartland had become impoverished and marginalised. As friction with the government grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Saudi Arabia.
A civil war broke out in late 2014, when Sanaa was seized by the Houthis. Worried by the growing influence of Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia intervened at the head of a Western-backed coalition in March 2015 in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other big population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a UN-led peace push, but the Houthi attacks on Israel have increased the risks of conflict in the country.
Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping
The Houthis say their attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea are a show of solidarity for the Palestinians and Hamas amid the latter’s fighting with Israel.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks on ships off Yemen’s coast, causing traffic passing through the Suez Canal to fall by 75pc in 2024 and increasing transit times by an average of seven to 14 days, according to US-based supply chain management technology company project44.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the US and Britain, shipping industry sources have said all ships were at risk.

A period of relative calm started in January this year alongside the Gaza ceasefire, but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval strikes if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza. They then announced a resumption of attacks with immediate effect on March 12.
The Israeli response
Since November 2023, Israel has intercepted multiple drones and missiles launched from Yemen and also struck Houthi facilities in response.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu detailed Tel Aviv’s military activity over the past year, stating, “We’ve hammered the Houthis.
“So here’s where things stand today: half the Houthi leadership in Yemen [is] gone,“ he said.
Over the past six months alone, Israel has launched devastating strikes on Yemen, targeting Sanaa, Houthi leadership, Houthi-controlled areas, ports and energy facilities. The port of Hodeida — a key entry point for Yemeni aid — has been struck several times over the past year, in April, May, June and July.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed earlier this month to inflict the biblical 10 plagues of Egypt on the Houthis after they stepped up missile attacks against Israel.
The Houthis are firing missiles at Israel again. A plague of darkness, a plague of the firstborn — we will complete all 10 plagues,” Katz posted on X. He was referring to the 10 disasters that the Book of Exodus says were inflicted on Egypt by the Hebrew God to convince the pharaoh to free the enslaved Israelites.
What happens now?
Based on this pattern of tit-for-tat strikes, it is likely that these attacks and interceptions will continue until Israel ceases military operations in Gaza — that have only intensified.
Today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that a liquefied petroleum gas tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month.
Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire.
“The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.</p><small>2025-09-27 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271654283ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944979/security-forces-kill-17-india-sponsored-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 17 ‘India-sponsored’ terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 17 “India-sponsored” terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the IBO on the night between Friday and Saturday, on the “reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the operation, “own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and resultantly, seventeen Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR statement said.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [in the] killing of innocent civilians”.
The statement said a sanitisation operation was being conducted to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khwarji found in the area”.
 






The ISPR also reaffirmed the security forces’ determination to wipe out the menace of “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari has congratulated the security forces on their successful operation in Lakki Marwat, according to a statement issued by his secretariat.
He paid tribute to the courage and sacrifices of the forces, saying “their efforts reflect the nation’s firm resolve to eradicate Indian proxy terrorism from Pakistan”.
“The complete elimination of Fitna al Khwarij and its networks is vital for lasting peace and stability in the country,” he added
President Zardari reaffirmed that the entire nation stands united with its valiant armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
In August, terrorists in Lakki Marwat had carried out a series of militant attacks, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.

The Indian juggernaut has crushed every opposition on their path before swaggering into the final of the eight-team tournament looking every inch the reigning 20-over world champions.
Pakistan were beaten comprehensively twice, first in the group stage and then in Super Fours, by an India team containing the world’s top-ranked batter and bowler in the T20 format in opener Abhishek Sharma and spinner Varun Chakravarthy.
 
 

Six-hitting machine Abhishek is also the tournament’s leading scorer with 309 runs from six innings, often setting the tone of India’s batting in the first six powerplay overs.
In a low-scoring tournament where only Pathum Nissanka of Sri Lanka managed a century, Abhishek’s red-hot form at the top meant skipper Suryakumar Yadav’s struggle with the bat has not really been felt.
Wily seamer Jasprit Bumrah has helped India control the powerplay overs with the ball but left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav has been their wrecker-in-chief leading the bowlers’ chart with 13 wickets.
 


Fellow spinners Axar Patel and Chakravarthy have also kept it tight in the middle overs and the slew of all-rounders at his disposal has left Suryakumar practically spoilt for bowling choices.
Sparks flew and tempers frayed both times India and Pakistan met in what is their first tournament since a military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
India survived a scare in Friday’s dead rubber when they edged out Sri Lanka via Super Over after Sri Lanka managed to tie the match after getting 202 at Dubai. That should shake off any complacency that might have crept into their campaign.
“(I got) what I wanted from the boys — just to try and execute their plans, be clear and not to fear,” Suryakumar said of their flawless campaign heading into the final.
“That was really important, and I am sure everyone got what they wanted. Happy to be in the final.”
Pakistan will naturally be motivated to avoid a third defeat to the arch-rivals in a single tournament and will take heart from their thrilling victory in Thursday’s virtual semi-final against Bangladesh.
 
 

“Very excited,” Pakistan captain Salman Agha said of the final against India.
“We know what we need to do, and we are a good enough team to beat anyone, and we will come on Sunday and try to beat them.”
Ahead of the high-profile clash, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Asian Cricket Council chairman Mohsin Naqvi has stirred up a stirred up a hornet’s nest with an ambiguous post on X about a “balancing act”.
 






“How much time do you need to explain the reasons behind the balancing act?,” he wrote on X, leaving fans pondering if it was intended for the Indian team given its timing.</p><small>2025-09-27 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2717454227c4b28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944978/lpg-tanker-with-24-pakistanis-aboard-attacked-by-israeli-drone-at-yemen-port-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>LPG tanker with 24 Pakistanis aboard attacked by Israeli drone at Yemen port: Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month.
After the Foreign Office (FO) said earlier today that Pakistanis aboard the LPG tanker were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters, Naqvi posted on X that the vessel was attacked on September 17 while it was docked at the Ras Issa port, which was under the control of Houthi rebels.
 






Israel has launched repeated attacks on Houthi targets during the Gaza conflict, as the Iran-backed rebels fire missiles and drones at Israel and Red Sea shipping, claiming solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
According to Naqvi, apart from Pakistanis, the LPG tanker’s crew included two Sri Lankans and a Nepali. He said the vessel’s captain was also a Pakistani.
Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire.
“The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.
Naqvi said he was “profoundly grateful to Secretary Interior Khurram Agha and other MOI (Ministry of Interior) officers, Ambassador Naveed Bokhari and his team in Oman, our colleagues in Saudi Arabia, and especially the officials of our security agencies who worked day and night under extraordinary conditions to secure the safe release of our citizens when hope was fading”.
Earlier, the FO said 24 Pakistani nationals aboard the vessel were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters.
The FO also said that the tanker had caught fire off the coast of Yemen on September 17, adding that upon receiving the news about the incident, the relevant Pakistan embassies had established contacts with the authorities in Yemen to ensure the well-being of the crew.
“Efforts were made to set the tanker underway again,” it added.
The FO further stated that diplomatic missions also maintained contact with the family members of the Pakistani crew and kept them updated about the latest situation.
“Today, the LPG tanker has departed [from the] port and is making [its] way out of Yemeni waters. The entire crew, including Pakistani nationals, on board is safe and sound,” it said.</p><small>2025-09-27 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625810-lpg-tanker-carrying-24-pakistanis-released-by-houthis-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>24 Pakistani hostages, LPG tanker released by Houthis: Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>

The federal government last month informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on September 1.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
According to notifications dated September 25, 2025 and issued by theMinistry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) — copies of which are available with Dawn.com — denotified camps are located in Haripur, Chitral and Upper Dir in KP, Chaghai, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Pishin and Quetta in Balochistan, and Mianwali in Punjab.
When asked about the opinion on denotifying camps where thousands of refugees are staying, the Afghan Chief Commission did not respond to a request for comment.
Haji Abdul Samad, who is representative of a main camp in Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Dawn.com this week that local officials have told him to vacate the camp in accordance with the government’s policy.
He, however, said there has been no raid, arrest or pressure on refugees to leave the Panian camp, which houses about 13,000 families and over 90,000 refugees, according to Abdul Samad.
Chief Minister KP Ali Amin Khan Gandapur stated on a number of occasions that his government will not force refugees to return.
The Safron ministry notifications say all lands within the denotified areas will be handed over to the provincial governments and deputy commissioners of the concerned districts.
They also read that all non-movable assets within the notified area will also be handed over to the provinces and deputy commissioners.
Most of the camps had been set up in early 1980s when refugees started coming to Pakistan after the invasion of the erstwhile Soviet Union.
UNHCR concerned
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, has shown concern at Pakistan’s decision to denotify some of the refugee villages.
It reiterated that returns to Afghanistan should be voluntary, phased, safe and dignified.
“Many of the people affected are Afghan refugees who have lived for years in these villages and have expressed great despair about how this development is going to impact on their lives,” spokesperson for UNHCR Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, told Dawn.com on Saturday.
“In particular, UNHCR urges that people with international protection needs and those with humanitarian considerations face particular challenges and should be protected against (forced) returns,” Afridi said.
Pakistan started repatriation of Afghan refugees in 2023 over security concerns and amid tension with the Taliban government.
Pakistan also argues that war has ended in Afghanistan and refugees should go back.
However, the refugees complain about the lack of transport. They say that they face problems finding trucks for shifting their household goods.
Gada Ali Khan Zadran, a representative of the refugees at Mianwali camp, told Dawn.com that refugees are facing difficulties in finding transport to take household items to Afghanistan.
Zadran also said that the fare of transport has also been increased from Rs300,000 to 600,000.
According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-09-27 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625809-khawaja-asif-says-pakistan-not-selling-nukes-under-saudi-defence-pact' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif says Pakistan not selling nukes under Saudi defence pact</strong></a><br><p>

The first incident, in the Panjgur district, involved a pickup truck laden with fuel and a passenger coach colliding near Panjgur Bazaar, according to Assistant Commissioner Jawad Zehri.
“The crash was so severe that both vehicles immediately erupted into flames,” Zehri said, adding that a passing motorcyclist was also caught in the fiery collision and injured.
“Eight people were burnt alive at the scene of the accident, six of whom were aboard the passenger coach,” he told Dawn.com. “The deceased have been identified; six of them are said to be from Khuzdar and the other two from Panjgur.”
AC Zehri added that the injured motorcyclist, who is in critical condition, has been referred to Karachi for treatment.
“Levies personnel have begun investigating the incident and the bodies of the deceased are being sent to their native areas,” he said.
Meanwhile, three people were killed and five others were injured when a passenger coach collided with a car and overturned in the province’s Pishin district, Karizat Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamza said.
“The coach, travelling from Quetta to Islamabad, collided with a car coming from the opposite direction and overturned,” he told Dawn.com. “Two people were killed at the scene, while six wounded were rushed to a trauma centre.”
Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran told Dawn.com: “The injured were provided immediate medical assistance; however, unfortunately, one of the injured succumbed to their injuries on the way to the hospital.
“Those injured in the accident are being provided treatment on an emergency basis. Under my supervision, the trauma centre’s entire medical team are busy saving the lives of the injured, while two of the injured are in a critical condition.”

Tel Aviv has done again what it does best: attacking unarmed civilians.
Late on Tuesday night, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — was hit by Israeli drones as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza.
The aid boats are carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aim to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide, as classified by the United Nations.

According to a statement issued by the GSF, at least 14 boats were targeted with explosive and incendiary devices while in Greek waters. Emergency communication devices were also disabled and “calculated physical damage designed to render the ships unseaworthy”.
 






Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the flotilla, told Dawn.com that his vessel was safe during the attacks. Recalling that night, he said that around 15 drones carried out 12 strikes.
“They partially damaged around seven or eight of our boats,“ Khan said. “We were able to fix the damage and the boats are still seaworthy.
“They jammed our communication systems, the systems we use to reach out to the international community for help were jammed,” he said.
 
 

Khan stated that Israeli forces used sound bombs, flares and chemical agents to inflict “psychological warfare aimed at instilling fear in the participants”.
The former senator said that the convoy has left Greek waters and is still en route to Gaza, expecting to enter international waters soon. He added that the next two to three days are crucial for the mission.
“We have been travelling non-stop and will enter international waters soon. This stretch is extremely important because the moment we enter international waters, Gaza will be right in front of us.”
Khan revealed that EU states warned of an impending escalation of attacks on the convoy as it neared Gaza.
“An attack on this flotilla would be an act of terrorism,” he stressed. He reiterated that the flotilla’s mission is peaceful and its goal is to break the blockade and deliver life-saving humanitarian aid.
Two days prior to the attack, the Israeli foreign ministry’s account on X posted a lengthy statement in which it slapped the ‘Hamas’ label on the flotilla convoy and asserted that it “will not allow the breach of a ‘lawful’ naval blockade”.
Moreover, it suggested unloading the aid at Israel’s Ashkelon Marina port from where it would supposedly be delivered to the very enclave Israeli forces are starving and continuously bombing.
 






When asked about the flotilla being labelled a part of Hamas by Tel Aviv, the former senator dismissed it as propaganda.
“They have threatened us and attacked us, but people are now seeing Israel’s true face,” he replied. “Are these activists, actors and lawmakers terrorists?”
Italy, which has stated its intention to recognise a Palestinian state — on the condition that all hostages are released and that Hamas is excluded, as outlined by its Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has not only condemned the attack but has dispatched two navy ships to assist the flotilla.

Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stated last Thursday that the country had sent two of their naval vessels to assist the Italian participants on the GSF.
“It is not an act of war, it is not a provocation: it is an act of humanity, which is a duty of a state towards its citizens,” he told the upper house of parliament. Following Italy’s lead, Spain announced that it has deployed a navy warship to help the aid convoy.
However, Khan made it clear that these vessels are “not for action”, but rather for relief and rescue.
According to the GSF, “hundreds of elected representatives from across the EU” have demanded the immediate protection of the Global Sumud Flotilla. The coalition also posted the penned appeal to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on their Instagram platform.
Using Italy and Spain as an example, Khan called on the Pakistani government to take action and aid the flotilla.
“No official has reached out, nor have they raised this at international fora like the UN and the OIC,” he lamented.
“The Pakistan government should state their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and should condemn the attack. Like Italy and Spain who have sent their navy ships, Pakistan should dispatch a mission. If they cannot send navy ships then they should send a civilian humanitarian mission, something like Rescue 1122, so it can help in rescue efforts,” he stressed.
 






During his conversation with Dawn.com, Khan noted that parliament also has a role to play in raising its voice against the attack.
“Pakistan’s parliament and parliamentarians should also play their part.”
On September 19, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement calling attention to the GSF and highlighting Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s concerns about its safety.
The statement read that FM Dar, along with his counterparts from Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mexico, Oman, Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain and Turkiye, expressed concerns about the security of the flotilla.
“We therefore call on everyone to refrain from any unlawful or violent act against the flotilla, to respect international law and international humanitarian law,” the FO said.
Replying to a question about nations recognising a Palestinian state, the ex-senator expressed displeasure with the fact that European nations are recognising the state according to the 1967 borders and excluding Hamas from the governance process.
 
 

“They are not recognising the state according to the 1948 borders, but those from 1967,” he explained. “In doing so, they are ignoring the government, currency and other aspects of the state from that time.
“Hamas is a governing entity which won an election. I demand that Israel grant Palestinians political independence.”
Meanwhile, the Israeli foreign ministry account on X posted another proposal, this time to unload the aid at any country outside Israel.
“If this is not about provocation and serving Hamas, you are welcome to unload any aid you might have at any port in a nearby country outside Israel,” the post read.
Resorting to threats is all Israel seems to know, as the post ends with the question of whether the GSF’s humanitarian mission is about “aid or provocation“.
According to Reuters, Italy suggested that the GSF could leave the aid at Cyprus and that it would then be handed to the Catholic Church’s Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, who would then distribute it in Gaza.
Reacting to their country’s recommendation, Italian volunteers on the GSF categorically rejected the notion of dropping aid in Cyprus.
The Italian group, in a statement, said that their mission stays “true to its original goal of breaking [Israel’s] illegal siege and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza.”
Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar accused the participants of the GSF by stating that their rejection of Italy’s compromise was supposed proof that “their real purpose is provocation and serving Hamas“.
 






Israel seems to think it owns the seas and can do what it likes without consequence, including attacking humanitarian vessels on international waters.
In the backdrop of the 80th UNGA, the apartheid state continues to bomb Gaza and extend its aggression to those trying to address the plight of its civilian population.

The latest attack on the flotilla is the third of its kind; however, this time, Israel has faced condemnation for the attack. The first two strikes, which took place on September 10 and 11 in Tunisian waters, targeted the ‘Family’ and ‘Alma’ boats.
Footage of incendiary devices striking the boats was circulated on social media with calls for an investigation. Tunisian authorities, however, denied that any foreign device had intercepted their airspace.
On Friday, Kieran Andrieu — one of the participants on the ‘Family’ boat — said in a video message that the vessel had been decommissioned due to engine failure and would not sail to Gaza.
“The good news is that there are enough spaces on all of the other boats for people to be reallocated, so we are waiting to hear about reallocation and about who’s going where,” he said.
 






Echoing the sentiments of all the participants on the flotilla, the former JI senator placed emphasis on the commitment to reach Gaza and distribute humanitarian aid.
“We will not stop, we will reach Gaza under any circumstance. We will deliver humanitarian aid, we will break the siege and we will stand against genocide. This is our commitment.”

The protest was launched in July against the government’s taxation policies and suspension of customs clearance at the port.
Trade leader Javed Hussain, who led the protest, told Dawn.com, that the announcement about traders ending the protest ending was made by the supreme council — a body that had represented the them in talks with the federal and GB government.
Following the negotiations, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari had announced on Wednesday that the government had agreed to tax exemptions on imports coming through the Sost Dry Port — provided that the goods were for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions. The total annual value of tax exemptions was capped at Rs4 billion.
However, expressing dissatisfaction over the negotiations’ results, GB traders had decided to continue to the sit-in and hold a meeting with the supreme council.
Hussain said the traders had ended their sit-in on the suggestion of the council but, at the same time, he expressed reservations on the decision.
He maintained that the decisions taken during negotiations with the government were not completely in line with their demands.
Separately, trade leader Rehan Shah shared with Dawn.com that the protesting traders had held a meeting with the supreme council last night, during which the sit-in and the agreement reached with the government were discussed.
Shah added it was decided that containers stuck at the Sost Dry Port for the past two years would be cleared in the next two days and a statutory regulatory order (SRO) would be issued within a month, which he said would be the practical implementation of the traders’ demands. He added the supreme council and traders would hold another meeting to decide the future plan of action when the SRO was issued or even if its issuance was delayed.
Earlier, a committee constituted by the GB chief minister had suggested that a special consolidated SRO should be introduced to grant tax exemption for GB.</p><small>2025-09-27 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625795-security-forces-kill-17-indian-sponsored-terrorists-in-karak-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 17 Indian-sponsored terrorists in Lakki Marwat IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

His came after the two leaders had their first formal bilateral interaction at the Oval Office in Washington on Thursday. During the meeting, they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters.
The premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
 
 

The meeting itself was closed to the press — a break from President Trump’s usual modus operandi — as he is quite fond of Oval Office photo-ops and there was no press conference either; just a statement issued from Pakistan where the US president was described as a “man of peace” and stressing the need to enhance cooperation in security and intelligence.
During an interaction with the media in New Jersey, which was aired on Geo News on Saturday morning, the premier said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. The PM added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.
“We have signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with one of their delegations,” he said, without sharing any further details.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan’s economy has “stabilised at the macro level” and also credited overseas Pakistanis for their contributions and efforts. “No amount of gratitude is enough,” he said.
The premier also hailed Field Marshal Asim Munir for leading the nation “from the front” during a four-day military encounter between Pakistan in India in May.
“He led Pakistan with courage, boldness, and intelligence,” the PM said.
Soon after the escalation, Pakistan had said it had downed six Indian jets. However, the PM said on Friday that the number of downed Indian jets was seven.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625778-lawyers-cannot-dictate-court-proceedings-rules-shc-in-justice-jehangiri-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers cannot dictate court proceedings, rules SHC in Justice Jahangiri degree case</strong></a><br><p>

Asif made the remarks during an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan for Zeteo. The full interview is behind a paywall but the media company has shared a five-minute preview as well as clips on social media.
On September 17, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also comes just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
Previously, Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework. However, in a subsequent interview the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
In the preview posted on Zeteo’s website on Friday night, Hasan asked Asif about the defence pact.
“How much of it is a reaction to the Israeli bombing of Qatar?” he asked.
“It is not a reaction to what happened in Qatar because this was being negotiated for quite some time. So it’s not a reaction; perhaps it must have sped it up a bit but that is all. It was already in the offing,“ Asif replied.
Hasan then pointed out that Pakistan was the only nuclear power in the Muslim world, noting that Saudi Arabia had expressed interest in being the second. He also pointed out that Asif had previously stated that nuclear weapons “were not on the radar” for this pact.
“Is Saudi Arabia protected by Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella per this agreement or not?” he asked.
“We have had a very long defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, spanning five or six decades. We had a military presence over there, perhaps more than four or five thousand at the peak and we still have military presence over there. I think we have just formalised that relationship which was previously a bit transactional,” Asif responded.
“Formalised with or without the nukes?” Hasan probed.
However, the minister refrained from going into the details.
“I will refrain from going into the details but it’s a defence pact and defence pacts are normally not discussed publicly,” he said.
Hasan then pointed out that journalist Bob Woodward, in his 2024 book War, had quoted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman telling a US senator that he could “just buy” a bomb from Pakistan.
“I think that is just sensationalised […] No, I don’t believe that quote,” the minister replied.
“So you are not in the business of selling nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia?”
“No. We are very responsible people,” Asif responded.
Pak-China ties
In a separate video shared on Instagram, Hasan asked the minister whether Pakistan’s now close relationship with the United States could jeapardise its vital relationship with China.
“Obviously, America and China are at loggerheads,” he said.
“No, we are not worried about that because it’s a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s,” Asif replied.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

When probed further about Pakistan “flirting” with the US, the minister said that China was not worried in this regard.
“Is your strategic future with China or with the US? It can’t be both,” Hasan pointed out.
The minister responded by saying that China had been a “very reliable ally” for Pakistan.
“A major portion of our arms are from China. And our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before,” he said, adding that this was due to the “unreliability of other sources, like the US”.
“So are you basically saying that your strategic future is with China, not the US?” Hasan asked.
“Yeah […] they are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share geography,” the minister said.
Imran Khan’s arrest
In another clip posted on Instagram, Hasan asked about incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and asked why he had been arrested.
“That’s the problem with Pakistan: you all imprison each other every time you come into power […] If it was unjust to you, isn’t it unjust to Imran?” he asked.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The minister asserted that it was not a tit-for-tat measure.
However, Hasan then pointed out Amnesty International had released a report on Imran’s arrest while a United Nations group had said that there was no legal basis for Imran’s imprisonment and termed it arbitrary.
“Well, I think they have an opinion with which I disagree,” Asif responded.
“Their opinion is that you are breaking the law,” Hasan said.
“No, we aren’t breaking the law,” Asif asserted.
“Pakistan has a situation whereby we are trying to recover from a very, very — misrule or bad rule or whatever you can call it —  for three-and-a-half years,” the minister said.
He also further said that whole families were arrested during Imran’s tenure.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27141142a176ade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944972/new-drone-sightings-over-denmarks-biggest-military-base' target='_blank'><strong>New drone sightings over Denmark’s biggest military base</strong></a><br><p>Unidentified drones were observed during the night over Denmark’s biggest military base, police said on Saturday, the latest in a slew of sightings that Danish officials have called a “hybrid attack”.
The mystery drone observations have prompted the closure of several airports across the Scandinavian country since Monday, when the first drones appeared.
“I can confirm that we had an incident around 8:15pm (11:15pm PKT) that lasted for some hours. One to two drones were observed outside and over the airbase,” duty officer Simon Skelsjaer told AFP, referring to the Karup military base.
He said police could not comment on where the drones came from, adding: “We didn’t take them down.”
Police were cooperating with the military in their investigation, he said.
The Karup base shares its runways with the Midtjylland civilian airport, which was briefly closed though no flights were affected as no commercial flights were scheduled at that hour, Skelsjaer said.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that “over recent days, Denmark has been the victim of hybrid attacks,” referring to unconventional warfare.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625780-foreign-affairs-ministry-had-no-role' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office denies role in Shama Junejo's presence in UN delegation</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting occurred on the sidelines of the 80th session of the UNGA in New York. A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had addressed the session, highlighting the need for “proactive” leadership for South Asia and expressing support for Gaza.
In a statement on X, the Foreign Office said that Dar and Baerbock “exchanged views on key regional and international issues, including [the] Palestine issue and the urgent need for UN reforms, including UN Security Council reforms”.
Dar reaffirmed commitment to regional and global peace and stability and called for the just resolution of the Kashmir dispute per UNSC resolutions, it added.
 






Separately, the foreign minister held meetings with his counterparts from various countries, including Malaysia and Morocco.
Dar met Malaysian FM Dato Seri Utama Mohamad Hasan, where both leaders agreed to review the bilateral economy and global issues in Kuala Lumpur in early October.
“Pakistan and Malaysia continue to work together to advance our partnership, both bilaterally and at multilateral fora,” he said in a post on X.
“We agreed to review our mutual economic agenda and current global issues in Kuala Lumpur in early October 2025,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the FO said that Dar also met with Morocco’s Nasser Bourita, noting, “both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity, and regional peace.”
“They also reaffirmed their shared commitment to deepening Pakistan–Morocco relations and further strengthening collaboration at multilateral fora,” it wrote on X.

The fire is suspected to have started with an explosion on Friday night of the battery produced by South Korea’s LG Energy Solution during maintenance, damaging some servers and forcing the shutdown of hundreds of others, officials said.
The fire led to a “thermal runaway”, producing extreme heat in the server room at the National Information Resources Services in the city of Daejeon, preventing firefighters from taking aggressive actions to contain the blaze, fire and government officials said in press briefings.
The national data service acts as a cloud server for many government services and databases for the heavily wired Asian country. It operates data centres in other locations.
The fire, which began around 8:20pm (4:20pm PKT), was brought under control early on Saturday, but more than 600 servers remained in forced shutdown to protect data while firefighters worked to extract nearly 400 battery packs from the building as safety measures, officials said.
The cause of the initial spark was not known and was under investigation, they said.
LG Energy Solution declined to comment as the case is under investigation.
Some government ministries, the mobile identification system, the postal service, and the government legal database were among websites that remained down on Saturday after the fire in Daejeon, about 140 km (90 miles) from the capital Seoul.
Some ministries are unable to use email, according to notices to reporters.
Prime Minister Kim Min-seok apologised on Saturday for the inconvenience to the public from disrupted services and said the government would work swiftly to restore services. In the meantime, tax payment deadlines coming soon would be delayed, he said.
“There were difficulties in containing the fire because of the nature of critical government systems being concentrated at one site,” Kim told a televised emergency meeting.
The internal networks of some government agencies in Daejeon and nearby Sejong were “paralysed”, Kim said. There was no estimate for when services would restart, the head of the data centre, Lee Jae-yong, told a briefing.
One person has been treated for a minor injury, a fire official told another press briefing. There was considerable fire damage at the location of the initial blaze on the fifth floor of the building, fire official Kim Ki-seon said.</p><small>2025-09-27 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271146074142095.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944873/quadripartite-moot-urges-kabul-to-counter-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Quadripartite moot urges Kabul to counter terrorism</strong></a><br><p>NEW YORK: The foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, in a joint statement, have urged Afghan­istan to take “effective, concrete, and verifiable actions” to dismantle terrorist groups operating from its territory.
The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil.
The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan.
They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.”
 






The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”.
The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan.
 
 

The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions.
They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution.
They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains, the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m.
More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala.
 
 

The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts.
Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes.
According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes.
Health facilities
A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara.
In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed.
By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability.
 
 

The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases.
Educational institutions
According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools.
Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15).
Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur.
 
 

Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal.
Livestock
Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity.
Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days.
Ex-gratia assistance
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion.
The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded.
The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued.
The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

The direction came after the federal government transferred Rs5 million into the account of Abdullah’s family. During the hearing, Additional Attorney General and officials of the defence ministry presented the receipt of the online transfer before the court.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, while addressing the victim’s father, remarked that the family would receive the money by tomorrow, but added that compensation could not heal the trauma caused by enforced disappearances. “This money cannot cure the family’s suffering,” the judge observed.
He further warned that the matter could lead to criminal proceedings at any stage, criticising parliament for its silence on the issue. 
“This is the work of parliament, but unfortunately they have closed their eyes,” he remarked.
Justice Kayani stressed that the court wanted only the truth about Abdullah’s fate. “We should be told whether the missing citizen is alive, dead, or in an Afghan jail. Officers should just come with the record and inform the court of the facts — we are not writing anyone’s name in the verdict,” he said.
The judge noted that intelligence officers regularly appeared before the Missing Persons Commission but expressed reluctance when summoned by courts. “I do not know why they get so angry with the court while the same officers appear before a retired judge in the commission,” he added.
He further observed that financial settlements could not resolve the longstanding issue of enforced disappearances.
“The state does not have a shortage of money, but the problem will not be solved by paying money. 
The court should be informed whether the person was killed, left the country or is hiding somewhere,” Justice Kayani remarked.
Lamenting the lack of progress over the past decade, the judge said no authority had so far provided the courts with the truth. 
“Brigadier Sahib! We cannot tear up judgments, you have to tell us where the missing person is,” he said, while reminding the defence ministry’s representative that the family was not at fault and everything should be handled in accordance with the law to maintain public trust.
The court adjourned the hearing until Oct 6, directing the ministry to inform it beforehand which officer would appear for the in-camera briefing.

On September 25, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had addressed a UNSC session on artificial intelligence. However, photos from his speech had spread like wildfire on social media platform X as users had pointed to Junejo sitting in the background and shared several screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel.
Following the social media furore, Asif clarified that he had given the speech instead of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the latter had other engagements; the premier has been attending the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said.
The defence minister said that for the past 60 years, he had an emotional attachment and personal commitment to the Palestine cause. He added that he had Palestinian friends and colleagues while working in Abu Dhabi and was still in contact with them.
 






“My views on Gaza are clear and I express them openly,” he said, expressing his hatred for Israel and Zionism.
“Who is this woman, why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf,” Asif said.
He said that his account on X was a testament to the fact that his relationship with Palestine was part of his faith.
Subsequently, in a post on X late on Friday night, the FO said that it had noted the queries regarding “the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC”. The FO did not explicitly name Junejo.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” it said.
“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/foreign minister,” it added.
 






Meanwhile, Junejo also took to X and posted screenshots of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
 






“Youthias are calling me a Zionist when for the past two years I have tweeted about Gaza almost daily, calling [Israeli PM] Netanyahu a war criminal and showing Israeli atrocities,” she said.
The term “youthia” is a derogatory term commonly used as a slur for PTI supporters.
“Once again, this entire campaign has been launched against me because they only fear me,” she said.
Uproar
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari had stated that one could not sit behind a minister in the UNSC or the United Nations General Assembly unless they were identified as an official representative of the government.
“So who allowed this to happen and why? Is there a covert policy agenda at work viz rogue entity Israel, Bagram base, Abraham Accords? GoP needs to come clean — who is responsible?” she asked.
 






Mehlaqa Samdani, the director of the Community Alliance For Peace and Justice, said: “To include Shama Junejo, who champions a pro-Israel and pro-normalisation agenda, in Pakistan’s #UNGA delegation is not a good look for Pakistan.”
 






Meanwhile, journalist Ahmad Noorani said that questioning Junejo’s patriotism or “branding her ‘pro-Israel’ over her views on diplomacy is disgraceful”.
“This vile smear campaign is being pushed by dirty-minded trolls,” he said.

He also denounced several Western countries for embracing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of pushing his country into “national suicide”.
The Israeli leader, who has an International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes, addressed mostly empty chairs in the UN General Assembly, as scores of delegates — including the Pakistan contingent — walked out when he took the stage.
At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic near Times Square in New York to protest the killing of more than 65,000 people in Gaza by Israeli strikes in less than two years.

“War criminals don’t deserve any peace of mind. They don’t deserve any sleep,” said Andrea Mirez, a young woman who kept up an overnight noisy protest outside Netanyahu’s hotel.
In his speech, days after France, Britain and other Western powers amid worldwide protests against the ongoing war on Gaza recognised the state of Palestine, he showed a map of the Middle East, taking out a pen to cross out adversaries Israel has killed. He also vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, even as President Donald Trump said he thought he had sealed a deal on a ceasefire.
 
 

A senior White House official told Reuters that Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday in Washington with the aim of reaching a framework for a deal.
In his speech, Netanyahu claimed that over time, many world leaders buckled. “They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies and antisemitic mobs… Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals,” he claimed.
However, he did not touch on the issue of annexing the occupied West Bank.

Response to speech
Gaza authorities described Netanyahu’s speech as one “filled with lies and blatant contradictions” and condemned it as a “desperate attempt to justify the war crimes and acts of genocide.”
“Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement.
Also, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, earlier speaking by video after the US denied him a visa, condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a war of genocide”. He thanked the countries that recognised Palestinian statehood, pledged that Palestinian Authority would be ready to govern post-war Gaza.
New coalition to back Palestine
On the other hand, 12 countries — Britain, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland — announced a new coalition to financially support the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority as Israel withheld tax revenues of Palestinian Authority for past two years.
The Emergency Coalition for the Financial Sustainability of the Palestinian Authority “was established in response to the urgent and unprecedented financial crisis” confronting the PA, the Spanish foreign ministry said.
It aims to stabilise the Ramallah-based body’s finances, preserve its ability to govern, provide essential services and maintain security, “all of which are indispensable to regional stability and to preserving the two-state solution”, the statement added.

It was not clear why Hegseth has ordered the generals and admirals to meet in one place on such short notice, and two of the officials said this has created uncertainty among the expected attendees.
Senior military officials in some cases command thousands of troops. Most have detailed schedules weeks in advance, which have now been upended.
“People are scrambling to change their plans and see if they have to attend,” one US official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
It was unclear how many officials will actually attend the event, but it is rare to have so many senior officials in the same room at the same time.
Asked for comment, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said only: “The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.”
Trump has ordered the department to rename itself the Department of War, a change that will require action by Congress.
Parnell’s office did not respond to questions about the number of officers, purpose of the meeting or why Hegseth called so abruptly. However, at the White House, US Vice President J.D. Vance claimed that such a meeting was “not unusual at all.”
The US has troops around the world, including in distant locations like South Korea, Japan and across the Middle East, which are commanded by two, three and four-star generals and admirals.
“It’s probably more mundane than people think… (but) the lack of clarity isn’t helping,” the official said.

It said less than two months after a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court acquitted Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, the Indian Army has promoted him to the rank of Colonel. Purohit, one of seven accused tried for their roles in the terror blasts, alongside former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Pragya Singh Thakur, was acquitted after the prosecution failed to prove the case in court.
Special Judge A.K. Lahoti, while acquitting the seven accused, pointed to “grave suspicion” against them but added that “a grave degree of suspicion is established, but not enough to convict the accused persons. Hence, the court has given them the benefit of doubt”. Judge Lahoti further stated, “There can be strong suspicion, but mere suspicion is not enough to punish them”.
The NIA, which claimed it would seek legal opinion to decide whether to challenge the acquittal in the Bombay High Court, has shown no commitment to pursuing the case further. Meanwhile, the families of the six individuals killed in the blast have challenged the acquittal, The Wire said.
Speaking to the media, Purohit’s wife, Aparna, confirmed the promotion. This promotion can be interpreted as a clear stand by the government in support of an individual who was a terror accused for over 17 years.
Minister of Textile Giriraj Singh shared a picture of the pipping ceremony of Purohit and congratulated him. “Congratulations Col. Purohit on being back in uniform. The Govt (government) stands firmly with patriots who serve the nation with courage and integrity,” Singh wrote.
 
 

A serving army officer, Purohit’s arrest in 2008 was considered key in establishing the “motive” behind the blast. The case was initially handled by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and was later taken over by the NIA after its inception in 2009.
According to the ATS, Purohit founded the Abhinav Bharat organisation in 2006, through which funds were allegedly collected and the conspiracy planned. The ATS claimed that Purohit, through this organisation, aimed to establish a “Hindu Rashtra [nation]” with its own constitution, flag, and “government in exile” to be operated from either Israel or Thailand.
The ATS also claimed to have established financial links and invoked sections of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) to investigate pecuniary activities in the case. While the MCOCA charges were dropped in the initial stage of the trial, Purohit and the other accused faced trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

For the national side’s head coach Mike Hesson, whose credentials were questioned after India outplayed them in the group-stage and Super Four clashes, Pakistan deserved to be in the final after beating all of their opponents through the course of the tournament apart from the archrivals.
 
 

And it’s India only, who’ll be in Pakistan’s way to their Asia Cup title ambition come Sunday.
“We’ve deserved this opportunity, and now it’s up to us to make the most of it,” Hesson told reporters on Thursday night. “All the games before this were about getting into a position to win the trophy.
“We know that the only match that really counts is the final, and that’s our focus, to play our best game when it matters.”
Coming into the Asia Cup after a tri-nation series victory, Pakistan somewhat comfortably beat Oman and hosts United Arab Emirates, with their seven-wicket loss against India coming in between the two fixtures.
Pakistan’s Super Four stage, meanwhile, started with a six-wicket loss against Suryakumar Yadav’s men — the national side performing slightly better with the bat this time — before they went on to edge Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
The two losses seem to have given Pakistan enough information to work with as they prepare for the final — the first time the teams from the neighbouring countries meet in the Asia Cup 41-year history.
“The way we played against India in the last match was a huge step up from the first game,” Hesson noted. “In the first one, we were a bit passive and allowed India to control the game. But in the last match, we had the game by the scruff of the neck for long periods, and it took an exceptional innings from Abhishek Sharma to take it away from us.
“Outside of that, we were pretty good. It was mainly the power play with the ball. We have to be good enough to put them under pressure for longer periods. We did it for about 10 overs with the bat and after the powerplay with the ball, but we need to sustain it longer. There’s a reason they’re rated the top side in the world. That’ll be our challenge.”
And the challenge will be huge, given how Pakistan struggled with the bat against Bangladesh. They were reeling at 46-4 at the end of the powerplay before a fightback of sorts dragged them to 135-8.
Hesson admitted Pakistan were yet to “play the perfect game”.
“Look, I think whenever you get to different phases of the tournament, your opposition often doesn’t allow you to play the perfect game, and we were far from perfect,” the coach observed. “We realized that in the first 10 overs.
“… but the fact we can win games from that position just shows the character in the group. Today, whenever we tried to play aggressively, we got out before getting used to the pitch. These are lessons, and as pitches tire, discipline becomes even more important.”
Hesson, however, was wary that the final against India will have a lot to do with the players’ mindsets.
“We’ve been talking about focusing on the present and not getting ahead of ourselves,” he said. “The boys always aimed to be in this final, and we had to play good cricket to get here.
“We’ve beaten teams we hadn’t beaten in a long time, and we won the tri-series before this. There’s confidence in the group, and wins like today — when everyone writes you off 10 overs in — only build that confidence further.”

Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail-led subcommittee met on Friday with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq H. Naek from the treasury benches and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar from the opposition in attendance.
The JCP subcommittee decided to consolidate and circulate each suggestion among all members for discussion at the next meeting, scheduled for the coming week and postponed proceedings, with an understanding to thoroughly discuss draft suggestions on framing benchmarks to assess judicial performance of sitting judges of the high courts.
One of the proposals was to consider the time period within which a judgement is delivered after it has been reserved by a high court judge, since inordinate delays ultimately frustrate litigants.

Members put forward suggestions, to be consolidated for discussion next week

The committee also suggested making it obligatory for high court judges to pronounce judgements within three months, as held in 2015 Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd case by a three-judge Supreme Court bench.
Presided over by Justice Saqib Nisar, the apex court in its ruling had held that a reasonable time for the pronouncement of judgements should be 90 days, since the enunciation of law requires considerable research, reflection and deliberation.
Ninety days, it noted, should be adequate for composition of judgements. If judges are unable to deliver judgements within this time period, they must record sufficient reasons and may order the case to be reheard.
Number of cases
Another proposal under consideration was for the JCP to evaluate how many cases a judge decides in a month, and whether those decisions involve substantive matters that advance jurisprudence or merely routine bail matters.
The proposals also included assessing whether a judge exhausts the entire cause list for the day or merely hears a few cases and adjourns the rest.
However, questions remain about how benchmarks will account for cases withdrawn after judges point out jurisdictional flaws. A legal expert, noted that such withdrawals save judicial time by avoiding unnecessary appeals, yet they are never reported in law digests. “Should a judge be penalised for thoroughly understanding the case and prompting withdrawal?” the expert asked.
The expert further explained that performance cannot simply be measured by the number of cases heard in a day, as much depends on the type of cases assigned by the chief justice. For example, civil revision cases are time-consuming and complex, whereas other categories may involve issuing directions to departments and can be decided more quickly. Comparing judges across such different case types would be unfair, he argued.
 
 

On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee on judicial performance evaluation of high court judges. The committee, comprising members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and legal fraternity, was tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations and developing criteria for the selection of judges.
The 26th Amendment to Article 175A allows the JCP to give underperforming high court judges time to improve, and if they fail, recommend their removal to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
And after the completion of the period so granted, the performance of the judge is again found to be inefficient; the commission will send its report to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with a recommendation to remove the judge.
Moreover, the commission will hold annual evaluations of high court judges and may set rules to define performance standards.

Justice Raheel Kamran, delivering a detailed 20-page judgement, observed that the ordinance was enacted in a pre-digital era to regulate films exhibited through cinematographs in cinemas and other public venues, and was not designed for online streaming services.
The petitioners, including NC Entertainment (Pvt) Ltd, had argued that requiring cinemas to obtain film certification while leaving digital platforms unregulated was discriminatory and infringed their fundamental rights.
They contended that censorship principles under Section 6 of the Ordinance, derived from Article 19 of the Constitution, should apply equally across all platforms to uphold social norms of decency and morality.

Says extending Motion Pictures Ordinance to streaming services will be ‘judicial legislation’

The counsel argued that provisions of the ordinance had not been enforced equally against all mediums and platforms of public and private exhibition and the same were being applied selectively and arbitrarily against the petitioners, leaving all other digital platforms to continue unchecked.
A law officer for the federal government opposed the writ petitions as not maintainable.
He said the petitioners were not aggrieved and none of their established rights had been restricted or hindered by any of the respondents.
He maintained that following the 18th constitutional amendment, the subject of cinematograph censorship devolved upon the provinces, granting them exclusive authority in this regard.
He contended that the term “cinematograph” shall be construed keeping in view the context of the ordinance and OTT platforms were not covered by it.
A law officer for the Punjab government stated that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) exclusively deals with electronic media and that the jurisdiction of the Punjab Film Censor Board was only restricted to the censorship of films.
He also emphasised that the term “cinematograph” was to be construed in the context of the ordinance, which had no application to the OTT platforms.
A lawyer for Pemra argued that the body was a regulatory authority for the broadcasting media and distribution of services and it was responsible only for improving the quality standards of the channels shown to the people of Pakistan.
He contended that Pemra had no nexus with the motion picture law and the petitioners. He also questioned the locus standi of the petitioners.
A counsel for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) also stated that it had no mandate or jurisdiction to regulate matters pertaining to content that was available for viewership on OTT platforms.
Advocate Zeeshan Zafar Hashmi, an amicus curiae (an impartial adviser to a court of law), also stated that the ordinance essentially deals with the exhibition of films by means of cinematograph, which is controlled by the Censor Board through censorship.
Justice Kamran observed that OTT platforms, which operate globally and deliver content directly to users on personal devices, fall outside the framework of the ordinance.
The judge noted that pre-censorship of OTT platforms was not only legally untenable but also logistically impossible given the vast, continuously updated nature of digital content.
 
 

Justice Kamran ruled that extending the motion pictures ordinance to cover OTT platforms would amount to judicial legislation, which is beyond the court’s domain.
The judge observed that cinemas and OTT platforms are fundamentally distinct and therefore not “similarly circumstanced” entities under Article 25 of the Constitution.
The judge also dismissed the petitioners’ contention that importing digital content is exempt from the Import Policy Order 2022, holding that once content is exhibited publicly in Pakistan, it must comply with domestic laws governing public exhibition.
Justice Kamran then dismissed the petitions, declaring that they were not maintainable on legal or practical grounds.

• FBR analysis points to widespread reluctance in voluntary asset valuation
ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic U-turn, the government on Friday scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
The lightning-fast reversal, prompted by criticism from tax practitioners, lawyers and other groups, has reignited debate over policy consistency and digital reforms aimed at documenting the cash economy.
The income tax return form for 2025, released on July 7, had required taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form. Since then, taxpayers had been submitting returns with the flexibility to either declare the estimated market value of their assets or enter zero in the designated column.
This practice continued even as nearly 2.7 million taxpayers filed their returns under the same arrangement. However, internal analysis by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) revealed a widespread reluctance to voluntarily declare market values.
In response, the FBR introduced a technical adjustment to the system, eliminating the option to enter zero and effectively making it mandatory for all filers to disclose a fair estimate of their asset values. This move triggered strong resistance from multiple quarters, highlighting persistent reluctance to support the formal documentation of the country’s largely cash-driven economy.
On Thursday, the FBR issued a strongly worded clarification, urging taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets in good faith. It assured filers that such disclosures would not be used as grounds for additional taxation and that no supplementary documentation would be required for verification, nor would tax notices be issued solely on the basis of declared asset values.
Despite these assurances, the controversy persisted. In response, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
 
 

The committee was tas­ked with evaluating the implications of the provision for taxpayers and recommending corrective measures to ensure clarity, fairness and administrative feasibility.
On Friday, the committee held consultations with top tax officers to assess the legal aspect of the column.
“The requirement to declare the true market value of assets is firmly embedded in the income tax law,” a senior tax official said, adding that many taxpayers were reluctant to disclose the actual value of their assets, reflecting broader resistance to financial transparency.
Following deliberations, the committee decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister, an FBR announcement said.
The committee included the federal minister for petroleum, the minister of state for finance, the attorney general for Pakistan, the special assistant to the prime minister on coordination, the finance secretary, the FBR chairman and its member customs.
After detailed discussions in its meeting on Friday, the committee recommended that the new column requiring taxpayers to declare estimated fair market values of their assets be withdrawn in the interest of simplifying the filing process.
The recommendation was submitted to the prime minister, who approved it.
According to the statement, in line with the premier’s directives and considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, the “Estimated Fair Market Value” column has been removed from the income tax return form.
It clarified that the column had been introduced solely for data collection to support the Economic Survey and had no bearing on the assessment of income or tax liability.
The FBR reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating taxpayers and urged all eligible individuals to file their returns accurately and in good faith before the Sept 30, 2025, deadline.
