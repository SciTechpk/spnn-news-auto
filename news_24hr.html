“Whether it’s the laptops or the 1,000 students trained in agriculture, or even the 600 students I sent to China during my tenure as the chief minister of Punjab, it is my firm belief that Pakistan’s development does not rely on any single province. It depends on holistic development,” he said at a ceremony at the University of Haripur, where he distributed 500 laptops among students of different universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On the occasion, PM She­h­baz shared his vision of empowering Pakistan’s you­th, stressing the importance of providing them with opportunities based on their capabilities to gain global recognition. “The future of this nation lies in the hands of our students, who are not just bri­l­liant but capable enough to conquer the world,” he said.
The prime minister also honoured the people of KP and the Hazara division for their resilience in the face of terrorism and ongoing security challenges. He paid tribute to the police, law enforcement agencies and the armed forces for their sacrifices in securing the nation.
During his address, the prime minister also referred to the May conflict with India, saying New Delhi would not forget the setback it faced at the hands of Pak­i­s­tan’s armed forces during “Marka-i-Haq”.
“That was a punch in the face for Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said, while praising the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as brave and patriotic. He said the province’s people, along with civil and military forces, had made unforgettable sacrifices for the country.
Economic challenges
The prime minister also shed light on other challenges facing the nation, particularly the state of the economy and the need for skill development. He touched upon the importance of modern skills in sectors like IT, agriculture and mining, stressing the need to bridge the gap between the youth’s capabilities and the industry’s demands.
“We have pulled the economy back from the brink of default, and now it is time to boost growth,” he said, adding that the government planned to send delegations from all provinces to China for training in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.
Earlier, newly elected MNA from Haripur Babar Nawaz highlighted the issues faced by the constituency, particularly in education and development. He said many girls were unable to pursue higher education in co-educational institutions due to cultural constraints and requested the establishment of a women’s campus at Haripur University.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam also addressed the ceremony and praised the prime minister’s outreach to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Hazara, saying the region valued the government’s initiatives.

Three ruling coalition partners — Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) — as well as Awami National Party (ANP) approached the BHC, requesting that the upcoming Quetta Metropolitan Corporation and District Council Quetta elections should be postponed due to harsh cold weather, issues related to voters lists and non-completion of limitation of constituencies.

 

The parties also expressed their apprehensions regarding law and order situation.
While PML-N leader Younis Baloch claimed that the petitions were filed by PPP, PML-N, BAP and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), the latter denied his claim. “Our party has launched a full campaign in favour of its candidates fielded for contesting the election,” Faysal Kakar, spokesman for the party, told Dawn.

Also, the provincial president of Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party (PkNAP) Nasrullah Zerey denied the filing of a petition for election postponement.
However, the parliamentary leader of ANP in Balochistan Assembly, Zamarak Khan Piralizai, confirmed to Dawn that his party did file a petition for the postponement of Local bodies’ election in Quetta district.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti earlier opposed the conduct of local bodies elections in Quetta district this month and asked the Election Commission of Pakistan for postponement, informing it the government was working on legislation to make local governments effective.
He also told reports that the term of the existing local bodies’ institutions in the province would end over the next nine months and holding LG polls in Quetta only was without justification.
“Holding of election for Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) will be an unnecessary practice,” Chief Minister Bugti said, adding that election in Quetta should be held according to new local bodies law being introduced.
The BHC had ordered the ECP to hold local bodies’ election in Quetta two months back, dismissing all petitions against the holding of the election. Sub­sequently, the provincial election commissioner, Balochistan, announced the election schedule, with Dec 28 set as day of polling.
The Balochistan government filed an appeal in the election commission for the postponement of Quetta election but the appeal was rejected.
The chief minister also petitioned the ECP, which rejected the plea.

ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity.
The assessment is contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
“The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.

 

The Taliban had pledged under the 2020 Doha Agreement to prevent Afghanistan from being used to threaten other countries. While following their return to power in Aug 2021, they have aggressively targeted Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-K, their stance toward other terrorist groups has been markedly different, according to various UN assessments.
The latest report said “a wide range of member states consistently report that ISIL-K, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Isla­mic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM/TIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Ittiha­dul Mujahideen Pakistan, and others are present in Afghanistan. Some groups have used or are continuing to use Afghanistan to plan and prepare external attacks.”
Al Qaeda is assessed by the United Nations as maintaining close ties with the Taliban, with a persistent presence in several provinces. While its activities are kept low-profile, UN monitors say the group benefits from a permissive environment that allows training and reorganisation. By contrast, ISIL-K is considered the Taliban’s primary adversary. Taliban operations have degraded its territorial control, but the group has remained resilient, carrying out attacks inside Afghan­istan and abroad.
The most acute threat to regional stability, however, is seen as the TTP, which the UN report describes as enjoying strong support from elements within the Taliban and operating from Afghan sanctuaries.
“Taliban authorities continue to deny and deflect responsibility for failing to restrain TTP,” the report said. “Within the Taliban there are varying degrees of sympathy for and allegiance with TTP.”

 

“Some senior members increasingly view TTP as a liability, unnecessarily disrupting and antagonising relations with Pakistan, while others remain supportive of it,” the report said. Assessing the likelihood of the Taliban severing ties with the group under Pakistani pressure, the report said, “Given the historical ties, the Taliban are unlikely to confront or act against TTP.” It added, “Even should they wish to, they may lack the ability to do so.”
According to the report, the TTP has conducted “numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil”, making it the most serious immediate challenge to relations between Kabul and Islamabad.
“The number of TTP attacks in Pakistan has been increasing throughout 2025,” the report said. “By some estimates, there have already been more than 600 attacks in Pakistan in 2025.”
It added that “many attacks have been complex in nature, involving multiple, coordinated attackers using methods such as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, combined with teams of suicide attackers on foot”, and noted that “a majority of those conducting suicide bombings in Pakistan were reported to be Afghans”.
Pakistan has long accused the Taliban of harbouring TTP fighters, estimated by the UN report at about 6,000. These TTP fighters are said to be living in Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika and Paktia with the group’s chief Noor Wali Mehsud, reportedly living in Kabul.
An unnamed member state was said to have reported that the family of Mehsud received a monthly payment of three million afghanis (roughly $43,000) from Taliban.
The dispute over the presence of TTP in Afghanistan has severely strained ties between the two neighbours, though the Afghan Taliban were once considered to be closely allied with Pakistan.
“These attacks have led to cross-border military confrontation, causing a number of casualties, as well as disruptions to bilateral trade,” the report said. “At the time of writing, in addition to the loss of life, the closure of border crossings with Pakistan is estimated to cost the Afghan economy around $1 million per day.” The monitoring team said TTP has expanded its targeting.
“In January, TTP issued a new directive expanding targets of its attacks to include military-owned businesses,” the report said, “thereby significantly escalating its focus on the economic interests of the military of Pakistan and of Chinese enterprises in Pakistan.” It also pointed to cooperation between TTP and other terrorist groups.
Despite the broader militant presence, the report noted some counterterrorism progress made by Pakistan.
“There have also been a number of high-profile arrests by the Pakistani authorities, such as the arrest of an ISIL-K spokesperson, Sultan Aziz Azam, on 16 May 2025,” it said.
“Overall, the capability of ISIL-K has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations by the de facto authorities and Pakistan,” the report added, noting that “the arrest in mid-2025 by Turkish and Pakistani authorities of Ozgur Altun, known as Abu Yasir al-Turki, a key figure in the group’s media and logistical operations, may have contributed to the suspension of ‘Voice of Khorasan’.”
On Al Qaeda, the report said, “In March 2025, Osama Mahmoud was formally declared ‘emir’ of AQIS. He comes from Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”

According to a notification issued by the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Depar­tment on Tuesday, the GB government has banned establishment of seasonal hotels for tourists and other commercial activities within Deosai National Park for the coming season.
The notification said the GB government’s step is ai­­med at protecting the pa­­rk’s fragile ecosystem and preserving its natural beauty.

 

The commercial activities in Deosai National Park pose a threat to environmental degradation, the notification said.

Step ai­­med at protecting its fragile ecosystem

The government asked hotel owners and managements to follow new regulations and not to establish any accommodation facilities for tourists.
It warned of legal action in violation of the ban. Deosai is a high-altitude alpine plain situated at an average elevation of 4,114 meters above the sea level and it is a National Park.
Stretching between Skar­­du and Astore distri­cts, Deosai National Park is a major summer attraction for national and international tourists and it is famous for its wildflowers, Himalayan brown bears, and breathtaking landscapes and is often called the “Land of Giants”.

 

In September this year, singer Quratulain Balouch suffered injuries after being attacked by a rare Himalayan brown bear during a camping trip in the park, prompting authorities to ban the camping in the area.
The park remains open for tourists from June to November every year.

Nisar Hussain Jafri, chairman of the Pakistan Goods Transporters Allia­nce (PGTA), which represents around 20 major transport associations across the country, told Dawn that the government had accepted the group’s major demands and goods’ movement had resumed.
Earlier, PGTA President Malik Shehzad Awan announced the decision at a press conference at the Gulbai Truck Stand in Karachi along with Punjab Transport Minister Bilal Akbar and Murtaza Wahab, representing the Sindh government. He said the strike was being withdrawn on assurances given by the authorities.
“We have called off the strike after it continued for 10 days. The decision was taken after the federal, Punjab and Sindh governments accepted our demands and signed the settlement document,” said Mr Awan.
He said the authorities had agreed to substantially reduce fines and resolve issues related to axle-load limits, the issuance of heavy transport driving licences, disputes with Customs authorities and the motorway police, and controversial provisions of the amended Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
As part of the commitments, the meeting also decided the temporary allocation of 50 acres for truck parking opposite the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road under the administrative control of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). It was also agreed that around 600 acres on the Northern Bypass (M-10) would be acquired from the Sindh government and earmarked for parking to ease congestion.
The decisions included construction of a 6km stretch of the Northern Bypass by April 2026, with the remaining portion to be completed subsequently. To further facilitate port traffic, the National Highway Authority plans to expand the route to six lanes, and a detailed design will be finalised by March 2026.
On reports of container-theft gangs stealing goods from import containers, the settlement also envisaged action by the Sindh police, with the provincial inspector general tasked with investigating the complaints and taking strict action against those involved.
All Pakistan Truck Trailer Owners Association Chairman Lala Yasir Naseer confirmed that freight movement had resumed following the announcement. “After being informed by our alliance, we have conveyed instructions to our members to resume business activities,” he told Dawn.
Transporters had gone on strike over what they described as excessive fines and had demanded the withdrawal of the Traffic Ordinance 2025.
Mr Akbar said heavy fines and the registration of FIRs against transporters had been abolished. He added that fitness certificates issued in Karachi would be recognised in Punjab and would be valid for six months.
He said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had directed that truck stands be built in cities across the province, along with rest areas for drivers.
Mr Wahab, who is also Karachi’s mayor, said the Sindh government had taken transporters into confidence before making decisions affecting them.
Talks between goods transporters and representatives of the Punjab and Sindh governments, the Customs department and the Ministry of Communications were held on Tuesday but remained inconclusive.
Mr Jafri said a fresh meeting was held on Wednesday at the Customs House in Karachi, attended by the same government side and joined via video link by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, Port and Shipping Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani.
Industrialists said the strike had begun in Punjab on Dec 8, with protests in cities including Rawalpindi and Lahore led by the Punjab Public Transport Association and the Goods Transporters Association against the provincial government’s enforcement of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
They said the ordinance introduced sharply increased fines and penalties for traffic violations such as speeding, overloading and operating older vehicles, which transporters deemed an unbearable financial burden.
Industrialists estimated the textile sector alone incurred losses of around $500 million over the past 10 days, while stranded consignments attracted demurrage and detention charges at ports and factory premises.
They said production lines were forced to slow down or shut down due to disruptions in the supply of raw materials and the dispatch of finished goods, raising the risk of missed vessel sailings and cancellations of international orders.
The strike also affected the movement of industrial inputs from seaports to factories across the country.

“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said in his opening remarks.
The Republican president, who regularly complains that he does not get credit for his accomplishments, touted his administration’s work this year on a range of issues from reducing border crossings to bringing down prices of some goods.







The address offered an opportunity for the president, if he could stay on message, to address people’s concerns about affordability, an issue that Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly referred to as a Democratic hoax.
And again on Wednesday, he blamed the previous administration led by former president Joe Biden even as Trump conceded that prices remain high.
“I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast,” he said.
Trump’s Republicans are seeking to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate in November elections next year, while Democrats are highlighting affordability concerns and differences over healthcare policy in an attempt to wrest power away.
High inflation during Biden’s four years in office helped Trump beat former vice president Kamala Harris in last year’s election.
But Trump’s tariff policies this year have created uncertainty and lifted prices in an economy that has now been overseen by his administration for nearly a year — and Trump, like Biden before him, has been struggling to persuade Americans that the economy is healthy.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed just 33 per cent of US adults approve of how Trump has handled the economy.
Trump’s remarks took place in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room and not the Oval Office as presidential addresses often do.
Prior to the speech, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, contended that Trump had failed to live up to his campaign promises.
“He promised he’d bring costs down on day one. That was his number-one promise. That was the number-one reason he won the election. And costs are going up and up and up,” Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.</p><small>2025-12-18 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640044-on-international-migrants-day-pm-calls-overseas-workers-backbone-of-pakistans-economy' target='_blank'><strong>On International Migrants Day, PM calls overseas workers backbone of economy</strong></a><br><p>

Locals said several cattle heads were also burnt to death after homes caught fire during the exchange of fire.
They said that intense fighting between security forces and terrorists continued for nearly three hours. Heavy weapons and mortar shells were used during the clash, and some of the mortar shells landed in nearby populated areas, causing civilian casualties and damage to property, the residents said.
According to sources, several mortar shells fell on houses in Hasokhel and Moski villages. As a result, a civilian sustained critical injuries and later succumbed to his wounds at a hospital, while four others were seriously injured. Among the injured is the minor daughter of Malik Nisar Ali Khan, president of Awami National Party in North Waziristan.
Residents said announcements were made from mosques’ loudspeakers in nearby villages, appealing to both sides for a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of the injured.
The injured were shifted to a local hospital through rough and unpaved routes after enduring severe hardships. 
During the clash, residents said security forces’ helicopters also targeted suspected terror hideouts in the area, triggering panic and fear among residents. 
Due to the shelling, several families were forced to move to safer locations, while business activities remained suspended. 
The Bannu-Miranshah Road was also closed to all kinds of traffic.
Local people demanded that the use of heavy weapons in populated areas be avoided to prevent harm to innocent civilians.
Official sources said that the operation was launched on the basis of intelligence reports and that action against terrorists was still ongoing in the area. 
Authorities maintained that steps were being taken to ensure the safety of civilians.

There was no indication of the scale of the deployment, which comes as tensions are rising over the standoff between Latin American oil producer Venezuela and the United States.
The personnel will be deployed at Ecuador’s Manta air force base, which had served as a US base for a decade until 2009.
Ecuadoran voters in November overwhelmingly rejected a bid by President Daniel Noboa to lift the country’s ban on foreign bases. But according to the US embassy in Quito, the deployment is a “temporary operation with the Ecuadorian Air Force in Manta”.
The “short-term joint effort” will “enhance the capacity of the Ecuadorian military forces to combat narco-terrorists, including strengthening intelligence gathering and anti-drug trafficking capabilities, and is designed to protect the United States and Ecuador from the threats we share”.
Ecuador’s defence ministry said that US planes with “military material” had arrived in the country, but gave no further details.
Noboa is attempting to roll back a wave of narcotics cartel violence and has argued that Ecuador needs help to fight the gangs.
The US, under President Donald Trump, is aggressively moving to combat drug operations in Latin America. At the heart of the campaign is a growing conflict with the hard-left government in Venezuela.
Multiple US naval and air assets have been deployed in waters off Latin America and dozens of small boats allegedly running drugs have been bombed in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing at least 95 people so far.</p><small>2025-12-17 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17230342b58847f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961678/current-account-turns-positive-in-november-with-100m-surplus' target='_blank'><strong>Current account turns positive in November with $100m surplus</strong></a><br><p>The current account posted a $100 million surplus in November, which may change the trend of deficits in previous months of the current fiscal year.
However, data provided by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) shows that imports were curtailed to improve trade deficit figures during the month. The previous month, October, had posted a current account deficit of $291 million.
The previous fiscal year, FY25, surprised many by posting a net current account surplus of $1.932 billion and was widely celebrated by the government as a major positive for the economy. The surplus was also the result of tight import restrictions, which ultimately kept the economic growth rate well below the desired level. Policymakers have yet to announce a strategy to move away from import-led economic growth.
The data shows that the $100 million surplus in November was much lower than the $709 million surplus in the same month of the previous fiscal year.
In November this year, both exports and imports declined, which helped the current account post a surplus. Exports fell by 10% while imports dropped by 12% compared to October.
With this November surplus, the current account deficit for the five months from July to November FY26 has reduced to $812 million, compared with a $503 million surplus in the same period last fiscal year.
The trade deficit swelled to $37.17 billion in the first five months of FY26, making it harder for economic managers to rein in this trend.
SBP data shows that goods exports during the first five months were $12.79 billion, compared to $13.212 billion in the same period last year. Similarly, imports of goods during the first five months of FY26 were $25.559 billion, compared to $23.011 billion in the same period, showing an upward trend. Higher imports caused a large trade deficit, which ultimately puts pressure on the current account.
So far, remittance inflows have remained steady, averaging $3.2 billion per month, and are exceeding last year’s record inflows of $38 billion. The government expects remittances to reach $40 billion in FY26.
Higher remittances provide the State Bank room to buy dollars from the interbank market, boosting foreign exchange reserves and partially meeting external debt obligations. Most of the dues for debt servicing in FY25 were rolled over, and the situation in FY26 is not much different.

While briefing analysts after the Monetary Policy was announced on Monday, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed said the external debt servicing requirement for FY26 is $25.8 billion, of which $9.7 billion has already been paid or rolled over. For the remainder of this fiscal year, net external debt servicing stands at $6.9 billion, excluding rollovers.</p><small>2025-12-17 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17224002f6c1437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961676/ali-tareen-among-three-bidders-in-race-to-get-pffs-nod-for-new-league' target='_blank'><strong>Ali Tareen among three bidders in race to get PFF’s nod for new league</strong></a><br><p>Ali Tareen emerged as a surprise contender in the bidding war to hold a new football league in Pakistan, with the former owner of Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket franchise Multan Sultans in a race against two franchise league merchants, who have long tried to get an event underway.
Last month, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) had invited expressions of interest from individuals and companies looking to hold a league in a bid to revive the domestic structure of the game in the country.
Tareen confirmed on Wednesday, the deadline day for submission, that he had sent a proposal.
“I have proposed a season (six-month) long league for Pakistan football, not a flashy, one-month cash-grab tournament,” Ali wrote on X, in a jibe at the proposed franchise leagues.







Pakistan hasn’t had a functioning league since the last edition of the Pakistan Premier Football League — which had a mix of departments and a smattering of clubs — in 2019.
Ali, who was denied renewal of Multan Sultans by the Pakistan Cricket Board last month as the PSL extended its agreements with other franchises, said his proposed league will have equity ownership for the teams.
“A proper league with home and away fixtures, equity ownership in the league for the teams, derbies with two clubs per city, and mandatory women’s teams playing earlier on matchday like the Hundred (in England),” he added.
“This is the model that builds long-term value, gives fans real clubs to support, and can take Pakistan football to the next level. League > Tournament.”
Two other proposals have come from entities who have been looking to launch franchise football leagues in the country on similar lines to the PSL.
One of them is Global Soccer Ventures (GSV), which held a launch event for its proposed ‘Pakistan Football League’ in Lahore in June last year. The other expression of interest has come from Zabe Khan, who was formerly part of GSV.
“The GSV revived interest in football when there was nothing happening locally,” Pakistan football player Kaleemullah, who is one of the faces of the PSL, told Dawn, on Wednesday, referring to the launch event which featured England striker Michael Owen.
GSV claims to have sold five of its eight franchises. “We have already sold our teams and we are ready to launch,” added Kaleem.
Former K-Electric sports head Zabe left GSV following the launch event amid claims that the company had not honoured its contracts and although he did not mention who was backing him for the league, Dawn understands that it is another entity that has long harboured ambitions of setting up a franchise league.
“We need both leagues … a franchise league and a club league,” Zabe told Dawn on Wednesday. “We’ve sent a proposal for a franchise league that will run for about a month to 45 days.”
The three bidders are set to give a detailed presentation to the Mohsen Gilani-led PFF on Dec 29 after which the country’s football governing body will make a formal decision on which entity to partner with.
Last week, Mohsen said that the PFF was looking to build something “stronger and more sustainable”.
“We have invited expressions of interest and received an encouraging number of propos­als from groups determined to deliver a new and improved league system,” Mohsen told reporters at an event in Lahore.
“As a fresh leadership, we are building something stronger and more sustainable. This league will not be rushed; it will be done the right way.”</p><small>2025-12-17 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639979-nccia-officer-sarfaraz-chaudhrys-resignation-accepted-amid-ducky-bhai-row' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA officer Sarfaraz Chaudhry's resignation accepted amid Ducky Bhai row</strong></a><br><p>

According to an NCCIA notification, three officers — Deputy Director Sarfaraz Chaudhry, Assistant Director Muhammad Usman, and Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz — resigned from their posts, and their resignations were accepted by the Interior Ministry. “This is to inform that the following officers are relieved from the NCCIA from the date of approval of their resignations — Nov 20.”
Another official, Assistant Director Asma Majeed, also resigned from her post.
A mega scam involving the misuse of authority and acceptance of bribes from different suspects rocked the NCCIA in October.
Not only were nine officials of the NCCIA booked in Lahore, but also 12 in Islamabad, for allegedly taking large sums of money from individuals and call centres.
An internal inquiry found the nine NCCIA accused of operating as a network, taking monthly cash bribes to “facilitate call centres, aggregator companies and individuals involved in online fraud”.
Even investigation is underway regarding the role of some of the suspects being part of the “blasphemy gang” that would frame individuals.
Although only three NCCIA officers named in this scam have resigned so far, sources believe that all 20 or so suspected officials may be fired from the organisation, which was established in May last year.
On the other hand, the FIA, which is probing Sarfaraz Chaudhry and others, has yet to complete its investigation, raising questions about whether it is trying to “save” its former employees. Before the establishment of the NCCIA, these officials were part of the FIA Cyber Crime unit.
“All nine suspects are in jail, and no extensive interrogation has been conducted on them,” a source claimed. “FIA investigators have yet to complete the challan/investigation to submit in court.”
When asked why the FIA had failed to expedite the probe against them, a spokesperson told Dawn that “the matter is under probe.”
Nine NCCIA officers — Additional Director Sarfraz (Lahore); Deputy Directors Muhammad Zawar Ahmad, Muhammad Usman and Ayaz Khan; Assistant Directors Shoaib Riaz and Mujtaba Zafar; Inspector Salman Aziz; and Sub-inspectors Ali Raza and Yasir Ramzan — are accused of accepting bribes and abusing authority in a case against YouTuber Saad ur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai, over the alleged promotion of gambling apps on social media and through various call centres.
Ducky Bhai also recently disclosed about the “brutal torture” Sarfraz Chaudhry unleashed on him in NCCIA custody.
The YouTuber’s wife Aroob Jatoi, had accused the officials, especially Sarfraz, of taking over Rs100 million, both in local and foreign currency.
According to the First Information Report registered against the officials under Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants, the accused allegedly kept their own shares and distributed the remaining proceeds among other members of the “official gang.”
Sources said the anti-cyber crime body appeared to have “become part of the problem rather than curbing it.” There were also complaints about the exploitation of women victims by some elements within the NCCIA.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639971-goods-transporters-end-strike-after-successful-talks-with-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Goods transporters end strike after 'successful talks' with authorities</strong></a><br><p>

In line with party policy, workers who have remained loyal to the party and its ideology and have made sacrifices during the last three years will be given priority in nominations.
The decision was made during a meeting chaired by PTI Islamabad Region President Aamir Mughal and attended by Regional Secretary and Chairman of the Local Government Committee Malik Aamir Ali Awan, ticket holder Advocate Shoaib Shaheen, Senator Fauzia Arshad, Senate ticket holder Syed Farzand Shah, ticket holder Ali Bukhari, and other senior office-bearers.
After consultations, it was unanimously decided that PTI’s Islamabad wing would take part in the local government elections. However, participants feared that there could be “rigging,” as happened in the recent National Assembly elections in Haripur.
Participants were also of the view that the government had amended the 2015 Local Government Act and abolished the direct election of chairman and vice chairman to “facilitate rigging and horse-trading”, thereby undermining the public mandate. However, they said that the party would contest the local government elections with full strength and aims to achieve a clean sweep across the district.
It was decided that under the leadership of Aamir, a local government committee comprising district presidents, general secretaries, heads of all wings, ticket holders, and senior members would be formed at the earliest. Moreover, an election manifesto would be prepared, and a campaign team would be formed.
It was also decided that a legal team would be established under the committee to oversee election campaigns, the scrutiny and submission of nomination papers, and to handle all other legal matters.
It was decided that Regional President Mughal, in consultation with the leaders of all three constituencies and senior members, would form a parliamentary board to monitor ticket awarding.
Talking to Dawn, Mughal said, despite weak, flawed and “rigging-promoting amendments”, under which the local government elections are being conducted, the PTI will sweep the elections just as it did during the 2024 general elections.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced the schedule for local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory. The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to new legislation.
In a notification also posted to social media, the ECP called on voters in the ICT to elect their representatives to the general seats of union councils. It set Dec 19 as the date for public notice inviting nomination papers to be issued by the returning officers (ROs), while Dec 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on Dec 25) as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.
The names of the nominated candidates will be published on Dec 29, and the nomination papers will be scrutinised by the ROs from Dec 30 to Jan 3, 2026. From Jan 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from Jan 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on the 14.
Jan 15 marks the final day of withdrawal of candidature, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published. The polling day will take place after 29 days on Sunday, Feb 15, with the results being consolidated between the 16 and 19 of the month. The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17195829ad79b9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961668/imrans-sisters-among-400-booked-over-pti-adiala-sit-in-at-least-14-party-supporters-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sisters among 400 booked over PTI Adiala sit-in; at least 14 party supporters arrested</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — are among 400 people booked on Wednesday after police dispersed a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where the party founder and former prime minister is currently incarcerated.
Moreover, 14 PTI workers were arrested and produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) today, which approved three days of physical remand and returned the suspects to police custody.
Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka a day prior, demanding their court-mandated Tuesday meeting with the PTI founder. Police used water cannons and baton charges to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am.
According to a copy of the first information report (FIR) — dated December 17 and available with Dawn — 400 suspects, including 35 nominated persons, were booked under various provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (ATA) and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), including the use of petrol bombs and violating Section 144 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC), which prohibits public gatherings.
The nominated suspects include Imran’s sisters, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, PTI leader Aliya Hamza and PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta, among others.
The 400 suspects have been booked under the following provisions:

Section 7 of the ATA — terrorism
Section 21(I) of the ATA — aid and abetment
Section 109 of the PPC — punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment
Section 120B of the PPC — punishment of criminal conspiracy
Section 147 of the PPC — punishment for rioting
Section 149 of the PPC — every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object
Section 186 of the PPC — obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions
Section 188 of the PPC — disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant
Section 285 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter
Section 286 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance
Section 324 of the PPC — attempted murder
Section 341 of the PPC — punishment for wrongful restraint
Section 353 of the PPC — assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty
Section 440 of the PPC — mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt

‘Panic and moral bankruptcy’
The PTI condemned the cases filed against the participants of the sit-in and assailed the Punjab Police for using “chemical-laced” water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers.
In a strongly worded statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party lashed out at the government for employing force against sit-in participants and subjecting women, senior citizens and non-violent protesters to water cannons and physical violence.
The party also deemed the forcible arrest of multiple workers “the worst manifestation of political victimisation” and denounced the use of the ATA against the participants, stating that all of these actions reflected “a fearful government’s panic and moral bankruptcy”.
Weaponising the law to target citizens and peaceful political activists was also slammed as an attack on democracy, justice and fundamental human rights.
The PTI also flayed the government for deliberately, systematically and repeatedly obstructing the legally mandated bi-weekly meetings of the PTI founder with his family, lawyers and friends, “effectively reducing the court’s clear orders to mere scraps of paper”.
The party asserted that the federal government was blatantly violating the Islamabad High Court’s orders and setting a dangerous precedent, as these actions were not administrative failures and instead “constituted a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and the authority of the judiciary”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639969-elderly-man-dies-after-falling-into-nullah-in-karachis-korangi' target='_blank'><strong>Elderly man dies after falling into nullah in Karachi's Korangi</strong></a><br><p>

Alleged father-and-son perpetrators, Sajid and Naveed Akram, opened fire on a Jewish holiday celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism.
Sajid, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”.
In a post on X, Senator Rehman noted that the attack raised questions about links to New Delhi as Indian and Israeli allegations of Pakistani involvement “were backfiring at warp speed”.
“Perhaps the FATF should also look into growing support from India for terrorist groups operating internationally. The fingerprints are piling up,” she wrote, tagging the anti-terror financing watchdog.







She further wrote that though the suspects were Muslims, the man who disarmed one of the alleged attackers was himself a Muslim immigrant and hailed as a hero by Australian authorities.
“The Bondi attack is also being scaffolded away from its purported intent to terrorise per se, as an identity politics issue,” the senator’s post read.
“It must also be remembered that the many phobias, including a vicious streak of Islamophobia, generated in the wake of this heinous attack, are plain wrong. It is wrong to attack innocent people on any strip of beach or faith, whether that be Bondi or Gaza.”
Earlier today, Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said.
New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges.
“Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.
Furthermore, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-12-17 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1719323334ad768.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961667/amnesty-condemns-repeated-use-of-water-cannons-on-pti-protesters-outside-adiala-prison' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty condemns ‘repeated’ use of water cannons on PTI protesters outside Adiala Prison</strong></a><br><p>Amnesty International on Wednesday condemned the “repeated” use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities to disperse a sit-in outside Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, after incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family was denied a meeting with the former prime minister.
“The repeated use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities against peaceful protesters outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi is a flagrant violation of their right to peaceful assembly.”
Amnesty added that Pakistan authorities “must respect people’s right to peacefully protest and end the disproportionate and punitive use of force”.







After authorities again barred Imran’s sisters from meeting the incarcerated former prime minister, a sit-in was staged outside the prison.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in, which was later dispersed with water cannons.
Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2 am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained.
Some of the party workers were arrested, but the number could not be confirmed.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters.</p><small>2025-12-17 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639958-aga-khan-foundation-denmark-partner-on-climate-smart-agriculture-in-gb-chitral' target='_blank'><strong>Aga Khan Foundation, Denmark partner on climate-resilient agriculture in GB, Chitral</strong></a><br><p>

With the Ghazi’s launch, the ISPR hailed “another significant milestone” by the navy, where all four submarines being built in China are currently undergoing “rigorous sea trials and are in the final stages of being handed over to Pakistan”.
“The Government of Pakistan signed an agreement with China for [the] acquisition of eight Hangor-class submarines. Under this contract, four submarines are being built in China and [the] remaining four will be constructed in Pakistan by Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd (KS&EW), under Transfer of Technology (ToT),” the ISPR said in a statement.
The military’s media wing added that the submarines will be fitted with advanced weaponry and sensors capable of engaging targets at standoff ranges.
“Hangor-class submarines will be pivotal in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement read, adding that the launch ceremony was attended by senior officials from China and Pakistan, exemplifying deepening bilateral cooperation.
The navy launched the first of the new submarines in April 2024, while the second and third were launched on March 15 and August 15 this year, respectively.
The submarine class, named after the PNS Hangor, is a diesel-electric attack submarine with air-independent propulsion technology, which allows it to travel over greater distances before resurfacing.
During the 1971 Pakistan-India war, the then-PNS Hangor became the first submarine to sink a warship after World War II, sinking an Indian frigate. After being decommissioned, the Hangor is now on display at the Pakistan Maritime Museum in Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1718005853f6b3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961660/warner-bros-discovery-board-rejects-rival-bid-from-paramount' target='_blank'><strong>Warner Bros Discovery board rejects rival bid from Paramount</strong></a><br><p>Warner Bros Discovery’s board rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108.4 billion hostile bid on Wednesday, saying it failed to provide adequate financing assurances.
In a letter to shareholders, disclosed in a regulatory filing, the board wrote that Paramount had “consistently misled” Warner Bros shareholders that its $30-per-share cash offer was fully guaranteed, or “backstopped,” by the Ellison family, led by billionaire and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.
“It does not, and never has,” the board wrote of the guarantee of Paramount’s offer, noting that the offer posed “numerous, significant risks.”
Warner Bros’ board said it found Paramount’s offer “inferior” to the merger agreement with Netflix’s. The streaming giant’s $27.75 per share offer for Warner Bros’ film and television studios, its library and the HBO Max streaming service is a binding agreement that requires no equity financing and has robust debt commitments, the board wrote.
Warner Bros has not yet set a date for a shareholder vote on the deal but it is expected to happen sometime in spring or early summer, its Chairman Samuel Di Piazza said in an interview with CNBC.
Paramount did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Netflix welcomed the move.
“The Warner Bros Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” its co-CEO Ted Sarandos, said in a statement.
Warner Bros shares were down 1.4% at $28.5 in premarket trading, while Netflix gained 1.5% and Paramount fell 1.8%.
Paramount last week took its case directly to Warner Bros shareholders, arguing it has arranged “air-tight financing” to support its bid, with $41 billion in new equity assured by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital, and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.
Warner Bros board countered on Wednesday that Paramount’s most recent offer includes an equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind,” but rather the backing of “an unknown and opaque” Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, whose assets and liabilities are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change.
“Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was…the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” the Warner Bros board wrote. “A revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.”
Warner Bros questions Paramount’s creditworthiness
Paramount has submitted a total of six bids to acquire the entire Warner Bros studio, including its television networks, including CNN and TNT Sports.
It has previously said the Ellison family trust - which Paramount says contains more than $250 billion in assets including about 1.16 billion shares of Oracle - is more than adequate to cover the equity commitment.
“To suggest that we are not ‘good for the money’ (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,” Paramount wrote in a letter to Warner Bros’ shareholders last week. Its debt commitments are not conditioned on Paramount’s financial condition, it wrote.
Warner Bros, however, pointed in the filing Wednesday to what it described as structural risks in Paramount’s proposed financing, and also raised questions about Paramount’s financial condition and creditworthiness.
The offer relied on a seven-party, cross-conditional structure, with the Ellison Revocable Trust providing just 32% of the required equity commitment while capping its liability at $2.8 billion, Warner Bros said. It noted that the trust’s assets could be withdrawn at any time.
Debt levels after deal with Paramount will be risky
Netflix’s offer is backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet, the Warner board noted.
The company has told Warner Bros it would keep releasing the studio’s films in cinemas in a bid to ease fears that its deal would eliminate another studio and major source of theatrical films, according to people familiar with the matter.
Paramount, by contrast, has a $15 billion market capitalization and a credit rating “a notch above ‘junk,’ Warner Bros noted on Wednesday. Should the deal close, Paramount would have a debt ratio of 6.8 times its operating income “with virtually no current free cash flow.”
The bidder would also impose what Warner Bros said would be “onerous operating restrictions” on the company, during the potentially lengthy period between signing and closing, including limits on new content licensing deals.
Paramount’s plans to achieve $9 billion in “synergies” across the two studios was described as “ambitious” from an operational standpoint, the Warner Bros board noted, and would represent a new round of job losses that “would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.”
Warner Bros Discovery’s board dismissed Paramount’s charges of unfairness - that had been set forth in a filing by Paramount last week - saying it held “dozens” of calls and meetings with the studio’s principals and advisors, including four in-person meetings and meals with CEO David Zaslav and Paramount CEO David Ellison, or his father, Larry Ellison.
“After each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions,” the Warner Bros board wrote. “Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.”
Paramount said it has already applied for regulatory approval in the United States, and has alerted European regulators, shortening the path to regulatory approval.
Warner Bros Discovery’s board wrote that it considered the regulatory risks in evaluating the Netflix and Paramount offers, and believes that either transaction would obtain the necessary US and foreign regulatory approvals.
Netflix also offered a $5.8 billion break-up fee that was higher than Paramount’s $5 billion break-up fee.
The Warner Bros Discovery board also described the Paramount offer as “illusory,” adding that it could be terminated or amended at any time prior to the deal’s completion, which is not the same as a binding merger agreement.
“The PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders,” the board wrote.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639940-bondi-beach-attack-fatf-asked-to-examine-indian-links-to-terrorist-outfits' target='_blank'><strong>Bondi Beach attack: FATF asked to examine Indian links to terrorist outfits</strong></a><br><p>

Alcaraz has won six Grand Slams among his 24 tour level titles under the guidance of fellow Spaniad Ferrero, including this year’s French and US Opens.
Alcaraz, 22, ends this year as world number one having claimed eight tournaments during the season including his dramatic victory over Jannik Sinner in Paris.
“It is very difficult to write this post,” Alcaraz said on social media with photos of the pair hugging.

“After more than seven years together, ‘Juanki’ and I have decided to end our story together as coach and player.
“Thank you for making the dreams of a child become reality,” Alcaraz added.
Alcaraz began working with 45-year-old Ferrero, a former world number one, in August 2018, when he was a teenager.
As a player, Ferrero won the 2003 French Open and was runner-up in New York later in the year before becoming a coach working alongside Alexander Zverev in 2017.
Alcaraz won his first Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows in 2022 before clinching Wimbledon and the French Open, to mark a change in men’s tennis following years of dominance by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
His first success at New York sent the then 19-year-old to the top of the world rankings for the first time, becoming the second youngest man to do so, behind Lew Hoad in 1953.
‘Nostalgia’
Alacaraz has never made it further than the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, with the main draw of the first Grand Slam of next year starting on January 18.
“We started this journey when I was barely a kid, and throughout all this time you’ve been by my side on an incredible ride, on and off the court,” Alcaraz said.
“And I’ve enjoyed every step with you immensely.
“Now change is coming for both of us, new adventures and new projects.

“I’m at peace knowing we left everything out there, that we gave everything for one another.”

Alcaraz did not mention who would succeed Ferrero but according to Spanish press, assistant coach Samuel Lopez will take over.
Lopez, 55, took on his current role with Alcaraz in 2024.
Ferrero and Lopez won the 2025 ATP coach of the year award, having also secured the title three years earlier.
“Today, a very important chapter of my life comes to an end,” Ferrero said on Instagram.
“I close it with nostalgia, but also with pride and excitement for what may come next.
“I wish I could have continued. I am convinced that good memories and good people always find a way to cross paths again,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17180154d2acfb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961659/delhi-restricts-vehicles-office-attendance-in-bid-to-curb-pollution' target='_blank'><strong>Delhi restricts vehicles, office attendance in bid to curb pollution</strong></a><br><p>Authorities in India’s capital Delhi rolled out strict measures on Wednesday in an attempt to curb pollution, including a ban on vehicles not compliant with latest emission control norms and regulating attendance in private and government offices.
The air quality index in the Delhi region, home to 30 million people, has been in the “severe” category for the past few days, often crossing the 450-mark. In addition, shallow fog in parts of the city worsened visibility that affected flights and trains.
This prompted the Commission for Air Quality Management to invoke stage four, the highest level, of the graded response action plan for Delhi and surrounding areas on Saturday.
The curbs ban the entry of older diesel trucks into the city, suspend construction, including on public projects, and impose hybrid schooling.

Kapil Mishra, a minister in the local government, announced on Wednesday that all private and government offices in the city would operate with 50% attendance, with the remainder working from home, apart from some exceptions.
Additionally, all registered construction workers, many of them earning daily wages, would be given compensation of 10,000 rupees ($110) because of the ban, Mishra said at a press conference in Delhi.
India’s Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav directed authorities to ensure construction and demolition activities in Delhi and its suburbs were permitted only if proper waste handling infrastructure was available.

To better regulate traffic, the minister directed the removal of illegal encroachments and creation of corridors for smooth movement during peak traffic hours.
On Tuesday, the government enforced strict anti-pollution measures for vehicles in the city, banning vehicles that are not compliant with the latest emission control standards.
“Our government is committed to providing clean air in Delhi. We will take strict steps to ensure this in the coming days,” Delhi’s Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said late on Tuesday.
Pollution is an annual winter problem in Delhi and its suburbs, when cold, dense air traps emissions from vehicles, construction sites and crop burning in neighbouring states, pushing pollution levels to among the highest in the world and exposing residents to severe respiratory risks.
The area gets covered in a thick layer of smog with the AQI touching levels in the high 450s.

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.
Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar Raja informed the committee that, “Passengers are offloaded on the basis of document verification, data checks, and online authentication.”
Raja told the parliamentary panel that of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year, 51,000 were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.
He added that many of those offloaded lacked complete information related to their courses, universities or employment details abroad.
“In many cases, passengers attempt to travel through agents using incomplete or incorrect information,” DG FIA added.
The committee was further informed that 180 FIA officials involved in corruption had been dismissed from service, while all major airports had been connected to NADRA’s online database to strengthen immigration controls.
“No passenger was cleared under political influence or VIP pressure,” he stressed.
The official further informed the lawmakers that cameras have been installed at immigration counters at airports and that monitoring is being carried out from the control headquarters.
“The immigration system is using artificial intelligence to identify suspicious cases in advance.”
He added that most offloaded passengers belonged to the visit, Umrah and work visa categories. During the current year, 8.5 million people travelled abroad from Pakistan, while 226 cases were registered for various offences.
“Over the past three months, 450 people were arrested while attempting to cross into Iran illegally,” the DG FIA told the committee.
He also revealed that several Bangladeshi nationals were found attempting to travel illegally to Europe via Pakistan.
“Bangladeshi citizens travelling on Pakistani tourist visas were caught while heading to Europe,” added DG FIA.
He further stated that 287 people were deported last year and 170 this year over the use of fake documents.
The parliamentary panel was also told that 24,000 accused of begging have been deported from Saudi Arabia this year.
$1 trillion investment coming to Saudi Arabia; opportunities to increase for Pakistanis
Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry informed the committee that investment worth $1 trillion is coming to Saudi Arabia under Saudi Vision 2030, creating multiple employment opportunities.
“If we can provide better training to skilled manpower, Pakistan can benefit from these opportunities,” he added.
The secretary told the committee that 451,000 Pakistanis travelled to Saudi Arabia last year, while more than 500,000 Pakistanis have been sent to Saudi Arabia during the current year.
Chairman of the committee Agha Rafiullah said that the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission was “not functioning at all”, adding that officers posted there were temporarily fixing matters instead of resolving them permanently.
Committee member Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry said drivers have been provided to community welfare attachés, questioning how Grade 17–18 officers were being assigned drivers in Europe.
He said “more than 50 per cent of community welfare attachés have been provided drivers”, asking whether the ministry was aware of the cost of providing a driver to a Grade 17 officer in Europe.
Community welfare attachés are officials of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, posted abroad to assist Pakistani migrant workers, safeguard their interests, and provide legal or financial protection.
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “no passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.
“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.
In November, the FIA clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
The same day, the agency also initiated legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.
FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had also acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171215288c20709.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961640/no-evidence-alleged-bondi-gunmen-received-training-in-the-philippines-security-adviser' target='_blank'><strong>No evidence alleged Bondi gunmen received training in the Philippines: security adviser</strong></a><br><p>The Philippines’ national security adviser on Wednesday said that the father and son who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach did not receive any form of military training while in the country last month.
The alleged father-and-son perpetrators opened fire on the celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism.
Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”.
In a statement, Philippine National Security Advisor Eduardo Ao said that a mere visit to the country does not substantiate allegations of terrorist training and the duration of their stay would not have permitted any meaningful or structured training.
Ao said the government was investigating the two men’s travel from November 1 to 28 and coordinating with Australian authorities to determine the purpose of the visit, dismissing media reports portraying the southern Philippines as a hotspot for violent extremism as “outdated” and “misleading”.
Immigration records show the pair landed in Manila and travelled to Davao City in Mindanao, a region long-plagued by militancy, before the attack that Australian police say appeared to have been inspired by the Islamic State.
Since the 2017 Marawi siege, a five-month battle in which the Islamic State-inspired Maute group seized the southern city and fought government forces, Philippine troops have significantly degraded ISIS-affiliated groups, Ao said.
“The remnants of these groups have been fragmented, deprived of leadership, and operationally degraded,” he added.
Earlier today, one of the alleged gunmen was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said.
New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges.
“Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.
A court filing on Wednesday named Naveed, who remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard, as the man charged.
Australian state to pass emergency gun laws
Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state where the attack took place, told a news conference on Wednesday that parliament would return on December 22 to hear “urgent” reforms, including capping the number of firearms allowed by a single person and making certain types of shotguns harder to access.
The state government will also look at reforms making it harder to hold large street protests after terror events, in order to prevent further tensions.
“We’ve got a monumental task in front of us. It’s huge,” he said.
“It’s a huge responsibility to pull the community together. I think we need a summer of calm and togetherness, not division.”
Naveed remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard. The men accused of carrying out Sunday’s attack had travelled to the southern Philippines, weeks before the shooting that Australian police said appeared to be inspired by Islamic State.
US President Donald Trump told a Hanukkah event at the White House late on Tuesday that he was thinking of the victims of the “horrific and anti-Semitic terrorist attack”.
“We join in mourning all of those who were killed, and we’re praying for the swift recovery of the wounded,” he said.
Trump called for a global fight against “radical Islamic terrorism”.
“All nations must stand together against the evil forces of radical Islamic terrorism, and we’re doing that,” he said.







Funerals begin
Funerals of the Jewish victims of Sunday’s attack began on Wednesday, amid anger over how the gunmen — one of whom was briefly investigated for links to extremists — were allowed access to powerful firearms.
A funeral for Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an assistant rabbi at Chabad Bondi Synagogue and a father of five, was held on Wednesday.
He was known for his work for Sydney’s Jewish community through Chabad, a global organisation fostering Jewish identity and connection.
Schlanger would travel to prisons and meet with Jewish people living in Sydney’s public housing communities, Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin said on Monday.
Albanese is facing criticism that his centre-left government did not do enough to prevent the spread of anti-Semitism in Australia during the two-year Israel-Gaza war.
“We will work with the Jewish community, we want to stamp out and eradicate anti-Semitism from our society,” Albanese told reporters.
The government and intelligence services are also under pressure to explain why Sajid was allowed to legally acquire the high-powered rifles and shotguns used in the attack. The government has already promised sweeping reforms to gun laws.
His son, meanwhile, was briefly investigated by Australia’s domestic intelligence agency in 2019 over alleged links to Islamic State, but there was no evidence at the time he posed a threat, Albanese said.
Man praised as hero to undergo surgery
Albanese said Ahmed al-Ahmed, 43, the man who tackled one of the shooters to disarm his rifle and suffered gunshot wounds, was due to undergo surgery on Wednesday.
Al-Ahmed’s uncle, Mohammed al-Ahmed in Syria, said his nephew left his hometown in Syria’s northwest province of Idlib nearly 20 years ago to seek work in Australia.
“We learned through social media. I called his father and he told me that it was Ahmed. Ahmed is a hero, we’re proud of him. Syria in general is proud of him,” the uncle told Reuters.
The family of 22-year-old police officer Jack Hibbert, who was shot twice on Sunday and had been on the force for just four months, said in a statement on Wednesday that he had lost vision in one eye and faced a “long and challenging recovery” ahead.
“In the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to,” the family said.
Health authorities said 22 people were still in several Sydney hospitals.
Holocaust survivor among victims
Other shooting victims included a Holocaust survivor, a husband and wife who first approached the gunmen before they started firing, and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda, according to interviews, officials and media reports.
Matilda’s father told a Bondi vigil on Tuesday night he did not want his daughter’s legacy to be forgotten.
“We came here from Ukraine and I thought that Matilda is the most Australian name that can ever exist. So just remember the name, remember her,” local media reported him as saying.
In Bondi on Wednesday, swimmers gathered on Sydney’s most popular beach and held a minute’s silence.
“This week has obviously been very profound, and this morning, I definitely feel a sense of the community getting together, and a sense of everyone sitting together,” Archie Kalaf, a 24-year-old Bondi man, told Reuters.
“Everyone’s grieving, everyone’s understanding and processing it in their own way.”</p><small>2025-12-17 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17143644f35e9f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961654/campaign-falsely-linking-bondi-shooting-suspect-to-pakistan-launched-from-hostile-countries-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Campaign falsely linking Bondi shooting suspect to Pakistan launched from ‘hostile countries’: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
The tragic attack by two men on Sunday resulted in the death of 16 people, including one of the attackers. Soon after the incident, a Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney was misidentified as one of the attackers. Later, it was confirmed that among the father-son duo of suspects, the former, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was from India, and the latter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was born in Australia.

         View this post on Instagram            

“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.
The minister continued, “In Israel and India, this campaign was proliferated and posted on social media platforms, as well as electronic media platforms, which is very, very sad.”
He highlighted that Pakistan had been a frontline state in the war against terrorism and continued to combat terrorists. Here, he also mentioned the Army Public School massacre that took place on December 16, 2014.
A total of 147 people, including 132 students, were martyred and 180 were injured in the attack.
“So, we are a country whose children have also given sacrifices, whose children have laid down their lives in this war against terrorism,” Tarar said, adding that it was unfortunate that a “false campaign” was run against Pakistan.
He reiterated that there was not even a shred of evidence or any reliable source to back the claim that one of the Bondi Beach attackers was from Pakistan.

         View this post on Instagram            

Tarar further stated that the “misinformation campaign” against Pakistan was run deliberately, adding that it saddened him that very well-reputed media outlets fell prey to this “disinformation campaign”.
The minister said that these media houses and outlets, operating globally, had editorial boards and systems in place to verify information.
“There are structures, there is a hierarchy through which information is passed on, and editorial control is exercised. Even then, they failed to exercise the basic norms of journalism,” he said, reiterating that it was falsely claimed that one of the attackers was from Pakistan.
The claim, he said, was refuted as Indian police issued a press release on Tuesday stating that one of the suspects was from Hyderabad in India. He added that it had also been confirmed that the Indian embassy in Sydney had issued the suspect his passport.
“In fact, he travelled to the Philippines on that Indian passport as confirmed by the Philippines authorities,” Tarar said. “So, I don’t know why this campaign was run. But, it is very, very unfortunate.”
The minister then played a video that he said detailed how the campaign was run and which media outlets were involved in it.
‘Organised campaign’
After the video ended, the minister said the campaign seemed to be an organised one. “It spread like wildfire, and no editorial board, no management, no reporter questioned where the information was coming from.”
He went on to say that one of the news outlets had gone as far as claiming that the attackers were from Lahore, without showing any documentation.
“How is it possible that when you give news with regard to a terrorism incident, and you claim that the attackers are from a certain country or are of a certain origin, you have no evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim?
“It really saddens us as victims of terrorism.”
He said Pakistan had always and would always condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
Tarar pointed out that Pakistan did not instantly react to the false claim as “a responsible state acts like a responsible state by actually verifying information”.
He also questioned how it was possible that the Indian government did not know that the suspects were of “Indian origin or had Indian passports or were Indian citizens”.
“Every country has a national database through which,[using] facial recognition, it can be easily identified to which country a certain individual belongs. There are retinal scans, there are fingerprints, there is facial recognition — there is so much technology in the world now that any database would have revealed where they were from.
“But unfortunately, there was a vicious campaign to instantly say that one of the attackers, the father, was a Pakistani national,” Tarar added.
The minister linked the occurrence also to the suspects having a name that “is common in certain parts of the world”.
He said it was not sufficient evidence to pin the blame on Pakistan.
‘Who is going to cover the damage?’
Tarar also appreciated Australian authorities for “conducting themselves very professionally throughout the investigation. Despite the vicious campaign which was run all over the international media, they did not cast any aspersions in this regard, and they actually waited for this information to be verified”.
Saying that now that it was clear that the suspect was from India, Tarar added, “My question is, and I have the right to question, that who is going to cover the damage that was caused to Pakistan through these fake posts and false information.
“How do we go back to the position before the Bondi Beach attack? Should we initiate legal proceedings? Should we request an apology? Or will it just become a part of history as a campaign based on absolutely fake and false information to malign Pakistan?”
‘’India-backed terrorism in Pakistan’
He said acts of terrorism had been taking place elsewhere in the world as well, recalling the murder and assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.

 

Nijjar was shot dead by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over in 2023 after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. India was accused of being involved in his assassination, but New Delhi termed the allegation “absurd”.
“We have seen transnational assassinations taking place. We have seen this incident,” Tarar said during his briefing, adding, “We know that India supports terrorism in Pakistan.”
The minister said the Inter-Service Public Relations director general and he, too, had shared evidence of terrorism in Balochistan and Kyber Pakhtunkhwa being backed and funded by India.
“There is irrefutable evidence to prove that.”
In addition, he said, “Whenever Afghan soil is used for an attack in Pakistan, somewhere there is an indian link.”
Saying that the Afghanistan government had been cosying up to India these days, Tarar questioned: “What is the main reason behind it? Do they have any bilateral trade? Do they have other areas of mutual cooperation the great potential of which they want to realise?”
Reiterating that there was “irrefutable evidence of Indian terrorism in Pakistan”, he alleged that the country was not just involved in funding terrorism but also planning the attacks in Balochistan and KP.
Again highlighting that Pakistan had been fighting terrorism for long and rendered sacrifices in doing so, Tarar repeated that the campaign against Pakistan following the Bondi Beach shooting was unfortunate.
“And a country from where this campaign originated, and most of the Indian outlets that aired the [false] news without verification, they had no right to do this.
“Because their country is supporting terrorism, and we are fighting terrorism. That is the difference between India and Pakistan,” he continued.
Tarar further stated that now that there was credible information and irrefutable evidence of one of the suspects hailing from Indian, “how do you vindicate Pakistan in this? How do you say that ‘we are sorry and this should not have happened’”.
He asserted that while Pakistan had stood for peace, would always promote peace and condemn incidents of terrorism, the media was required to act responsibly and “pin the blame where it lies”. The media, he stressed, needed to verify the information and then disseminate it.
Again mentioning Nijjar’s assassination, Tarar said it “shows you the true face of the Indian state”.
He also mentioned the recent incident of the chief minister of Indian state of Bihar pulling off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony.
“This just shows the mindset that is prevalent in that country with regard to extremism of any kind. Their society is absolutely disoriented. They don’t have any narrative to sell to the world, any story to tell to the world.
“All you can find within India is extremism of every kind being promoted. Because you have a government [there] which believes in extremism, suppressing the minorities and their rights and promoting terrorism and extremism,” Tarar commented.
‘Highly condemnable’
Earlier in the media briefing, the minister termed the Bondi Beach shooting “highly condemnable”, adding that “since Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and has remained a victim for so many years, we actually know what it feels like”.
“We can feel the pain of Australia, the citizens of Australia. We can relate to them because we see this happening in Pakistan,” he said, expressing solidarity with the government and people of Australia.
He also lauded the Australian citizen who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers and “saved several lives”.
During the Bondi Beach incident, 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed had hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. He was hospitalised after getting injured in his bid to stop the attackers and has been hailed as a hero around the world.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639901-hostile-countries-launched-campaign-to-malign-pakistan-after-bondi-shooting-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>'Hostile countries' launched campaign to malign Pakistan after Bondi shooting: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>

According to DHS, the total includes over 605,000 formal deportations and approximately 1.9m “self-departures”, referring to migrants who left voluntarily amid intensified enforcement pressure.
The department said removals have focused on individuals it describes as criminal offenders, while also encouraging undocumented migrants to leave on their own through a government-run mobile application offering free flights and a $1,000 incentive.
The announcement — the administration’s most significant immigration update this year — comes as Washington tightens entry rules, expands travel bans, and increasingly links immigration control to national security and counter-terrorism concerns.
While DHS presented the figures as evidence of restored “law and order”, immigration experts caution that the numbers combine distinct categories that were historically reported separately. Formal deportations — court-ordered or administrative removals — are being counted alongside voluntary exits, many of which occur under the implicit threat of detention or arrest.
At the same time, the scale of interior enforcement has expanded sharply. Detention facilities operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are holding record numbers of migrants, straining capacity and raising due process concerns as immigration courts continue to face massive case backlogs.
Travel bans expanded
The DHS announcement coincides with a major expansion of US travel restrictions. On Dec 16, the White House added seven countries — including Syria and Palestinian Authority travel document holders, along with Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Laos, and Sierra Leone — to the list of nations whose citizens face full or near-total entry bans.
With these additions, 20 countries now face broad US travel restrictions, many of them Muslim-majority or conflict-affected states. The administration argues that weak identity verification systems and limited information-sharing cooperation make proper vetting impossible.
Human rights groups counter that nationality-based bans punish entire populations and undermine international norms of individual assessment, while also complicating diplomatic relations and counter-terrorism cooperation.
Security and terrorism as policy drivers
US officials have increasingly framed immigration enforcement as a national security imperative, particularly following violent incidents involving foreign nationals. The White House cited the arrest of an Afghan suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend as justification for accelerating travel restrictions.

 

But Senator Bernie Sanders,  a prominent progressive voice in US politics, cited last week’s terrorist attack in Sydney to argue against religious hatred, noting that a Muslim father risked his life to stop an attack on Jewish worshippers. In a social media statement, Sanders, who is also Jewish, said religion must not divide humanity and called for an end to antisemitism, Islamophobia and all forms of hate, describing the act as a reminder of shared human values that transcend faith and identity.
Recent terrorist attacks have stirred a global debate on immigration — as some underscored the disconnect between individual acts of solidarity and broad-brush security policies.
Implications for Pakistanis
Pakistan is not included in the current travel ban, but the broader enforcement climate has implications for Pakistani nationals in the United States.
Pakistani citizens largely reside in the US on student, work, family-based, or visitor visas, but immigration lawyers report increased scrutiny of visa renewals, status changes, and airport inspections. Visa overstays — including those who entered legally — now face a higher enforcement risk than in previous years.
Community organisations say fear of detention has reduced engagement with public institutions, particularly among mixed-status families. While no targeted measures have been announced against Pakistanis, the environment has become less predictable.
Economists warn that sudden return migration often leads to underemployment, especially for workers whose experience is tied to US labour markets. Within the US, reduced migrant labour is already being felt in agriculture, construction, and services, with employers reporting shortages and rising costs.
Internationally, the US approach has drawn mixed reactions. Some governments acknowledge Washington’s security concerns, while others warn that sweeping bans and mass deportations risk eroding humanitarian commitments and straining bilateral ties.
The DHS announcement marks a defining moment in US immigration policy — one that reflects a decisive shift toward enforcement-driven governance anchored in security concerns.</p><small>2025-12-17 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639879-pakistan-russia-strategic-partners-in-eurasia-says-senator-mushahid-hussain' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Russia strategic partners in Eurasia, says Senator Mushahid Hussain</strong></a><br><p>

He also sought the dismissal of the plea, which also calls into question the appointment of the IHC judge, “for being non-maintainable”.
The plea, filed by lawyer Mian Dawood, was declared maintainable by a division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, on December 9.
Justice Jahangiri filed a petition against the order in the FCC on Wednesday, in which he has nominated Dawood, the Federation of Pakistan, president of Pakistan, Judicial Commission of Pakistan, parliamentary committee on judges’ appointment to superior courts, Higher Education Commission, University of Karachi (KU) and a lawyer named Siraj Ahmad as respondents.
He contended that the IHC order on maintaibility of the case, a September 16 order that barred him from judicial work and the “unnecessary haste with which the division bench is proceeding” against him, “make it clear that the bench, in particular the honourable chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, is biased against” him.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, recalled that on the conclusion of the case’s hearing on December 2, the proceedings were adjourned until December 9.
It said until then, no notice had been issued to Justice Jahangiri by the IHC, and as such, neither did he appear before the court on December 2 nor was he represented.
“Nevertheless, the order dated December 2 erroneously records the attendance of ‘Mr Aleem Khan Abbasi and Mr Riasat Ali Azad, advocates for respondent no.1’(the petitioner),” it added.
Justice Jahangiri’s petition highlighted that the plea challenging his degree was declared maintainable, among other grounds, on the basis that his “eligibility” and not his “conduct” as the high court judge had been challenged.
Referring to a KU report submitted to the IHC, the petition contended that it failed to disclose a declaration by the university of the withdrawal and cancellation of the judge’s degree on September 25 stood suspended following an October 3 Sindh High Court order.
It termed the IHC order declaring the plea challenging Justice Jahangiri’s law degree “unconstitutional, unlawful and liable to be set aside”.
It was pointed out in Justice Jahangiri’s petition that the IHC division issued its order on the maintainability of the plea before issuing a notice to him. Moreover, while several parties, including those “who have not been impleaded as parties” in the plea were heard on the issue of maintainability, but Justice Jahangiri was not.
“This amounts to a violation of the petitioner’s (Justice Jahangiri) fundamental right to due process and fair trial as enshrined under Article 10-A of the Constitution.”
It was also highlighted in Justice Jahangiri’s petition that the IHC order had not been made subject to his right to question the maintainability of the plea challenging his qualification.
“This issue has been decided once and for all, behind the petitioner’s back and without hearing him.
“The impugned order is liable to be set aside on this count alone,” the petition stated.
It added that the plea challenging the judge’s qualification raised factual questions about his degree’s validity. The petition contended that a high court could not decide such “factual disputes” in exercise of its constitutional jurisdictions and that they were to be decided by “a court of competent jurisdiction after a full trial involving the recording of evidence”.
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.</p><small>2025-12-17 09:00</small></div><hr>
