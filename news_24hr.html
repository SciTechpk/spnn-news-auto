According to the Human Rights Watch, for the February 8, 2024, elections, which saw the registration of 127 million voters, there were 10 million more men than women, showing a large gender gap in a country in which women make up 49pc of the population.
Khan shared the numbers at a board review meeting of the Pakistan Legislative, Electoral, Digital Governance and Empowerment (Pledge) project.
“Women voter registration has outpaced men’s over the past five years, with a 27pc increase in female voters as compared to 17pc for males,” Khan shared with the members of the meeting.
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Dr Samuel Rizk, Ministry of Economic Affairs Joint Secretary Mahmood Khan and representatives from the British High Commission and European Union were in attendance.
“The progress is attributed to a targeted campaign, comprised of four phases, for registration of women’s national identity card numbers and enrollment of voters,” he said, adding the fifth phase was ongoing in 62 districts where the gap exceeded 10pc.
Citing a Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) report, Khan said the ECP “adds around 7,599 new voters daily”, according to district-wise data published on its website, “with women leading the numbers”.
The UNDP would launch activities in 15 districts to support the fifth phase of the women-led voter registration campaign, starting from January 2026, through which 25,000 women would be facilitated to get their national identity cards, he said. “This would automatically enrol them as voters.”
After consultation with the stakeholders, the commission introduced the Gender Mainstreaming and Social Inclusion Framework (GMSIF), under which the ECP joined the ranks of the region’s “prominent” electoral institutions, he said.
Citing the ECP’s spokesman, Khan said the meeting took a detailed review of the progress of various projects initiated during the last year, while the proposed strategy and priorities for the year 2026 were also considered.
With the support of the UNDP, an election monitoring and control centre, equipped with modern technology, was established, where a gender desk was also active, facilitating the affected communities, he said.
An effective presence on social media was ensured for public awareness and prevention of fake news and misinformation, while informational videos in Braille, 3D content and sign language were introduced for the specially-abled, Khan said, adding an important project was launched on the role of Artificial Intelligence in the electoral process.
He further said the turnout of young voters in the 2024 general elections increased significantly as a result of thousands of awareness sessions organised across the country to involve the youth in the electoral process.
UNDP Resident Representative presented the Pledge project’s 2025 report and lauded the efforts of the ECP, saying the UNDP considered the partnership with the commission to be of utmost importance.
Under the Pledge project, the UNDP would continue its technical assistance to the commission from 2025 to 2029, he said.</p><small>2025-12-18 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640185-kp-cm-announces-inclusion-of-ethics-as-subject-in-curriculum' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM announces inclusion of ethics as subject in curriculum</strong></a><br><p>

A division bench led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan issued the judgment, which was reserved earlier today, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge.
Political figures and lawyers came out and assailed the IHC ruling, stating that the “case and bench had no merit to be heard”, while standing in solidarity with Jahangiri.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan called Jahangiri’s removal an “unprecedented and troubling move” in a post on X.
“I take strong exception to the order. It further erodes judicial independence,” he wrote. “The constitutional oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution becomes meaningless if judges are unable to protect and defend themselves within their own court.”
Gohar noted that this was not the first case in which judges have been unceremoniously removed from their offices, but urged that this be the last one. He also demanded the restoration of Justice Jahangiri.







PTI lawyer Naeem Haider Panjhuta took to X and said that Jahangiri ‘s “degree became fake” when he “refused to open three constituencies”.
“Under Article 209 of the Constitution, only the Supreme Judicial Council has the authority to remove any judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court,” Panjhuta wrote.
“Not a judge of any high Court, and that judge must be one whose seniority has been challenged by the affected judge, who is sitting in the light of the 26th Amendment.”







In a post on X, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir lamented that an “ honest and brave judge was sent home for upholding his oath.
“This is a stain that cannot be erased. This is the result of the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh amendments,” she wrote. “If the lawyers let the lion of the judiciary become a martyr today, then tomorrow, when everyone’s turn comes in the jungle, no one should complain. Such a country cannot function.”
She added that lawyers need to come out onto the streets in protest of the ruling.
“In what words will the judges of this division bench be remembered? Everyone knows.”







Lawyer Hadi Ali Chatta, who is married to Imaan, also expressed solidarity with Jahangiri in a post on X
“Justice Jahangiri will remain ever alive, but those who attacked him will keep hiding their cowardly faces.”







Digital activist Usama Khilji also condemned the removal of Justice Jahangir, writing: “Bit by bit, whatever good is left in the judiciary in Pakistan is being completely dismantled — [the] question is how long will we continue to let this happen to us?”







Barrister Ahsan J Pirzada said that there was no “legal, ethical or constitutional justification for the ‘transferred’ judges of Islamabad High Court to hear or decide [the] manufactured case against honourable Justice Jahangiri”.
“This just goes to show how rotten the system has become, on one hand, 16 years old son of a ‘transferred’ judge can get away with killing two young women and on the other hand, the ‘transferred’ judges are absolutely comfortable and willing to humiliate their own institution by playing a role which is both questionable & unconstitutional,” he wrote, referring to an incident in which two women were killed by a car allegedly driven by an IHC justice’s son.

“The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity.*
“When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,”
He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.”
“The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.”
According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18.
The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10.
No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17.
Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn, “We rarely irrigate wheat crop by purchasing water from tube well owners when we have no water in designated channels.
“Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully.
“It is affecting the main and other crops as well.”
Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away.
“We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.”
Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty.
“Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums.
FO seeks clarification from India
Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week.
Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River.
“Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said.
“Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said.
“Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
“We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said.
He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”.
“The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said.
“Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.</p><small>2025-12-18 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1819113180b6399.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961853/pti-leaders-once-again-return-from-adiala-without-meeting-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders once again return from Adiala without meeting Imran</strong></a><br><p>PTI members, including former KP minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, protested the denial of meetings with party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan outside Adiala jail on Thursday.
Water cannons were used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI leaders and protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Jhagra was accompanied by PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr and Liaqat Ali Khan. They were stopped at the Dahgali checkpoint on their way to the prison and staged a sit-in on the spot. However, they quietly gathered and left after a period of time.
Jhagra wrote in a post on X: “870 unique meetings supposedly, but today was the 60th Thursday in a row when no one was allowed to meet Imran Khan,” referring to a quote by the Prime Minister’s Spokesperson Mosharraf Zaidi.
“When you learn to lie about numbers, lie shamelessly: Form 47 disease going viral from the ECP to government spokesmen!”
“However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed, but not a single meeting of Imran Khan with his political friends has been allowed,” Jhagra told reporters at the site.
“Party leaders come here every week, but they are not allowed to meet [Imran]. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, just one or two meetings of Imran Khan have been allowed with the family in which all family members were allowed to meet the former prime minister,” he added.







Jhagra said that the PTI came to Adiala to expose the “hybrid, fascist system” and to protest the use of water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers during a sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday.
“There is no law prohibiting prisoners from meeting their families,” he said. “You (the authorities) break the law by not allowing a meeting and then make it difficult to protest this. Everyone sits in a plot over there, yet you close the main road.”
He also assailed the government for filing a case against PTI members under terrorism charges and claiming that the KP government is incapable of handling terrorism.
“You call every PTI member a terrorist, misuse anti-terrorism law, people appear in anti-terrorism courts in politically-motivated cases, and you level allegations at us that we cannot combat terrorism,” Jhagra said.







He also warned the government to beware of the day when things would “get out of the hands of the party and people would take control into their hands and come on the roads”.
“It is condemnable that Imran Khan’s sons are not being allowed to talk to their father and they are unaware of his health,” he said. “This attitude is creating embarrassment for Pakistan.
“If you say that Pakistan first, the country should be placed before the hybrid system,” he suggested while replying to questions.
Replying to a question about why the party was not issuing a protest call, the ex-provincial minister said that it was the PTI’s responsibility to protect the lives of workers and not place them in front of bullets.
“Moreover, they want [KP Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to make a mistake and provide them an opportunity to take further action against the KP government,” he said.
Replying to a question, Jhagra said a major issue was that only Imran’s narrative held credibility, not the hybrid system. He also suggested that when the slogan of “Pakistan First” is chanted, Pakistan should be placed before the hybrid system.
“It was General Pervez Musharraf who allowed free media, thinking that he was the most popular figure in Pakistan. But later, when he became infamous, he himself closed the media,” he added.
When asked why CM Afridi was absent, Jhagra said that he had a “double responsibility”.
“He is running the province along with efforts to release Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
In an interview with Sky News’ Yalda Hakim, Zaidi said that Imran had 870 unique meetings during his 860 days of incarceration.
“This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers.</p><small>2025-12-18 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640173-man-brutally-assaults-domestic-worker-in-karachis-buffer-zone' target='_blank'><strong>Man brutally assaults domestic worker in Karachi's Buffer Zone</strong></a><br><p>

Reuters reported a day ago that Field Marshal Munir was expected to fly to Washington to meet US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks for a meeting which would likely focus on the Gaza force, according to two sources, one of whom was described as a key player in the CDF’s economic diplomacy.
Andrabi’s statement came during the FO’s weekly press briefing today in response to a question, where he contradicted the Reuters report about the visit.
“The Reuters story was showing as if the visit had been planned, and there was a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that and I’m contradicting the fact that a visit has been agreed or planned,” Andrabi said.
“The fact is that this is information that I do not have, about the timing or any future visit that might take place. We obviously will wait for an official announcement that the Government of Pakistan makes about such a visit.”
Andrabi noted that official announcements are issued ahead of official visits to foreign capitals carried out by political and military leaders and maintained that he had no information about Field Marshal Munir visiting the US.
In an answer to another question about the CDF’s possible visit, the spokesperson said: “As regards the visit of the Chief of the Army Staff and the Chief of Defence Forces, I do not have any information right now. I have seen the reports, but I have no information to share with you.”
The field marshal is currently on a visit to Libya, where he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Tripoli, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
CDF Munir has visited the US three times over this year.
In June, Field Marshal Munir undertook a visit to the US and met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, marking the first time an American president had hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
In August, the army chief visited the US again and termed his visit a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. He also engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Meanwhile, in September, Field Marshal Munir, accompanied by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, visited the White House and met Trump to discuss regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism and other matters.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming, and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.</p><small>2025-12-18 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1819345308a564f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961855/rise-in-mild-karachi-earthquakes-prompts-calls-for-disaster-preparedness' target='_blank'><strong>Rise in mild Karachi earthquakes prompts calls for disaster preparedness</strong></a><br><p>In June, consecutive tremors shook Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Fifty-seven low-intensity quakes, measuring 1.5-3.8 on the Richter scale, were recorded on 1-25 June, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reportedly said. Several months later, October began with a 3.2-magnitude quake in Malir, a neighbourhood in the city’s north.
Karachi sits near the boundaries of three major tectonic plates, and multiple fault lines run through the city. Some 49 earthquakes with a magnitude of four or above have struck within 300 km of Karachi in the last decade.
Mild quakes can sometimes act as “natural pressure releases, potentially reducing the risk of more destructive ones”, but the frequency of these earthquakes has raised concerns among experts, said geological oceanographer and former director of the Geological Survey of Pakistan, Asif Rana.
In Karachi, mild quakes can have potentially devastating impacts on buildings that lack structural integrity. The Association of Builders and Developers stated in July that some 700 buildings have been identified in the city as not stable enough for safe habitation. This was shortly after a dilapidated building collapsed in the densely populated Lyari area with no earthquake involved, killing 27 people.
Rana warns that, in densely populated areas, even moderate tremors of magnitude 3-4 can lead to “partial or complete collapse of vulnerable old buildings”.
Amid these dangers, experts say more needs to be done to improve structural resilience and disaster preparedness in Karachi. They have in mind a more powerful earthquake. “If a repeat of the 1945 event, the magnitude of which was 8.1, occurs near the Makran triple junction, much of coastal Karachi could be devastated,” noted Moin Raza Khan, an oil, gas and minerals exploration expert, on LinkedIn.
The Makran triple junction lies between the Eurasian, Indian and Arabian plates, which Karachi is located around 150 km from.
What makes Karachi’s buildings vulnerable?
Experts say buildings in Karachi are endangered by even mild earthquakes due to their unregulated construction, with instability being exacerbated by land subsidence.
Rapid urban development and construction are key reasons for the subsidence, notes Seema Naz Siddiqui, a retired professor of geology.
Before construction commences, groundwater, which supports the underground layers of soil and rock by filling the spaces between them, is pumped out to make the excavation area dry and stable.
Much of Karachi’s soils are already weak, being water-saturated and compressible sediments prone to liquefaction, noted Moin Raza Khan in an opinion piece for the Business Recorder. The excavation and piling from the subsequent construction disturb subsurface layers, explains hydrogeologist Haziq Khan.
In such conditions, soil compaction intensifies, leading to uneven settlement and structural instability, notes Haziq.
He adds that neighbourhoods in Karachi built on soft clays or alluvial deposits – material deposited by rivers, such as silt, mud or sand – are most vulnerable as their typically shallow water tables amplify soil weakness. A 2022 study noted that much of the Karachi metropolis has been built above alluvium deposits.
Unregulated high-rise construction accelerates subsidence by adding heavy loads to the weak soil, he says.
These fragile soils and unchecked groundwater withdrawal, when combined with weak building-code compliance, could make even moderate seismic events into disasters, says Haziq.
He notes that areas lacking proper planning codes and foundation design face disproportionate risks, particularly dense urban zones with poor drainage. This includes areas such as North Karachi and parts of the Old City.
The poor drainage prevents water from escaping, saturating loose soil and making it vulnerable to liquefaction, thereby contributing to subsidence.
Smaller constructions face risks too, notes Zahid Farooq, an urban-planning expert and board member of the Karachi non-profit Urban Resource Centre. He highlights that houses are typically built on small plots, with extra floors added to the building as the family expands. Throughout this process, “no one checks how old or strong the foundation is”.
A 2023 study estimates subsidence in key areas of the city at up to about 17 mm annually and notes that the rate is steadily increasing. It stated that in some areas, subsidence may be partly caused by damaged infrastructure such as broken sewer and water lines. These have been noted as the cause of “variations in localised subsidence patterns where leaking water may cause liquefaction and subsidence over time”.
The study also established that the city has an active fault, meaning it is likely to result in an earthquake in future. The authors note that the data demonstrates a “clear displacement along the fault, most notably along a 10 km-long section”. This poses an “alarming risk” to the city due to a lack of studies on the strain accumulation – the storing of energy that, when eventually released, leads to an earthquake – of this fault. The lack of data leaves the city “unprepared to forecast and plan for the potential of a large seismic event”.
Talking solutions
Amid these risks, experts say Karachi’s safety can be improved through a combination of managing subsidence, enforcing building codes and doing geophysical surveys.
Haziq says subsidence risks can be mitigated by enforcing “geotechnical-based” building codes [meaning grounded in the realities of the soil and subsurface] and restricting high-rise construction in vulnerable zones.
Urban planning should integrate drainage improvements and land-use zoning, Haziq adds.
Rainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge can also help stabilise soil by maintaining groundwater levels and reducing compaction, he notes.
But while these measures slow further subsidence, they cannot reverse permanent soil settlement, he says, making early prevention essential. To do this, groundwater extraction would need to be seriously curtailed. “We would need to enforce bans or strict limits on unregulated borewells and tanker [companies] drilling [for water]”, he says. Pakistan’s National Water Conservation Strategy for 2023-2027 has called for monitoring and controlling of groundwater extraction.
Haziq suggests a few solutions the government could implement: expanding piped-water networks to avoid the need for unregulated borewells; establishing recharge schemes to balance extraction and replenishment; curbing water overuse through public and industrial awareness on conservation, and by encouraging reporting of illegal borewells.
Karachi also needs to undertake regular earthquake drills, he says.
Rana notes that Pakistan’s building code – adopted in 2007 after the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake that killed at least 79,000 people – takes important steps toward addressing earthquake risks. But, he said, “there’s still a long road ahead in terms of enforcement and adaptation”. While the building code is a solid framework, many local bylaws in Karachi do not fully enforce it, he adds.
Siddiqui stresses the importance of increasing awareness about disaster preparedness, lamenting the lack of any dedicated avenues to talk about approaches. “We need forums where scientific and practical solutions are discussed, and governance policies are developed to face the potential disasters that earthquakes in Karachi can cause.”
Farooq says authorities also have a responsibility to conduct surveys to “ensure that the land [being built on] is not on or near a fault line”.
Haziq said conducting detailed geophysical surveys via satellite InSAR, which measures ground deformation using radar images, and seismic monitoring in the tremor zones can help map subsidence and fault behaviour.
While the earthquake’s magnitudes have been low, their frequency raises enough cause for concern about the city’s tectonic drivers, subsidence and urban vulnerability, wrote Moin Raza Khan. “History reminds us – from the 1935 Quetta earthquake to the 1945 Makran tsunami-generating quake – that our risks are not theoretical.”
He stresses: “This is not alarmism – it is a call for preparedness, policy reform, and urgent resilience measures”.

A short written order of the court, available with Dawn, said at the time of Justice Jahangiri’s appointment as an additional judge of the IHC, “as well as at the time of his confirmation as a judge of the Islamabad High Court, he was not holding a valid LLB degree, which is a prerequisite for enrolment as an advocate”.
“When he could not be considered as an advocate, then consequently he was not eligible for elevation as a judge of a high court in terms of the requirements of Article 175-A of the Constitution,” it added.
On the basis of this observation, the court ruled that Justice Jahangiri’s elevation to the IHC was “without lawful authority, as he was not eligible to be elevated as a judge of a high court”.
“Thus, he ceased to hold the office of the judge of Islamabad High Court forthwith.”
The court also directed the law ministry to denotify him as a judge of the IHC.
“All the pending miscellaneous applications are also disposed of,” it added.
The bench’s decision comes a day after Justice Jahangiri accused CJ Dogar of being “biased” against him and requested the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to set aside the recent IHC decision to hear a petition challenging his law degree. The same day, he also filed a formal complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — against the chief justice.
The hearing
Prior to the issuance of the judgement, University of Karachi (KU) Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted a record of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree to the court.
He said the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s degree for having been “secured through unfair means”.
“Justice Jahangiri was found cheating and creating disturbance in an examination hall in 1988,” following which he was debarred from sitting an exam until 1992, he said.
However, instead of complying with the decision, the judge appeared in an exam in 1989 under a changed name, the registrar alleged.
He also submitted a log pertaining to marksheets and results to justify the KU syndicate’s decision.
During his arguments, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, who was representing Justice Jahangiri, objected to the bench hearing the case.
He contended that a judge who faced legal proceedings could not hear the petition involving a fellow judge, who had challenged his posting.
In July, Justice Jahagiri, along with four other IHC judges, had filed an intra-court appeal against the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges requested the SC not to consider Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they took fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The intra-court appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Constitutional Amendment and eventually dismissed for non-prosecution.
Sheikh’s argument today seemed to be referring to this matter.
He also highlighted that the Sindh High Court (SHC) had issued a stay order in connection with the matter, arguing that the IHC bench should not hear the case.
This, seemingly, was a reference ot the SHC order suspending the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree by the KU syndicate.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmad, who was also representing Justice Jahangiri, requested more time from the court to submit a reply.
For his part, the petitioner in the case, lawyer Mian Dawood, alleged that Justice Jahangiri had “misused” the SHC stay order. “Instead of clearing his name […] the judge has been filing petitions and scandalising his chief justice,” he commented.
According to the court’s short written order, the bench observed that it had given “ample opportunity” to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply along with disputed education credentials, “but he failed to do so for the reasons best known to him”.
“As such, this court has left with no other option but to proceed further in the matter.”
The court also observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge “is personal to the individual and has no nexus with the performance of duties as a court or as a member of the court”.
“The qualifications for appointment of judges of the superior courts are duly provided in the Constitution. Possession of the qualifications prescribed under the Constitution is sine qua non (requirement) for an individual to hold the office of a judge of a superior court,” it said.
The court order further stated that during the case’s proceedings, it had heard arguments from counsel for the contesting parties, the representatives of the Islamabad Bar Council, IHC and Islamabad District Bar Associations, and perused the record with their able assistance.
Eventually, the court reserved its judgement in the case earlier today and later ordered the removal of Justice Jahangiri.
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the KU controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the SJC last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by Dawood.
The controversy followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
After the IHC resumed the case’s proceedings, the Higher Education Commi­ssion (HEC) submitted a detailed report to the court on December 8, endorsing KU’s findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
The HEC claimed it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
At the next hearing on December 9, the court declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
Another notable development in the case came on December 15, when Justice Jahangiri appeared before the court in person, presented arguments in his defence and raised objections on the division hearing his case. He expressed a lack of confidence in the bench on the ground that he had filed an intra-court appeal CJ Dogar.
He also took exception to the “haste” in which the proceedings were being held and criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
The court, however, dimissed his objections.
On December 17 — a day before today’s hearing — Justice Jahangiri moved a plea through senior counsel Uzair Karamat Bhandari in the FCC, requesting it to set aside the Dec 9 order that declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
The FCC was told that CJ Dogar was biased against Justice Jahangiri and therefore disqualified from hearing any matter relating to his appointment. Justice Jahangiri recalled in the petition that he had already challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC, followed by his elevation as IHC CJ and in these circumstances judicial propriety required that the IHC chief justice should not preside over proceedings concerning the writ of quo warranto.
Separately, Justice Jahangiri also filed a formal complaint against his boss, IHC CJ Dogar, before the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution, accusing him of misconduct, bias, and violation of the Code of Conduct for Judges in relation to proceedings concerning the legitimacy of his degree and appointment.
According to the complaint, while the matter was sub judice, the IHC chief justice discussed the pending case with Justice Jahangiri and advised him, both directly and indirectly, to resign from office. Justice Jahangiri asserted that such conduct alone disqualified Justice Dogar from hearing the case.
The complaint alleged that during these discussions, the chief justice acknowledged that “tremendous pressure” was being exerted on him to decide the matter expeditiously and against Justice Jahangiri. It was claimed that Justice Dogar suggested that if he were to submit a post-dated resignation and hand it over to him for ‘safe-keeping’, it would help placate those exerting pressure and allow proceedings to be delayed.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.
He was also among the five IHC judges who submitted separate petitions at the SC together in September against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.</p><small>2025-12-18 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/181811455ecd225.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961850/nccia-uncovers-alleged-ponzi-network-in-karachi-detains-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA uncovers alleged Ponzi network in Karachi, detains foreign nationals</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), in a joint raid along with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, arrested several foreign nationals allegedly running a fraudulent Ponzi scheme network in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area on Thursday, a statement from the agency said.
A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.
Per the statement, the operation was conducted in DHA Phase 1 and Phase 6, where several foreign nationals were taken into custody during the action.
“Important and sensitive data was recovered from the suspects, which is now being examined as part of the investigation,” the statement said.
Preliminary inquiries suggest the detained individuals were allegedly running a “well-organised network through a Ponzi scheme,” the statement said, adding that the fraud had affected thousands of people, causing them “serious financial losses”.
However, the further details about the extent of the crime and the people involved were not confirmed.
Authorities said further legal action will be initiated against the network, while investigations are ongoing to determine the full scope of the operation and identify additional suspects.
In July, the NCCIA had also captured a Ponzi ring by raiding a factory in Faisalabad, arresting 149 suspects, including 48 Chinese nationals.
In Feb, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore had launched a crackdown against several entities for their involvement in financial scandals, drawing thousands of people to invest in fraudulent schemes.
The term ‘Ponzi’ scheme came from Charles Ponzi, who in the 1920s promised high returns through a fake investment system involving international postal vouchers. Instead of making legitimate investments, he paid returns to earlier investors with the money from new ones. This fraudulent model continues to thrive online today.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640161-trump-neither-cold-war-hawk-nor-warmonger-ex-federal-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Trump neither Cold War hawk nor warmonger: ex-federal minister</strong></a><br><p>

Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, dozens of demonstrators began marching towards the assistant Indian high commissioner office in Rajshahi district, which borders India.
Miftahul Jannat, one of the protesters, said the plan was to carry out a sit-in, demanding the “repatriation of all the killers including Sheikh Hasina”.
The protest was stalled by the police, who said they “listened to their demands and promised to forward them to the authorities”.
“We are not aware of any further plans (for demonstrations) and hope the issue will be resolved peacefully,” Nashid Farhad, a senior officer with the Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, told AFP.
On Wednesday, a group of protesters tried to march towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Bangladesh’s top diplomat in New Delhi to convey its concerns about the actions of some “extremist elements”.
In a statement, the ministry also said it expected the interim government under Muhammad Yunus to “ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations”.
Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia by a Bangladesh court last month for crimes against humanity.
The country of 170 million people goes to the polls on February 12, with Hasina’s former ruling party, the Awami League, banned from running.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18174248f308e4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961847/germany-to-take-in-more-than-500-stranded-afghans-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Germany to take in more than 500 stranded Afghans from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The German government said on Thursday that it would take in 535 Afghans who had been promised refuge in Germany but have been stuck in limbo in Pakistan.
Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the RND media network that Berlin wanted to complete the processing of the cases “in December, as far as possible” to allow them to enter Germany.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government, but have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
Those on the scheme either worked with German armed forces in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban, or were judged to be at particular risk from the Taliban after its return to power in 2021 — for example, rights activists and journalists, as well as their families.
Pakistan had set a deadline for the end of the year for the Afghans’ cases to be settled, after which they would be deported back to their homeland.
Dobrindt said that “we are in touch with the Pakistani authorities about this,” adding: “It could be that there are a few cases which we will have to work on in the new year.”
Last week, the interior ministry said it had informed 650 people on the programme they would not be admitted, as the new government deemed it was no longer in Germany’s “interest”.
The government has offered those still in Pakistan money to give up their claim of settling in Germany, but as of mid-November, only 62 people had taken up the offer.
Earlier this month, more than 250 organisations in Germany, including Amnesty International, Save the Children and Human Rights Watch, said there were around 1,800 Afghans from the programme in limbo in Pakistan, and urged the government to let them in.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18170347bc0e25a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961844/gb-general-elections-local-body-polls-delayed-due-to-harsh-weather-conditions-cec-khan' target='_blank'><strong>GB general elections, local body polls delayed due to harsh weather conditions: CEC Khan</strong></a><br><p>Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Raja Shehbaz Khan on Thursday announced a delay of general elections and local bodies polls due to harsh weather conditions in the region, after a multiparty conference held to consult political parties on the holding of the elections.
General Elections of the Assembly and local government (LG) elections were scheduled for January 24 and February 14, 2026, respectively. The LG polls are going to be conducted in the region after a gap of 20 years.
“The new polling dates for both elections will be announced later,” Khan said.
After the GB Assembly completed its five-year tenure on November 24, President Asif Ali Zardari announced the general elections date as it is mandatory to conduct elections within 60 days, while the GB election commissioner also announced the date of local body elections.
Meanwhile, the GB Election Commission convened a multiparty conference (MPC), including leaders of PML-N, PPP, PTI and JUI, today at its secretariat to consult political parties on the holding of elections in January and February.
After the meeting, the GB CEC said the meeting was convened to seek views of the political parties, their suggestions and guidance on key electoral matters to make the process effective, transparent and in line with democratic principles.
Representatives of the political parties attended the consultative meeting and shared their views and suggestions with the election commission, he said,
While 14 political parties opposed the holding of elections in January and February due to harsh weather conditions in the region that cut off many areas from the rest of the region, six party leaders favoured the polling day, he said.
The leaders, who opposed the election dates, argued that people in the region couldn’t use their right to vote due to the weather conditions, they argued.
Meanwhile, 14 petitions were submitted with the GB Election Commission challenging the polling day of the general elections and demanding the postponement of the polls, he said.
Khan agreed with the majority opinions and announced to withdraw the general elections and local bodies polls on January 24 and February 14, respectively.
According to a source, the commission was considering holding the general and local body elections simultaneously in the month of May 2026.</p><small>2025-12-18 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1816422565a2b03.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961842/uk-teachers-to-tackle-misogyny-in-classroom-as-govt-deploys-new-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>UK teachers to tackle misogyny in classroom as govt deploys new strategy</strong></a><br><p>UK teachers will be trained to tackle misogyny in the classroom under a new strategy aimed at halving violence against women and girls over the next decade, the government said Thursday.
The new strategy would “deploy the full power of the state to introduce the largest crackdown to stop violence perpetrated against women and girls in British history”, said Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, who is due to unveil details of the new approach in parliament later.







The 20 million plan comes as the latest statistics showed over 40 per cent of young men held a positive view of so-called manosphere influencer Andrew Tate, a government statement said.
And over the last year alone, one in every eight women was a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking.
“For too long, the scale of violence against women and girls has been treated as a fact of life in our country,” said Phillips.
Under the strategy, all secondary schools in England will have to teach students about healthy relationships.
Teachers will receive specialist training to talk to pupils about issues such as consent and the dangers of sharing intimate images.
“Tackling the most worrying attitudes as early as possible, schools will also send high-risk individuals to get the extra care and support they need, focused on challenging deep-rooted misogynist influences,” the statement added.
A new helpline would also be launched, targeted at pupils concerned about their own behaviour.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the strategy was about “driving forward education and conversation with boys and young men”
“I want my daughter to grow up in a Britain where she feels safe in school, online, and in relationships,” he said on X.
“Every young girl deserves that, and every young boy should be protected from harmful misogynistic influences. My government is making that happen by backing teachers,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-18 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640146-karachi-choked-by-dug-up-roads-as-authorities-fail-to-act' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi choked by dug-up roads as 'authorities fail to act'</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the minister wrote that widespread AI adoption is affecting the employment of creative minds in the sector, specifically referring to content creators, graphic designers and editors, creative directors, actors and models and technicians and cameramen.
“I am inviting proposals on how to address this problem and how to save these professions from becoming redundant,” Tarar wrote, urging people to send proposals to an email address linked to the Press Information Department.







An International Labour Organisation (ILO) report published in May found that around “one in four workers across the world are in an occupation with some degree of exposure” to generative AI models’ capabilities.
“Few jobs are currently at high risk of full automation,” the ILO added.
In November, polling firm Ipsos asked 9,000 people to listen to two clips of AI-generated music and one of human-made music in a survey conducted for France-based streaming platform Deezer.
“Ninety-seven per cent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,” said Deezer. The platform added that more than half of the respondents to its survey felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.
Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 per cent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it would lead to a loss of creativity.</p><small>2025-12-18 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/181552016a1feae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961840/pm-shehbaz-approves-halal-meat-export-policy-orders-preparation-of-strategy-to-enhance-exports' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz approves halal meat export policy, orders preparation of strategy to enhance exports</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday approved the halal meat export policy and directed relevant authorities to present a comprehensive, three-year strategy within two weeks, comprising measures to increase exports.
Pakistan barely has a 0.25 per cent share in the global halal food trade of more than $3 trillion, which reflects the need for the government and private sector to take proactive initiatives to explore the true potential of ‘Made in Pakistan’ products and establish a niche for itself.
The decision was made during a meeting of a committee established to enhance Pakistan’s halal meat export market, focusing on the export policy and sector reforms. PM Shehbaz was presiding over the meeting.
“A comprehensive strategy, formulated through coordination among all relevant federal ministries and provincial governments, is essential and significant to make Pakistan’s share in the halal meat market of Muslim countries as well as the global market,” PM Shehbaz said.
He asked officials to present proposals for improving production, cold storage, and other related aspects of the initiative.
He also directed the relevant authorities to take special measures for increasing halal meat production in livestock in accordance with international standards and for remaining competitive with regional production volumes.
Organised centres, developed through cooperation between relevant federal ministries and provincial governments, were urgently needed to enhance the production and nutritional value of halal meat, the prime minister stressed.
“There is considerable potential to increase Pakistan’s export share in Muslim countries as well as in the global halal meat market,” he said, assuring the industry that the government would provide full support for international certification of slaughterhouses and bilateral registrations with other countries.
The premier also directed relevant authorities to take special measures for ensuring disease-free conditions and international-standard hygiene arrangements in slaughterhouses across the country.
During the briefing, the prime minister was informed that Pakistan’s total halal meat production stood at six million metric tons, and after fulfilling domestic requirements, a substantial quantity was available for export.
Special measures are being undertaken to increase halal meat production and ensure international standard packaging, the prime minister was informed by the committee.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar, and other relevant government officials.
In October, Malaysia expressed interest in importing $200 million worth of Halal meat from Pakistan. The following month, Jam Kamal directed all relevant stakeholders to coordinate with the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to achieve the target in meat exports to the Southeast Asian country.</p><small>2025-12-18 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640114-degree-case-ihc-orders-to-remove-justice-jahangiri-from-post' target='_blank'><strong>Degree case: IHC orders to remove Justice Jahangiri from post</strong></a><br><p>

LHC’s Justice Ali Zia Bajwa made the observations in an order issued after a hearing held at the Multan Bench. On Wednesday, the judge had heard a petition filed by a citizen, Shaheryar Qandeel, against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other authorities following his offloading from a flight despite being in possession of valid travel documents.
In the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Justice Bajwa said, “Let this court take a moment to remind the FIA and all concerned authorities that every exercise of power that infringes upon the fundamental rights of an individual must find its firm and unambiguous foundation in law.”
He said that no administrative discretion, however broad, could justify curbing the liberty of citizens unless “it is traceable to a clear statutory provision or legal mandate”.
Justice Bajwa held that the rule of law demanded that no person be deprived of their right to move freely or leave the country except through due process and fair procedure.
“The rule of law demands that no person should be deprived of their right to travel, move freely, or leave the country, particularly when in possession of valid travel documents, except in accordance with law, due process, and fair procedure,” he said.
The judge also noted that during the proceedings, the law officers and FIA officials again sought additional time to identify the specific statutory provisions or rules that empowered them to restrain passengers at the “eleventh hour”.
The judge also expressed concern after learning from the law officers that no written reasons for the petitioner’s offloading were available on the record. The judge directed the FIA to provide the petitioner with written reasons for his offloading well before the next hearing.
Justice Bajwa ruled that this requirement was not a mere formality, but a “substantive safeguard to uphold transparency, accountability, and the individual’s right to seek redress”.
“The failure to provide such reasons not only contravenes the principles of natural justice and due process but also constitutes a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of movement,” the judge maintained.
The case has been relisted at a future date, when law officers are expected to assist the court by citing the specific legal provisions that allow for such travel restrictions.
The development comes as, over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.</p><small>2025-12-18 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18135229fd3d2be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961833/complaint-filed-against-bihar-cm-for-pulling-down-womans-niqab-indian-media' target='_blank'><strong>Complaint filed against Bihar CM for pulling down woman’s niqab: Indian media</strong></a><br><p>A complaint has been filed with police against the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, and Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sanjay Nishad in relation to an incident involving the former pulling a woman’s face veil (niqab), according to Indian media.
Kumar has been facing criticism after he pulled off a woman doctor’s niqab at a graduation ceremony. A clip of the incident was widely shared on social media, showing the 74-year-old politician handing a certificate to a woman doctor during the event on Monday and motioning to her to remove her niqab.
Before the woman could react, Kumar reached out and pulled down the niqab, exposing her mouth and chin.
While the clip has sparked widespread outrage across India and Pakistan, with social media users, activists and commentators demanding an apology and resignation of the chief minister, Nishad made remarks belittling the gravity of the incident, questioning the outrage over “mere removal of a burqa”.
Indian news agency ANI reported on Wednesday that Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Sumaiya Rana had lodged a complaint with police in Lucknow, seeking “strict legal action” and the registration of a first information report against the two leaders.
Speaking to ANI, the SP leader criticised the chief minister for his actions.
“A video of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar is going viral on social media in which he is seen pulling down a woman’s hijab … For a person holding a constitutional position to behave in this manner means he is encouraging his other workers to engage in similar acts”, she was quoted as saying.
According to ANI, Rana also objected to Nishad’s remarks and recalled that the minister had commented that “why is there so much controversy over removing a burqa. His hand only touched her face. If his hand had touched somewhere else, what would have happened then?”
“Based on this, I have filed a complaint,” she said.
Advocate Misham Zaidi, who was one of the lawyers present with Rana, said that Kumar’s act and the remarks by Nishad had “hurt the modesty of a woman”, ANI reported.
“What Sanjay Nishad has done incites religious sentiments,” he was quoted as saying. “This is a clear-cut case under Section 153A, as you are knowingly engaging in such acts that could instigate riots, create unrest, and disturb the law and order of the state.”
Meanwhile, he added, “Section 354 will be applied to him (Nitish Kumar) directly for grabbing and pulling it (the niqab).”
According to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 153A pertains to the incitement of “enmity between different groups on [grounds] of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language,” while Section 354 of IPC deals with “assault or use of criminal force on a woman with intent to “outrage her modesty”.
For his part, Nishad has maintained that his remarks have been “misinterpreted”.
Speaking to the Indian news agency Press Trust of India (PTI), he alleged that his comment “was lost in translation and carried no ill intent.”
“My remark was tweaked and twisted, misinterpreted, its spirit lost in cacophony and translation,“ Nishad was quoted as saying.</p><small>2025-12-18 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18130410d356760.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961829/cdf-field-marshal-munir-reaffirms-commitment-to-strengthening-defence-ties-with-libya' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirms commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
In a statement, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the field marshal was currently on an official visit to Libya, where he called on the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, and deputy commander in chief, Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar.
“On arrival, the field marshal was accorded a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Libyan Armed Forces,” the ISPR said.







In a meeting with the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, “based on shared interests”, it said.
It added that during the meeting, the two discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military-to-military cooperation.
“Both sides underscored the importance of collaboration in training, capacity building, and counter-terrorism domains,” it said.
“Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and expressed his desire to further expand defence cooperation between the two countries,” the ISPR statement added.
In July, Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa had called on Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, where the two had agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry.
“Both leaders agreed to undertake defence industrial collaboration and exchange of technical expertise to address contemporary security challenges,” an ISPR statement said at the time.</p><small>2025-12-18 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1813414149312bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961832/trump-administration-intends-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-revoke-citizenship-of-some-naturalised-americans-report' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration intends to ramp up efforts to revoke citizenship of some naturalised Americans: report</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration intends to increase its efforts to strip some naturalised Americans of their US citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times.
The move comes as US President Donald Trump, in a prime-time address, pledged to further intensify his hard-line immigration policies, signalling a broader crackdown on migrants and stricter enforcement measures across the country.
Internal instructions issued this week to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field offices direct them to “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100–200 denaturalisation cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year, the Times reported.
That would mark a dramatic increase in denaturalisation cases, which, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Centre, stood at about 11 per year between 1990 and 2017.
A USCIS spokesperson told Reuters that the agency’s focus was on individuals who “unlawfully obtained US citizenship”, asserting that the expanded denaturalisation push forms part of efforts to combat immigration fraud.
In the US, the government can revoke the US citizenship of a naturalised citizen for various criminal and security issues.
Denaturalisation cases are civil actions filed in federal court and historically have been pursued sparingly.
Under US law, denaturalisation can occur only in specific circumstances — principally when citizenship was “illegally procured” or gained by fraud or misrepresentation during the naturalisation process.
The timeline for denaturalisation cases varies, but they can take years to resolve.
Trump’s remarks on immigration
In his rapid-fire address at the White House, Trump reinforced his administration’s broader immigration agenda, touching on economic and other policy themes, with immigration a recurring emphasis.
While not unveiling new immigration measures during the speech itself, he continued longstanding attacks on US border policy and blamed his predecessors for what he described as national security and social challenges.
In early December, Trump told reporters that he would “absolutely” denaturalise some US citizens if he had the authority to do so — specifically citing what he characterised as “criminals that came into our country and … were naturalised maybe through [Joe] Biden or somebody that didn’t know what they were doing”.
Trump also has used strong language about current and prospective immigrants, saying “we don’t want those people” when discussing certain asylum seekers and signalling that asylum decisions could be paused “for a long time”.
These comments come in the wake of a deadly shooting in Washington involving an Afghan national who had been granted asylum earlier this year, which the administration has cited in defence of tightening immigration controls.
Earlier this month, Trump announced on social media that his administration would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and promised measures to remove immigrants he labelled as security risks or burdens on federal benefits systems.
Earlier this week, Trump also added seven additional countries to a full travel ban list and imposed partial restrictions on several more, continuing a broader crackdown on entry from nations it deems to have deficient vetting systems.
Broader immigration enforcement
The expanded denaturalisation guidance arrives amid a broader suite of immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration.
These include expanded travel bans affecting citizens of multiple countries, a halt or severe curtailment of asylum processing, and a review of green cards and immigration status for nationals from countries the administration designates as “countries of concern”.
Critics of the denaturalisation push warn that applying numerical targets to citizenship revocation — a process historically reserved for clear fraud in the naturalisation process — could politicise what should be a narrowly applied enforcement tool and inject fear into immigrant communities.
Trump’s supporters, however, argue that safeguarding the integrity of the naturalisation system is essential and that fraud should be pursued vigorously within the bounds of law.
As implementation begins, federal courts will be the ultimate arbiter of individual denaturalisation actions, and the legal and social ramifications of the policy shift are likely to be subjects of intense debate in legal, immigrant advocacy, and policy circles.

The alleged father-and-son gunmen opened fire as hundreds of people celebrated Hanukkah on Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach on Sunday. The attack, which shocked the nation and led to fears over rising anti-Semitism, appears to have been inspired by the Islamic State, authorities say.
Criticised by many in the Jewish community for not doing enough to combat a rise in anti-Semitism since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Albanese said the government will seek to introduce legislation that makes it easier to charge people promoting hate speech and violence.
Penalties would be increased, cancelling or refusing visas would be made easier, and a regime for targeting organisations whose leaders engage in hate speech would be developed, he said.
“Australians are shocked and angry. I am angry. It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge much more,” Albanese told a news conference announcing the reforms.



Albanese’s government has said it has consistently denounced anti-Semitism over the last two years.
It passed legislation to criminalise hate speech, and in August, it expelled the Iranian ambassador after accusing Tehran of directing two anti-Semitic arson attacks in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne.
Still, anti-Semitic incidents have been mounting. A 19-year-old Sydney man was charged and will face court on Thursday after allegedly threatening violence towards a Jewish person on a flight from Bali to Sydney on Wednesday.
“Police will allege the man made antisemitic threats and hand gestures indicating violence towards the alleged victim, who the man knew to be affiliated with the Jewish community,” Australian Federal Police said on Thursday.
Youngest victim laid to rest
Yellow toy bees topped the coffin of 10-year-old Matilda, who was remembered as a “ray of sunshine” who loved animals and dancing.
Matilda’s middle name was Bee, which inspired attendees to wear bee stickers, and bee-themed toys and balloons, while some mourners wore yellow. Matilda’s family has asked the media not to use their surname.
“The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter [were] taken from us,” said Rabbi Yehoram Ulman.

 

“Matilda grew up like a child would, loving what children love. She loved the outdoors, animals. She went to school, she had friends, everybody loved her.”
The line outside the hall where Matilda’s funeral was held in Sydney’s eastern suburbs snaked down the street. Many mourners who could not get in watched the service on a screen outside the building.
“It’s like your heart’s been ripped out. It’s terrible … no one wants this,” said Jae Glover, 25, as he handed out bee stickers.
“It’s a feeling, it could have been avoided. Anti-Semitism has now been brewing in Australia for over two years.”
Philippines, Islamic State links investigated
Police allege the attack was carried out by Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed. Sajid was shot dead by police at the scene, while Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences on Wednesday after waking from a coma, including murder and terror charges.
The centre-left Labour government has ruled out holding a Royal Commission, a high-level inquiry with judicial powers, into the shootings for now.
On Wednesday, the leader of New South Wales, where the attack took place, said he would next week recall the state parliament to pass urgent reforms on gun laws.
Police are looking into Australia-based Islamic State networks as well as the gunmen’s alleged links to militants in the Philippines.
The Philippines’ National Security Council on Wednesday said that while Sajid and his son had been in the country for a month in November, the pair had not engaged in any military training.
Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country.
“There is no valid report or confirmation that the two received any form of military training while in the country, and no evidence supports such a claim at present,” Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement.</p><small>2025-12-18 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640084-un-report-clearly-supports-pakistans-position-on-terror-groups-in-afghanistan-fo' target='_blank'><strong>UN report 'clearly supports' Pakistan's position on terror groups in Afghanistan: FO</strong></a><br><p>

At stumps on a sweltering day two, the visitors had ground to 213-8, trailing by 158 after Australia added 45 to their overnight 326-8 as temperatures soared to 40 Celsius.
A gutsy Ben Stokes was not out 45 after facing 151 balls with Jofra Archer on 30 in a Test England must win and on a pitch ideal for batting.

         View this post on Instagram            

They were not helped by another suspect decision by the Snicko technology, but at least avoided the follow-on.
Australia lead the five-match series 2-0 and will retain the urn if they win or draw after back-to-back eight-wicket thumpings in Perth and Brisbane.
Opening pair Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley saw off the early overs from Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins.
But it was a mirage with England losing three wickets for five runs in a 15-ball blitz, the latest chapter in a familiar tale.
Cummins first tempted an edge from Crawley, on nine, to wicketkeeper Alex Carey in the Australian skipper’s first Test since July after lower back issues.
Lyon strikes
Then in a stroke of genius, he brought on spin king Nathan Lyon, who was controversially left out for the pink-ball second Test at the Gabba.
Lyon grabbed two wickets in a sensational opening over with a hapless Ollie Pope (3) flicking to Josh Inglis at midwicket before he bowled Duckett for 29.
Joe Root was fortunate to survive in the next over when he edged Scott Boland to Carey, but a review showed it did not carry.
England’s most experienced player failed to capitalise and was gone in the third over after lunch to Cummins, with Carey collecting another edge.
It was the 12th time Cummins has dismissed Root – more than any other bowler.
With the Ashes on the line, Stokes needed to show what he called “a bit of dog” and he barely flinched when a Starc bouncer dangerously hit the back of his helmet.
He was given the all-clear and set about rescuing the innings before Cameron Green was introduced just before tea and Carey took another catch to remove Harry Brook.
Jamie Smith settled in but departed for 22 when Carey took what Australia claimed was a faint bottom edge off Cummins.
The Snicko showed a small spike despite a gap between bat and ball, with Stokes shaking his head as Smith trudged off.
On day one, Carey starred with an emotional century on his home ground, but it was shrouded in controversy over a Snicko error when he was on 72 and given not out.
England failed to have the decision overturned on review with replays showing a noise spike before the ball reached his bat.
Carey later conceded he likely edged the delivery from Josh Tongue that was caught behind and the technology operator admitted to an error.
“In my view it’s not good enough,” Cricket Australia boss Todd Greenberg said of the technology before play started on Thursday.
“We’re hoping to get some answers so we can be assured it won’t happen again.”
Scott Boland removed Will Jacks (6) and Brydon Carse (0) before Archer dug in with Stokes.
The hosts resumed on the back of Carey’s 106 and a gritty 82 from Usman Khawaja, with Starc on 33 and Lyon yet to score.
Starc plundered five quick fours before being bowled by Archer for 54.
Lyon and Boland then piled on the pain in a 23-run last-wicket stand before Lyon was trapped lbw for nine by Archer, who ended with 5-53.</p><small>2025-12-18 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640064-murree-various-parts-of-punjab-to-witness-rain-snowfall-from-dec-20-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Murree, various parts of Punjab to witness rain, snowfall from Dec 20: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
The year’s last vaccination campaign against the crippling disease was launched by Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on December 11. The week-long campaign, which began on December 15, is aimed at vaccinating over 45m children under the age of five.
According to NEOC, polio drops have been administered to 20.8m children in Punjab, over 7.4m in Sindh, 6.1m in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2.1m in Balochistan, 417,000 in Islamabad, 256,000 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 689,000 children in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the first three days of the campaign.
NEOC said in a statement that over 400,000 polio workers had been going door to door to administer polio drops to children during the vaccination campaign. It called on parents to ensure that their children under five years of age were administered the vaccine.
“The success of the national polio campaign is not possible without the full participation of parents and the community,” NEOC stressed, warning that “polio is an incurable disease that leaves children with lifelong disabilities”.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-18 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18072542f17018a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961730/hottest-country-anywhere-in-rapid-fire-speech-trump-highlights-victories-amid-sinking-approval-ratings' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hottest country anywhere’: In rapid-fire speech, Trump highlights victories amid sinking approval ratings</strong></a><br><p>In a rare evening address from the White House, US President Donald Trump boasted on Wednesday of his accomplishments and blamed his Democratic predecessor for soaring consumer prices as his party braces for a tough midterm election next year.
“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said in a speech that lasted less than 20 minutes and was delivered at rapid-fire pace.
The Republican president, who regularly complains that he does not get credit for his accomplishments, offered few new policy initiatives to address high costs.



Instead, he placed blame at the feet of former president Joe Biden, previous trade deals, immigrants and what he described as a corrupt system.
The Republican president, who regularly complains that he does not get credit for his accomplishments, touted his administration’s work this year on a range of issues from reducing border crossings to bringing down prices of some goods.
Trump announced his administration would send a “warrior dividend” of $1,776 to 1.45 million US service members in the coming week.
He also backed a Republican proposal to send cash directly to the public to offset the cost of health insurance rather than provide subsidies through the Affordable Care Act, a proposal that has yet to receive enough support in Congress.
“I want the money to go directly to the people so you can buy your own healthcare,” Trump said, the room behind him festooned with holiday decor. “The only losers will be the insurance companies.”
Trump gets poor marks on economy
The address offered an opportunity for the president to address people’s concerns about affordability, an issue that Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly referred to as a Democratic hoax.
On Wednesday, while casting blame on Biden’s presidency, Trump conceded that prices remain high while arguing that the nation was “poised” for an economic boom.
“I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast,” he said.
Trump’s Republicans are seeking to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate in November elections next year, while Democrats are highlighting affordability concerns and differences over healthcare policy in an attempt to wrest power away.
High inflation during Biden’s four years in office helped Trump beat former vice president Kamala Harris in last year’s election.
But Trump’s tariff policies this year have created uncertainty and lifted prices in an economy that has now been overseen by his administration for nearly a year — and Trump, like Biden before him, has been struggling to persuade Americans that the economy is healthy.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed just 33pc of US adults approve of how Trump has handled the economy.
Trump’s remarks took place in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room and not the Oval Office as presidential addresses often do.
‘Hottest country anywhere’
In his remarks, Trump said he had attracted $18 trillion in investments that will create jobs and open factories. He credited his tariff policy as a leading factor: “One year ago our country was dead … Now we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world.”
He also said he would announce the next chair of the Federal Reserve soon, someone who believes in lower interest rates, by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further”.
The speech came just a day before a closely watched update on inflation from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
After touching a four-year low of 2.3pc in April just three months into Trump’s second term, annual inflation since then has been grinding higher.
In September — the latest data available because of reporting disruptions caused by the record-long government shutdown — the Consumer Price Index was up 3.0pc year-over-year, the highest since January and higher than at any time during Trump’s first term.
Still, the inflation impact from Trump’s tariffs has not been as significant as many economists had predicted early in his term, with the cost of the import taxes spread among foreign producers, goods importers and end users, including consumers.
Prior to the speech, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, contended that Trump had failed to live up to his campaign promises.
“He promised he’d bring costs down on day one. That was his number-one promise. That was the number-one reason he won the election. And costs are going up and up and up,” Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.</p><small>2025-12-18 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640058-watch-crypto-billionaire-goes-hands-on-with-rickshaw-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Crypto billionaire goes hands-on with rickshaw in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

India’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade said late on Wednesday it had launched a new digital platform last month for companies to generate sponsorship letters to invite foreign professionals, has simplified visa forms and will no longer ask relevant ministries for additional recommendations.
The visas have been eased for factory installation, commissioning, maintenance, and production, among other functions. Indian businesses predominantly depend on Chinese professionals for such services and to train local staff, especially in factories that deploy Chinese machinery.
Reuters reported last week that India has cut red tape to speed up visas for Chinese professionals in signs of improved ties between the two nations.
India had blocked virtually all Chinese visits after the nuclear-armed neighbours clashed on their Himalayan frontier in mid-2020, widening its vetting of business visas beyond the home and foreign ministries.
The removal of red tape comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China this year for the first time in seven years, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and discussing ways to improve ties.
In the face of punishing US tariffs, Modi has cautiously rekindled ties with Beijing.
Think tank the Observer Research Foundation estimates the tougher scrutiny on visas led to production losses of $15 billion over four years to Indian electronics makers, which import key machinery from China.
Major Chinese electronics companies, such as Xiaomi, have also struggled to get visas.

KARACHI: The country’s real‑estate developers on Wednesday alleged that the city’s business community has been facing an unprecedented rise in extortion and harassment cases from organised criminal gangs, and warned that they will shut down their business activity after January 15, 2026, if authorities fail to curb the unchecked reign of fear gripping the city.
The warning by the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad) came only two months after the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati) and All City Traders Ittehad Association had expressed serious concerns about the growing cases of extortion and urged the Sindh government and law enforcement agencies to ensure foolproof security for traders and industrialists.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Abad office-bearers accused criminal networks operating both locally and from abroad of systematically targeting builders, developers and businessmen through extortion calls, threats and shooting incidents.
According to Abad Chairman Muhammad Hassan Bakshi, extortion calls have surged over the past five months, with at least 10 of its association members formally reporting threats.
“We are receiving calls from Iranian and Dubai-based numbers, demanding up to Rs50 million in extortion. Those who refuse are shot at. This is not speculation — it is happening on the ground,” he said.
He alleged that “known criminals,” including Ahmed Ali Magsi, Jameel Chhanga and Wasiullah Lakho, were openly involved in extortion, land grabbing and intimidation.
He said extortionists even send threatening notes, bearing their names, phone numbers and bank account details, yet no effective action has been taken against them. “Sixty cases are already registered against Wasiullah Lakho. The question is why is he still free,” he said, adding that Abad officials had submitted written complaints to President Asif Ali Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh chief minister, leaving “no excuse of ignorance”.
“The law and order is not a favour but a constitutional duty of the state. We can’t understand how five or six individuals are holding Karachi hostage. They are traceable, they are known, yet they are free. If by January 15 the situation does not improve, Abad will be forced to shut down business in Karachi,” he added.
The association’s patron-in-chief, Mohsin Sheikhani, said the real estate section was left with no option but to consider shutting down operations.
The situation, he said, had deteriorated to the point where police appeared “helpless”. He appealed “directly to the army chief to intervene, warning that the economy will collapse” otherwise.
“Unless the federal government takes up this issue and red warrants are issued against extortionists, including those operating from Iran, nothing will change. Our properties, investments and even lives are at stake. If the state cannot protect us, how can we continue doing business?” he asked.
Senior Abad member Syed Afzal Hameed said he had never paid extortion and never would, calling the developing situation a conspiracy to sabotage the economy. He asked the authorities to move “before it’s too late.”
“Karachi’s share in national revenue has already fallen from 62 per cent to 50pc. If real estate collapses, remittances and tax collection will also suffer,” he added.

The request was formally made by Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari to a visiting ADB delegation led by Ms Leah Gutierrez, Director General, Central and West Asia Department though he did not pitch size of the proposed loan to be discussed subsequently. ADB’s total debt stock currently stands at $17bn, the third largest after China and the World Bank.

 

Informed sources told Dawn that the minister proposed that the Manila-based lending agency should come up with financing instruments and arrangements that could directly make power sector debt more affordable through longer payback period and cheaper interest rates than commercial financing from the market. The ADB’s financing and other instruments could also be leveraged to prolong debt-repayment periods.
This would enable the government to avoid budgetary injections and instead finance debt repayments through power tariff at lower than existing rates and help revive power consumption that had been struggling to pickup for years due to unaffordable electricity rates and resultant expansion of the solar revolution, leading to stability challenges to the national grid and power utilities.

Govt requests lender to help stabilise national grid, improve debt affordability, foster private investment

The government had recently contracted around Rs1.25tr from local commercial banks at Kibor minus 0.9pc to replace previous debts but the central bank’s policy rate has since dropped with a similar pathway projects going ahead. The new debt is being financed through a permanent Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on consumers. The government team also sought additional financing for smart metering expansion across distribution companies.
The minister also made a case for increased external support for Pakistan’s contribution towards lowering carbon footprint through solar revolution in the country that had also created challenges to the grid stability. The government team argued that combination of financial support for cheaper debt swaps, smart metering and global environmental contribution could significantly reduce average power rates and help stabilise system through new technologies and demand growth for grid supply.
An official statement confirmed that Mr Leghari “sought ADB’s support in addressing power sector debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors” and briefed the delegation on key challenges facing the power sector.
“He highlighted constraints in financing, issues related to rupee cover, and high upfront costs,” the statement said, adding that the government was engaging local investors through the Pakistan Business Council to attract private investment in the power transmission sector and to improve market visibility.
The minister also explained to the ADB that under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), excess power capacity which was not required in the future had been removed and the government will not procure additional power as it was now moving towards a competitive electricity market.
He said Pakistan had already transitioned around 20GW to clean energy. “However, despite this significant transition, no dedicated financing was provided for the clean energy shift, nor was funding made available to ensure grid stability,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the transition to renewable energy continued despite these limitations.
He emphasised that serious and coordinated efforts, supported by adequate financing, were now required to keep the grid stable. The ADB team was also apprised about the details of the recently introduced Energy Surplus Package to increase electricity demand and encourage higher power offtake by the private sector.
“He requested ADB’s support on the financing side, particularly in addressing debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors,” the statement said.
The minister promised that a feasibility report aimed at private investors will be presented soon.
He also shared that the government was planning the rollout of smart meters through the private sector participation under public-private partnership model, with a focus on technology integration and improved efficiency.

ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity.
The assessment is contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
“The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.

 

The Taliban had pledged under the 2020 Doha Agreement to prevent Afghanistan from being used to threaten other countries. While following their return to power in Aug 2021, they have aggressively targeted Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-K, their stance toward other terrorist groups has been markedly different, according to various UN assessments.
The latest report said “a wide range of member states consistently report that ISIL-K, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Isla­mic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM/TIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Ittiha­dul Mujahideen Pakistan, and others are present in Afghanistan. Some groups have used or are continuing to use Afghanistan to plan and prepare external attacks.”
Al Qaeda is assessed by the United Nations as maintaining close ties with the Taliban, with a persistent presence in several provinces. While its activities are kept low-profile, UN monitors say the group benefits from a permissive environment that allows training and reorganisation. By contrast, ISIL-K is considered the Taliban’s primary adversary. Taliban operations have degraded its territorial control, but the group has remained resilient, carrying out attacks inside Afghan­istan and abroad.
The most acute threat to regional stability, however, is seen as the TTP, which the UN report describes as enjoying strong support from elements within the Taliban and operating from Afghan sanctuaries.
“Taliban authorities continue to deny and deflect responsibility for failing to restrain TTP,” the report said. “Within the Taliban there are varying degrees of sympathy for and allegiance with TTP.”

 

“Some senior members increasingly view TTP as a liability, unnecessarily disrupting and antagonising relations with Pakistan, while others remain supportive of it,” the report said. Assessing the likelihood of the Taliban severing ties with the group under Pakistani pressure, the report said, “Given the historical ties, the Taliban are unlikely to confront or act against TTP.” It added, “Even should they wish to, they may lack the ability to do so.”
According to the report, the TTP has conducted “numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil”, making it the most serious immediate challenge to relations between Kabul and Islamabad.
“The number of TTP attacks in Pakistan has been increasing throughout 2025,” the report said. “By some estimates, there have already been more than 600 attacks in Pakistan in 2025.”
It added that “many attacks have been complex in nature, involving multiple, coordinated attackers using methods such as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, combined with teams of suicide attackers on foot”, and noted that “a majority of those conducting suicide bombings in Pakistan were reported to be Afghans”.
Pakistan has long accused the Taliban of harbouring TTP fighters, estimated by the UN report at about 6,000. These TTP fighters are said to be living in Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika and Paktia with the group’s chief Noor Wali Mehsud, reportedly living in Kabul.
An unnamed member state was said to have reported that the family of Mehsud received a monthly payment of three million afghanis (roughly $43,000) from Taliban.
The dispute over the presence of TTP in Afghanistan has severely strained ties between the two neighbours, though the Afghan Taliban were once considered to be closely allied with Pakistan.
“These attacks have led to cross-border military confrontation, causing a number of casualties, as well as disruptions to bilateral trade,” the report said. “At the time of writing, in addition to the loss of life, the closure of border crossings with Pakistan is estimated to cost the Afghan economy around $1 million per day.” The monitoring team said TTP has expanded its targeting.
“In January, TTP issued a new directive expanding targets of its attacks to include military-owned businesses,” the report said, “thereby significantly escalating its focus on the economic interests of the military of Pakistan and of Chinese enterprises in Pakistan.” It also pointed to cooperation between TTP and other terrorist groups.
Despite the broader militant presence, the report noted some counterterrorism progress made by Pakistan.
“There have also been a number of high-profile arrests by the Pakistani authorities, such as the arrest of an ISIL-K spokesperson, Sultan Aziz Azam, on 16 May 2025,” it said.
“Overall, the capability of ISIL-K has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations by the de facto authorities and Pakistan,” the report added, noting that “the arrest in mid-2025 by Turkish and Pakistani authorities of Ozgur Altun, known as Abu Yasir al-Turki, a key figure in the group’s media and logistical operations, may have contributed to the suspension of ‘Voice of Khorasan’.”
On Al Qaeda, the report said, “In March 2025, Osama Mahmoud was formally declared ‘emir’ of AQIS. He comes from Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”

Nisar Hussain Jafri, chairman of the Pakistan Goods Transporters Allia­nce (PGTA), which represents around 20 major transport associations across the country, told Dawn that the government had accepted the group’s major demands and goods’ movement had resumed.
Earlier, PGTA President Malik Shehzad Awan announced the decision at a press conference at the Gulbai Truck Stand in Karachi along with Punjab Transport Minister Bilal Akbar and Murtaza Wahab, representing the Sindh government. He said the strike was being withdrawn on assurances given by the authorities.
“We have called off the strike after it continued for 10 days. The decision was taken after the federal, Punjab and Sindh governments accepted our demands and signed the settlement document,” said Mr Awan.
He said the authorities had agreed to substantially reduce fines and resolve issues related to axle-load limits, the issuance of heavy transport driving licences, disputes with Customs authorities and the motorway police, and controversial provisions of the amended Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
As part of the commitments, the meeting also decided the temporary allocation of 50 acres for truck parking opposite the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road under the administrative control of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). It was also agreed that around 600 acres on the Northern Bypass (M-10) would be acquired from the Sindh government and earmarked for parking to ease congestion.
The decisions included construction of a 6km stretch of the Northern Bypass by April 2026, with the remaining portion to be completed subsequently. To further facilitate port traffic, the National Highway Authority plans to expand the route to six lanes, and a detailed design will be finalised by March 2026.
On reports of container-theft gangs stealing goods from import containers, the settlement also envisaged action by the Sindh police, with the provincial inspector general tasked with investigating the complaints and taking strict action against those involved.
All Pakistan Truck Trailer Owners Association Chairman Lala Yasir Naseer confirmed that freight movement had resumed following the announcement. “After being informed by our alliance, we have conveyed instructions to our members to resume business activities,” he told Dawn.
Transporters had gone on strike over what they described as excessive fines and had demanded the withdrawal of the Traffic Ordinance 2025.
Mr Akbar said heavy fines and the registration of FIRs against transporters had been abolished. He added that fitness certificates issued in Karachi would be recognised in Punjab and would be valid for six months.
He said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had directed that truck stands be built in cities across the province, along with rest areas for drivers.
Mr Wahab, who is also Karachi’s mayor, said the Sindh government had taken transporters into confidence before making decisions affecting them.
Talks between goods transporters and representatives of the Punjab and Sindh governments, the Customs department and the Ministry of Communications were held on Tuesday but remained inconclusive.
Mr Jafri said a fresh meeting was held on Wednesday at the Customs House in Karachi, attended by the same government side and joined via video link by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, Port and Shipping Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani.
Industrialists said the strike had begun in Punjab on Dec 8, with protests in cities including Rawalpindi and Lahore led by the Punjab Public Transport Association and the Goods Transporters Association against the provincial government’s enforcement of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
They said the ordinance introduced sharply increased fines and penalties for traffic violations such as speeding, overloading and operating older vehicles, which transporters deemed an unbearable financial burden.
Industrialists estimated the textile sector alone incurred losses of around $500 million over the past 10 days, while stranded consignments attracted demurrage and detention charges at ports and factory premises.
They said production lines were forced to slow down or shut down due to disruptions in the supply of raw materials and the dispatch of finished goods, raising the risk of missed vessel sailings and cancellations of international orders.
The strike also affected the movement of industrial inputs from seaports to factories across the country.
