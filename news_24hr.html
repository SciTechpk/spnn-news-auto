MOHAMMAD Yasin

ISLAMABAD: The upcoming UK-Pakistan Trade Dia­logue will prioritise reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to enha­nce bilateral trade, British trade envoy to Pakistan Mohammad Yasin said.
“We’re launching the UK-Pakistan Trade Dialo­gue — a structured ministerial platform focused on reducing non-tariff barriers through practical cooperation, technical support, and regulatory alignment,” he said in a written interview with Dawn.
He expressed the hope that the dialogue would help accelerate progress in strengthening trade ties between the two countries.
Mr Yasin visited Pakistan last week to lay the groundwork for the trade dialogue, which is set to begin later this year. During his visit, he held meetings focused on investment opportunities, regulatory cooperation, and enhancing business-to-business linkages, particularly in high-value sectors such as tech­­­nology and pharmaceuticals.

British envoy hopes upcoming dialogue will help accelerate progress in strengthening bilateral ties

The dialogue aims to unlock the full potential of the bilateral trade relationship, which currently stands at £4.7 billion. It is intended to address persistent challenges in the business environment, diversify Pakistan’s export base, and improve market access to sectors beyond traditional textiles, including clean energy, digital services, and value-added manufacturing.
 
 

Key NTBs hampering Pakistan-UK trade include stringent UK technical standards, especially in textiles and pharmaceuticals, that many Pakistani small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to meet due to the high costs of certifications. Add­itional barriers include sanitary and phytosanitary measures complicating agricultural exports, complex post-Brexit customs procedures leading to delays, and growing UK consumer demands for sustainably and ethically sourced products.
On Pakistan’s end, inefficient export procedures and infrastructure bottlenecks further impede trade. While Pakistani pro­ducts enjoy duty-free access under the UK’s Developing Countries Tra­ding Scheme, these non-tariff obstacles continue to limit growth, particularly in high-value sectors, preventing businesses from fully benefiting from the scheme.
Commenting on the prospects of a free trade agreement (FTA), Mr Yasin said: “While  FTAs require significant resources and time, this dialogue allows us to make faster, targeted progress on the issues that matter most to exporters to support growth. This work complements both countries’ economic priorities.”
There is currently no bilateral FTA between Pakistan and the UK. However, officials view the trade dialogue as a pragmatic step toward aligning standards and facilitating smoother market entry, potentially laying the foundation for a future agreement.
 
 

Mr Yasin also emphasised the UK’s commitment to supporting Pakistani SMEs, particularly in the tech sector. “We’re working through the UK’s REMIT programme to improve the business environment, enhance access to finance, and support digital transformation,” he said.
While noting that Pakistan’s tech and digital services sectors are among the most dynamic in its economy, the envoy said that the UK “wants to see more Pakistani tech companies use the UK as a springboard to access wider European and global markets”.
He highlighted the role of British development finance institutions in this effort. British International Investment is actively investing in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion, while UK Export Finance supports Pakistani firms seeking to expand exports or partner with the UK companies.
The UK is leveraging its development finance tools, Mr Yasin said, to help Pakistani firms expand their exports or partner with the UK companies.
Mr Yasin, however, parried questions about the impact of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor on UK-Pakistan trade and how the UK navigates geopolitical considerations while advancing economic cooperation with Pakistan.

The delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, is scheduled to hold talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and senior officials from other departments.
Talks between Pakistan and the United States, which have been ongoing for over a month, are expected to conclude this week, the Finance Ministry stated on Wednesday following a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
The ongoing discussions, centred on reciprocal tariffs are part of a broader effort to “reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments,” according to Pakistani officials.
The finance ministry also noted that “a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.”
Pakistan currently faces a 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US. In 2024, Pakistan’s trade surplus with the United States was around $3 billion.
To ease tariff pressures and address the trade imbalance, Islamabad has offered to increase imports of American goods, including crude oil and expand investment opportunities for US firms, particularly in its mining sector.
“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the ministry said.
Last week, the two governments co-hosted a webinar to promote investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, highlighting the $7 billion Reko Diq copper-gold project in Balochistan.
Senior officials and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms aimed at attracting foreign capital.
The US Export-Import Bank is currently reviewing financing proposals worth between $500 million and $1bn for the Reko Diq project.
In an interview with Fox Business, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration is negotiating trade deals with 18 “important trading partners” and expects several of them to be finalised in the coming weeks.
“If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 … then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labour Day,” Mr Bessent said, indicating a more flexible timeline than the previously set July 9 deadline.
President Trump has already claimed he used trade as a leverage to stop hostilities between Pakistan and India in May.
US officials have said finalising trade agreements with both India and Pakistan could provide a much-needed stabilising influence and offer a path toward broader economic cooperation.
Published in Dawn, July 1st, 2025</p><small>2025-07-01 04:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921329/terrorist-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist threat</strong></a><br><p>WHETHER terrorist groups have external help or are operating with local support, far too many security personnel and civilians have lost their lives in heinous attacks that show no sign of abating.
The latest atrocity occurred on Saturday, when 13 soldiers were martyred in a suicide attack in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area. The unfortunate fact is that the former Fata districts, as well as the rest of KP, along with Balochistan, form Pakistan’s soft underbelly, where terrorist groups — religiously inspired ones and separatists, respectively — seem to operate with impunity.
According to data compiled by the PICSS think tank for May, there were 85 militant attacks in that month, resulting in at least 113 fatalities, mostly of security men and civilians. These are alarmingly high numbers for peacetime. It indicates that Pakistan’s counterterrorism policy needs to be retooled so that lives are saved and terrorist groups neutralised.
The military has said that the Mir Ali attack was planned by “the terrorist state of India” and carried out by “Fitna al-Khawarij”, the term it uses for the banned TTP. Meanwhile, Asood al-Harb, a little-known outfit linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, has claimed responsibility for the deadly ambush.
When it comes to names and nomenclature, it should be kept in mind that terrorist groups keep changing monikers. What remains unchanged, though, is their nefarious intent to wage war against the state. The shadowy networks of militancy must be uprooted, while their supporters — both local and foreign — must be exposed.
If India is involved, it should be firmly told through diplomatic channels to cease such destabilising activities. Evidence of its support for terrorism must be brought before the international community, including the UN.
Similarly, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan must be warned that improvement in relations and support for the TTP cannot go hand in hand. The Taliban administration has said that Pakistan’s claims of India misusing Afghan territory to destabilise this country are “baseless”.
However, it should be remembered that a recent significant UN report on militancy released in February very clearly stated that the Afghan Taliban continue their support for the TTP.
 
 

It is true that, since then, there has been an improvement in Pak-Afghan relations, thanks to Chinese mediation, and both countries have upgraded diplomatic ties. Yet if terrorist attacks continue in the border areas, Pakistan will have reason to ask questions, unless Kabul takes firm action against all militant groups that threaten this country from Afghan soil.
While raising the issue of militancy with our neighbours is important, reinforcing our own CT programme is crucial. The writ of the state must be established in all areas so that terrorists no longer threaten civilians or target troops.
Published in Dawn, July 1st, 2025</p><small>2025-07-01 04:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/686324605dfc2.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921327/meet-zohran-kwame-mamdani' target='_blank'><strong>Meet Zohran Kwame Mamdani</strong></a><br><p>HIS rise has been swift and vertical. Donald Trump, among others, is struggling to figure out who exactly Zohran Kwame Mamdani is. They know that the newly elected Democratic mayoral candidate for New York in the Nov 4 elections stands for the liberation of Palestine.
They probably also know that he accuses Narendra Modi of mass murder in Gujarat, even if India’s supreme court has given him the proverbial clean chit for the 2002 carnage of Muslims.
In a pre-election interview, mayoral candidates were asked if they would help the Indian prime minister hold another rally in the city. All said no, but Mamdani went on to emphasise that he would never wish to meet Modi if elected mayor of New York.
Zohran should not perhaps worry about that possibility if reports are true about the possible resignation of Modi in September, when he attains the retirement age of 75 that he set for all BJP office bearers.
 
 

But Mamdani’s critics (and many supporters) don’t quite seem to know how or why he succeeded in toppling the Democratic Party’s applecart by upstaging its poster boy Andrew Cuomo in the race. Cuomo’s elitist supporters include Zionist Jews from Brooklyn, who reportedly helped mobilise a whopping $25 million to defeat Mamdani.
They are naturally worried by the turn of events. Mamdani’s reply to them was reassuring, even disarming. Hate crimes trouble him equally, including the current antisemitic uptick across the US. His pledge to them was his proposal for an 800 per cent increase in the city’s mayoral budget to arrest hate-crimes.
Trump, nevertheless, has called him a communist lunatic, and reports are coming in of assassination threats to the 33-year-old Ugandan migrant with a winsome smile.
To appreciate Zohran’s secular and progressive Hindu and Muslim lineage, it might help to look for a clue in his middle name, Kwame. The one Kwame his parents possibly named him after, and who best fits the sketchy political profile we have of the Mamdanis, is Kwame Nkrumah.
The radical left politician led Ghana to independence from Britain but was overthrown after a short tenure as president by a Western-backed military coup while he was visiting China in 1966. Nkrumah, together with Patrice Lumumba, Kenneth Kaunda and Julius Nyerere, was an idol for post-colonial masses in Africa and beyond. South Asians saw him as a genuine friend, and Jawaharlal Nehru courted him as a comrade. Some say he was the inspiration for Martin Luther King’s doctrine of peaceful resistance.

To appreciate Zohran’s secular and progressive Hindu and Muslim lineage, it might help to look for a clue in his middle name.

We also know that Zohran was born in Kampala, where his father of Gujarati Shia Muslim origins, began his journey as a scholar with a focus on colonialism, ethnic strife and migration. Mahmood Mamdani has written outstanding books on colonialism and society, a more widely lauded being Good Muslim, Bad Muslim. To get a handle on the phenomenon, his son is, we may benefit from discussing his father’s scholarly quest.
In Good Muslim, Bad Muslim, Mamdani discusses the rise of political Islam, and answers questions that Americans have struggled with since Osama bin Laden, the former American protégé, staged a spectacular attack on the US. Mamdani dispels the easy description of ‘good’ Muslims being secular or Westernised and the ‘bad’ being slotted as pre-modern and fanatical. In his view, political Islam emerged from a modern encounter with the West. The terrorist movement at the centre of political Islam is an even more recent phenomenon, one “that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam”.
 
 

The book seems relevant to today’s perceptions of the Israel-Iran contest. Amid the megaphoned Western vilification of ‘mullahs’ ruling Iran, a 5,000-year-old civilisation is condemned by its parvenue rivals who were largely created from the British-French division of spoils following Turkey’s defeat in 1919. Look carefully, and all the post-Cold War Western targets were utterly secular states — from Iraq to Libya, from Algeria to Syria, and from Lebanon to Yemen. Damned if you are secular, damned if you are not.
Mamdani’s other acclaimed works include a signal point of departure in analysing the ethnic violence in Rwanda. Another work, Neither Settler nor Native: The Making and Unmaking of Permanent Minorities posits that the modern state didn’t begin with the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, but sprang into being in 1492: the year of the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain following the ‘Reconquista’, which coincided with the European colonisation of the Americas.
Zohran’s mother, Mira Nair, is a progressive filmmaker. Some of her acclaimed movies are seen in their approach as a facet of parallel cinema. Monsoon Wedding, Mississippi Masala, The Namesake are more widely applauded, though her cinematic work on life in the slums of Uganda is a class apart.
Nair’s films are known for their vibrant storytelling, rich cultural textures and exploration of identity, displacement and human connections. The parents’ imprint is palpable in the son’s politics.
What makes his win even more remarkable is that Zohran “has refused to back down from his vocal support for Palestinian liberation, a position that has long been a death knell for candidates within a party whose establishment is unabashedly pro-Israel,” said The Guardian.
There are other compelling factors driving Mamdani’s success. His approach to New York differs from Frank Sinatra’s individualistic quest to arrive at “the top of the heap”. Zohran takes a leaf, instead, from Sahir Ludhianvi’s angst for Bombay. “Cheen o Arab hamara, Hindosta’n hamara/ Rehne ko ghar nahi hai, saara jahaa’n hamara.” (The far corners of the world belong to me, and I am its homeless citizen.)
Like Sahir, Mamdani identifies with “those who toil in the nights, so they can enjoy the fruits of their labour in the day. Where eight hours on the factory floor or behind the wheels of a cab is enough to pay the mortgage, enough to keep the lights on, enough to send your kids to school”.

In doing so, some have pointed out, the newly minted bench of the Supreme Court has delivered what it was meant to.
Lengthy articles will appear in the coming days, as will long monologues on television, explaining the legal intricacies behind this decision, referencing articles, sections and subsections of the law and the Constitution, which will make no sense to those of us without legal degrees.
However, the rest of us will continue to wonder how the blue-eyed parties can end up with seats for which they have no corresponding strength in parliament in terms of directly elected seats.
After all, the reserved seats are allocated on the basis of the directly elected seats won by a party (which it seems the PTI is not). This was succinctly pointed out by journalist Majid Nizami on X, who wrote that the PML-N has three directly elected seats from KP but the party will get five reserved seats for women from the province; the JUI-F has two MNAs but will get three reserved seats; and the PPP will get two when it has only one directly elected MNA.
Ordinary people will not really be able to figure out this mathematical equation but they are aware of a simpler principle of Pakistan’s history: this decision has followed the time-honoured tradition of our courts, where politics (and power) trumps legalese, rather than the other way around.
Indeed, for months now, the messengers on television screens had been informing less-informed mortals that the PTI was never going to get the reserved seats. And it wasn’t because the PTI would then gain some super powers and be in a position to push back. Nope.
This decision was never about the PTI. It was about giving the ruling alliance a two-thirds majority. Best to avoid the kind of tamasha and to-ing and fro-ing that accompanied the 26th Amendment; so much petrol and air-conditioning is wasted as meetings are held and allies and/ or other parties are cajoled to vote with the government. In this time of austerity, such expenses are best not incurred.

Just when we think there is nothing more to reveal they shed another fig leaf.

And so much money will be saved as more of the planned legislation will now go through at lightning speed. The menu is extensive, we are told. From providing a legal cover to the hybrid system, to sprinkling some executive glitter on someone’s sheer power, to rolling back the 18th Amendment, there is no end to the predictions. The talk is as varied as there are mouths, goes the Urdu saying. It also holds true of what will now pass from parliament in the coming days and months.
Neither is the plan simply to push through legislation. The canals might be back with a bang, while there is also talk of sending the PTI government in KP home, in a move reminiscent of the 2022 vote of no-confidence. Decisions will now be made because they can; reaction and public anger will prove to be no hurdle. We are in an ‘I am on top of the world looking down…’ moment.
No one doubts it, and there is little resistance. The political parties gave up a long time ago. Ordinary people, on the other hand, are exhausted, partly from economic pressures and partly from the violence, or the threat of it, inflicted on them. If in the PTI, Imran Khan, his wife and leaders such as Yasmin Rashid have now been behind bars for months and years, no one expects this to change soon.
In Balochistan, Mahrang Baloch has been silenced, and there is little outrage over this, while Ali Wazir, too, appears to be a case of out of sight, out of mind. Manzoor Pashteen, on the other hand, has disappeared into oblivion.
No wonder then that those in power think they can get away with anything. And just when we think there is nothing more to reveal they shed another fig leaf. The obscene salary hikes they awarded themselves in the budget were still being discussed when this judgement was announced.
 
 

This happened while terrorist attacks are once again in the news cycle. Half of the country appears to be beyond the writ of the state, and there are deaths from attacks, the effects of climate change and even poverty, but they should keep quiet because there might be another attack by India.
There is little left to say as the powerless brace themselves for what is to come. For come it will; a legacy that the state and society will grapple with for decades.
The 1980s left us with a jihad factory and violence from non-state actors that continue to be a challenge. The noughties left us with a newer breed of jihadis, along with a real estate juggernaut and wounds in Balochistan that are now infected. What next?
Lastly, it is also necessary to remember that once power is consolidated, the slow journey to weakening also begins. Back in 2002, it seemed as if no one could stop the US, as after the quick and successful invasion of Afghanistan it blithely entered Iraq in order to reshape the Middle East.
While the region continues to pay the price of that adventure, the story of the weakening of the world’s superpower can also be traced back to those years.
Closer to home, once the PML-N had staved off the PTI dharna, it seemed as if there would not be a popular challenge to the party in Punjab. Then came Panama.
The PPP’s rule in Sindh seemed unassailable — until recently, when the canals were announced. And similarly placed was Pervez Musharraf in the summer of 2006 when the Supreme Court struck down the Steel Mills privatisation. One never knows what is lurking around the corner.

This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the 15-member body and its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan’s Permanent Rep­resentative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, noted the challenges that define the current international landscape.
“Pakistan is going to assume the presidency of the United Nations Security Council at a time of global tumult marked by growing instability, escalating conflicts, complex geopolitical and geostrategic landscape, and serious threats to international peace and security,” he said.
 






A familiar role
While the presidency rotates monthly and does not carry executive authority, it allows the presiding country to influence the Council’s agenda and tone — a platform that matters at a time when the UNSC is increasingly seen as deadlocked, especially on issues like Gaza and Ukra­i­­ne. With global trust in multilateral mechanisms under strain, Pakistan’s leadership — even if brief — will be closely watched.
The ambassador underscored Pakis­tan’s commitment to its long-held positions on peaceful conflict resolution. “Pakistan has been a staunch and consistent advocate of dialogue and diplomacy… We will bring a principled and balanced perspective to the work of the Security Council,” he said, pledging to strengthen multilateralism and deepen cooperation with other UNSC members. “We seek to promote transparency, incl­u­sivity and responsiveness during Pakis­tan’s presidency,” said Ambassador Ahmad.  “We will closely work with other Cou­ncil members in a spirit of cooperation for collective and timely action… in line with the UN Charter and corresponding to the exp­ectations of the international community.”

In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs10.39 per litre (four per cent) to Rs272.98 per litre from Rs262.59. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rate.
The ex-depot price of petrol was set at Rs266.79 per litre against Rs258.43, up by Rs8.36 or 3.3pc. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.

Petrol to be sold for Rs266.79/litre; HSD to cost Rs272.98/litre; LPG rate cut by Rs7.51/kg

 
 

At present, the government is charging about Rs100 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, with fresh imposition of Rs2.5 per litre climate support levy with effect from July 1. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government is also charging about Rs19 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
LPG price cut
On the other hand, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1pc for the month of July. Ogra notified the new price for 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,750.60 for July against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.
As compared to previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP price has decreased by 4.29pc, while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.47pc, resulting in a decline in the LPG consumer price by Rs88.71 per 11.8kg cylinder (3.1pc).

GAZA: Women grieve amidst the rubble of Yaffa School, which was destroyed in Israeli strikes.—AFP

• Over 60 killed, including two dozen at seafront rest area; school sheltering refugees also targeted
• IDF admits ‘harming civilians’ at aid sites; claims new orders issued after ‘lessons learned’
• Israeli minister in Washington for talks, Netanyahu due to meet Trump soon for renewed peace push
GAZA / WASHINGTON: Israeli forces killed at least 60 people on Monday — in one of the deadliest days in weeks — as Israeli officials headed to Washington for a renewed diplomatic push to secure a ceasefire and the release of prisoners.
Following the resolution of Israel’s 12-day war with Iran, hopes for a halt to the fighting in Gaza have been revived, where more than 20 months of incessant bombing have created dire humanitarian conditions for the population of more than two million.
US President Donald Trump has recently urged Israel to “make the deal in Gaza”, while key mediator Qatar said Monday that “momentum” had been created by the truce with Iran last week.
But on the ground, Israel has continued to press its offensive across the Palestinian territory.
According to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 21 people were in a strike on a seafront rest area.
“The place is always crowded with people because the rest area offers drinks, family seating and internet access,” eyewitness Ahmed Al-Nayrab, 26, told AFP, recalling a “huge explosion that shook the area”.
 
 

“I saw body parts flying everywhere, and bodies cut and burned… It was a scene that made your skin crawl.” Another eyewitness, Bilal Awkal, 35, said “blood covered the ground and screams filled the air”.
“Women and children were everywhere, like a scene from a movie about the end of the world.”
Photojournalist Ismail Abu Hatab was among those killed in the strike.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 27 others were killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across Gaza, including “11 people killed near aid distribution points in the central and southern parts of the territory”.
Eyewitnesses and local authorities have reported repeated killings of Palestinians near distribution centres in recent weeks, after Israel began allowing in a trickle of aid at the end of May.
Samir Abu Jarbou, 28, told AFP by phone that he had gone with relatives to pick up food in an area of central Gaza around midnight.
“Suddenly, the (Israeli) army opened fire, and drones started shooting. We ran away and got nothing,” he said.
In the southern city of Khan Yunis, the dead and wounded were rushed to a hospital in an open-top trailer after aid seekers said they were fired on by Israeli forces in nearby Rafah.
“The targeting was deliberate, aimed at people as they were leaving,” eyewitness Aboud al-Adwi told AFP.
“There was no one among us who was wanted or posed any threat. We were all civilians, simply trying to get food for our children,” he added.
IDF admission
In a significant development, the Israeli military acknowledged on Monday that Palestinian civilians were harmed at aid distribution centres in the Gaza Strip, saying that Israeli forces had been issued new instructions following what it called “lessons learned”.
Since Israel lifted an 11-week aid blockade on Gaza on May 19, allowing limited deliveries to resume, the United Nations says more than 400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking handouts of aid.
“Following incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted in the Southern Command and instructions were issued to forces in the field following lessons learned,” an Israeli military spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement said incidents in which Gaza civilians were harmed were under review.
It followed a Friday report in Israel’s Haaretz newspaper that Israel’s Military Advocate Gener­al had ordered an investigation into possible war crimes over allegations that Israeli forces deliberately fired at Palestinian civilians near the sites.
The spokesperson had no immediate comment on a Times of Israel report on Monday, citing the military, that artillery shelling intended to deter Palestinians from approaching certain zones near aid distribution centres had been inaccurate in at least three instances, resulting in 30-40 casualties, including several fatalities.
Ceasefire push
US President Donald Trump had said last week that he was hoping for a new ceasefire “within the next week”, and is reportedly pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the Gaza war.
Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari told journalists on Monday that “momentum” had been created by the Iran-Israel ceasefire on June 24.
“We won’t hold our breath for this to happen today and tomorrow, but we believe that the elements are in place to push forward towards restarting the talks,” he added.
 
 

Meanwhile, Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is due to hold talks at the White House this week, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit the White House on July 7 for talks with President Donald Trump.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leav­itt said earlier that Netanyahu had “expressed interest” in what would be his third meeting with Trump since the Republican returned to power in January.
“I know that Mr Dermer is in Washington this week to meet with senior officials here at the White House,” she told reporters.
The spokeswoman said Trump’s “priority” was to “end this brutal war in Gaza”.
“It’s heartbreaking to see the images that have come out from both Israel and Gaza throughout this war, and the president wants to see it end,” Leavitt added.
Separately, Washington has announced the approval of a $510 million sale to Israel of bomb guidance kits and related support, after Israel expended significant munitions in its recent conflict with Iran.

In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading part-ners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.
For June, inflation is expected to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.
On the external front, rising remittances and exports are expected to keep the current account in surplus during FY25.
From July to May FY25, the current account posted a surplus of $1.8bn, in stark contrast to a deficit of $1.6bn during the same period last year.

Remittances, export growth and fiscal discipline drive economic optimism

Goods exports rose 4pc to $29.7bn, while imports increased 11.5pc to $54.1bn, widening the trade deficit to $24.4bn from $20bn a year earlier. Key export gains were seen in knitwear (14.5pc), garments (16.4pc), and bedwear (10.6pc). Major import increases were recorded in palm oil (26.3pc) and electrical machinery (13.6pc), while crude oil imports declined 1.7pc.
Service exports grew 8.5pc to $7.6bn, with imports rising 6.6pc to $10.3bn, resulting in a $2.7bn services trade deficit. IT exports surged by 18.7pc to $3.5bn.
Worker remittances saw a sharp increase of 28.8pc, reaching $34.9bn from $27.1bn in the same period last year, led by higher inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at $2bn, slightly down from $2.1bn a year ago.
China remained the top investor with $790.4m, followed by the UK with $229m and Hong Kong with $215.2m. The financial services sector attracted the most FDI at $628.9m, followed by power ($562.8m) and oil & gas exploration ($265.6m).
However, foreign portfolio investment recorded net outflows, with $312.5m from the private sector and $311.9m from the public sector. As of June 13, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $17bn, including $11.7bn held by the State Bank of Pakistan.
On the fiscal side, the report noted that revenue growth outpaced expenditure growth during July-April FY25, reflecting the success of the government’s fiscal consolidation drive.
The fiscal deficit declined to 3.2pc of GDP, down from 4.5pc in the same period last year, while the primary surplus improved to 3.2pc of GDP from 1.5pc a year earlier.

• Says Pakistan charting forward-looking course as world transforms from unipolar to multipolar
• FO welcomes The Hague court award, calls on New Delhi to resume treaty implementation
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains deter­mined to protect its rights and entitlements under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and firmly rejects India’s attempts to weaponise water for its narrow geopolitical objectives, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office also called on India to resume the functioning of the treaty, which it has held in abeyance since May.
Speaking at the 52nd Foundation Day ceremony of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), Mr Dar said India’s illegal and unilateral action of putting the treaty “in abeyance” has no validity. He further said the mettle of the nation was tested again recently — with India’s unfounded allegations following the Pahalgam attack, and its unprovoked aggression in May 2025.
Islamabad swiftly retaliated to the Delhi’s escalation with a “quid pro quo plus” response — which is the “new normal” set by Pakistan if India insists on its dangerous notion of “limited war under the nuclear threshold”, he said.
‘Hinge moment’
The foreign minister further said Pakistan values the efforts of all friendly countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Türkiye that resulted in preventing further escalation with India and putting the ceasefire in place.
“Going forward, it is essential to consolidate the ceasefire, institute a reliable crisis management mechanism, and develop confidence-building measures that would help stabilise the regional security situation,” he remarked.
 
 

“It is our considered view that sustainable peace in South Asia remains contingent on a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.”
Mr Dar said the world was passing through another “hinge” moment in history. He said the profound transformation was taking place in the world order and the globe was witnessing changes unseen in a century.
The peaceful rise of China, attempts to ‘contain’ China’s rise, resurgence of Russia, increasing salience of Eurasia in global geopolitics, emergence of ‘Middle Powers’, and the growing role of the ‘Global South’ are some of the prominent features of this transitional phase, he remarked.
He said that amidst global turbulence and transformation, from unipolar world to a multipolar one, Pakistan is charting a forward-looking course as a confident and self-assured nation.
Gaza and Iran
He observed that Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza continues to be a stain on the conscience of humanity.
“The wanton killing of children and women, use of starvation as an instrument of war, mass destruction of homes, schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure, and deliberate targeting of humanitarian workers have no parallels in history.”
“These actions are beyond condemnation,” he said.
“We condemned Israel’s completely unjustified aggression against Iran as well as the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities by the US”.
Mr Dar further said these actions, representing a highly dangerous escalation, have been in violation of the UN charter and international law.
He said Islamabad has consistently supported Iran’s legitimate right to self-defence under the Charter. “We appreciate the constructive and pragmatic approach that Iran adopted in finding a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue.”
Positive trajectory
He said that in recent months, Pakistan has purposefully made efforts to reset its relations with Afghanistan on a positive trajectory.
“Among other things, we agreed to upgrade our diplomatic representation to ambassadorial level and extend CPEC to Afghanistan,” he said.
 
 

“Having made sincere efforts in Afghanistan’s interest, it is our legitimate expectation that the Afghan interim government would take all steps necessary to ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is not used for terrorism against any state, particularly Pakistan.
India urged to restore IWT
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) has welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to issue a “supplemental award” on its case over the Indus Waters Treaty.
“In a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,” the FO said.
“The Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India’s illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.”
The FO urged India to “immediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.”

• Decries conduct of IAEA chief
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it “since we totally obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.
“I am not offering Iran ANYTHING, unlike Obama,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Nor am I even talking to them since we totally OBLITERATED their Nuclear Facilities.”
 

screengrab from Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump

The statement comes as Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the BBC that talks between Washington and Tehran cannot resume unless the US rules out further strikes on Iran.
Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the British broadcaster that the US had signalled it wants to return to the negotiating table, a week after it struck three Iranian nuclear facilities. “We have not agreed to any date, we have not agreed to the modality,” said Takht-Ravanchi.
“Right now we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?” The US needs to be “quite clear on this very important question”, he said.
The two countries were in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme when Israel hit Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 21.
The deputy minister revealed to the BBC that the US had signalled it did “not want to engage in regime change” by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Takht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium. “The level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,” he said.
 
 

‘Destructive’ behaviour
Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that Tehran halted cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog due to what he called the agency chief’s “destructive” behaviour towards the Islamic republic, his office said on Monday.
“The action taken by parliament members… is a natural response to the unjustified, unconstructive, and destructive conduct of the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency,” Pezeshkian told Macron in a phone call late Sunday, according to a presidency statement.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the Iranian parliament’s decision to halt cooperation with the IAEA reflected the “concern and anger of the Iranian public opinion”.
He further criticised the United States and European powers for maintaining what he described as a “political approach” toward Iran’s nuclear programme during his weekly press conference.
Baqaei also questioned how the safety of IAEA inspectors could be ensured while the extent of the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities — targeted by Israel and the United States during the 12-day war — remains unknown.
“One aspect of this issue is how to ensure the safety and security of the agency’s inspectors, in a situation where there is still no accurate assessment of the severity of the damage,” he said.
On Wednesday, Iranian lawmakers voted in favour of a bill to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, citing Israel’s June 13 attack and later strikes by the US on nuclear facilities.

For years, residents of this town have relied on the neighbouring country for daily use items, mainly because it is too far from regular supply chain routes.
Located around 700km from Quetta with only a rudimentary road link, the town with a population of around 67,000 has historically been dependent on trade with Iran to meet even its most basic needs.
Earlier, locals would purchase edible items from Jalk, the nearest Iranian town, located around 20km from Mashkhel.
But the Zero Point gate with Iran has been closed since the Covid-19 pandemic.

Locals forced to purchase Iranian goods from Quetta at triple the price

“We were compelled to get edible items from either Dalbandin (in neighbouring Chaghi district) or from Quetta,” says Kabir Ahmad Reki, a local.
In the absence of formal trade, people from the area are forced to use ‘unofficial’ routes to obtain essentials from the Iranian side. Those who are unable to do so have to rely on the supply from local markets, such as Dalbandin and Quetta.
Due to the immense distance between them, goods brought from these far-flung markets are often priced out of reach for locals, owing to the added transportation costs.
The irony here is that the goods they are buying from larger urban centres are also Iranian-made products that are brought in via transit trade.
Although local alternatives are available in Quetta’s markets, people prefer to purchase Iranian goods due to their superior quality.
According to Mr Reki, if the Iranian edible items such as fish, cooking oil, or ghee are transported from Quetta to Mashkhel through local transporters, it costs them three times their original price.
“For instance,” he explains, “the price of fish is Rs180 in Jalk. But in Mashkhel, we get the Iranian fish from Quetta, and that too for around Rs400.”
Mohammad Ayub Mariani, president of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also said that trade was returning to pre-war levels.
“But the hurdles to trade with Iran lie on our part,” he said.
“The government ought to give subsidies to the people living in border towns, to provide them with edible items, oil, diesel, groceries that are supplies from Karachi,” he said.
Washuk Deputy Commissioner Abdul Majeed Sarparah told Dawn that Pakistan wanted to open border points for trade, but Iran hadn’t agreed to the proposal.
Mr Sarparah, who assumed charge of the district last month, said he had visited Mashkhel and held an open court to listen to people’s issues.
“Among other things, locals mentioned the issue of the trade, and I have apprised the higher authorities.”
However, he claimed the situation was starting to normalise since the ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) notified the revised RDs on Monday following approval from the federal cabinet. The move reverses an earlier decision under the TPR to reduce RDs to zero on these items from July 1, a plan that was already ratified by the prime minister and the cabinet.
 
 

The U-turn comes amid mounting pressure from local agricultural lobbies and select industries, reflecting the challenge of balancing reform with vested interests. The total import volume of the affected tariff lines constitutes less than 0.02pc of the country’s overall imports, yet these products still attract customs duties (CDs) of 15-20pc and an additional customs duty (ACD) of 2.4pc. The current RDs range between 10pc and 35pc.
Despite the negligible trade volume, the steering committee had recommended the complete elimination of RD to simplify the tariff regime and lower consumer costs — a suggestion initially endorsed at the highest levels of government. However, the government has now reversed course, citing revenue needs and industry protection.

Regulatory duties on seafood, fruits, vegetables and industrial inputs restored under pressure from domestic lobbies

Among the sectors benefiting from restored protection are polyester filament yarn, soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, ceramics, and iron & steel. For instance, polyester filament yarn now carries a CD of 10pc, RD of 2.5pc, and an anti-dumping duty of 5–20pc. Though a zero RD was initially approved, industry pressure led to the re-imposition of the 2.5pc duty.
Additionally, RDs on numerous intermediate goods — such as chemicals, hot-rolled coils (HRC), and IT and telecom hardware — which were earlier set to be reduced, have also been increased. These measures are expected to generate an estimated Rs20bn in additional revenue. However, analysts warn that higher duties on critical inputs may undermine the export competitiveness of textiles, light engineering, and IT services — key sectors targeted under the reform agenda.
Reversal in original TRP
As a result of last-minute amendments, the average RD under the current plan has risen to 3.72pc from 2.96pc in the original proposal. The overall simple average tariff (SAT) now stands at 16.58pc, compared to 15.83pc previously.
The TPR was originally designed to cut the SAT by 50pc over five years, with aggressive reductions of over 20pc annually in the first two years. The sudden changes have not derailed the broader reform roadmap, but the manner in which they were introduced has raised serious concerns.
The original plan was finalised after six meetings of the steering committee and was unanimously approved by the cabinet and the prime minister. In its sixth meeting, the committee agreed that any further changes to CD, ACD, or RD would not only deviate from the National Tariff Policy but also complicate the system. Yet, those same changes were later pushed through without input from the original consultants, who were excluded from the final decision-making process and not allowed to raise objections.
The developments have cast doubt over the government’s resolve to resist pressure from powerful interest groups. With deeper cuts in tariffs on auto, iron & steel, and the polyester chain scheduled for next year, concerns are growing that the government may once again bow to pressure — potentially undermining the long-term objective of boosting exports through a simplified and competitive tariff structure.

• Committee orders cancellation of current bidding process
ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division on Monday uncovered what it called “massive corruption, ghost tendering and illegal contracts” in the Rs170 billion Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III corridor project, after all four contracts were awarded to a single firm previously blacklisted by the National Highway Authority (NHA).
The committee, chaired by Senator Saifullah Abro, reprimanded the NHA for favouring the Chinese firm Ningxia Communication Construction (NXCC), which had been disqualified in 2023 for failing to complete a previous project.
The committee directed the NHA to cancel the current bidding process and initiate a fresh one.
“The Chinese company, terminated by NHA, was disqualified in 2023 after being awarded a contract of Rs6.86 billion for the Lodhran-Multan project in 2021, where only 8 per cent work was completed while around Rs2 billion were already paid,” Mr Abro said.
“Shockingly, this same company has now been illegally awarded a fresh contract worth Rs172bn for CAREC Tranche-III in 2024. How is the company that has been terminated and disqualified by the NHA being given a tender again? This is a case of ghost tendering.”
The meeting was attended by Senators Haji Hidayatullah Khan, Syed Waqar Mehdi, Falak Naz, Kamran Murtaza, and Kamil Ali Agha.
Several construction firms have already contested the contract awards for the four sections of the CAREC Tranche-III project, bringing their grievances before the Grievance Redressal Cell (GRC) of the NHA and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
The complainants had questioned the financial stren­gth of NXCC and its eligibility under NHA criteria.
According to documents reviewed by Dawn, NXCC was disqualified by the NHA in 2023 for failing to complete the 62km Lodhran-Multan section but was still allowed to submit bids for the CAREC project.
The NHA claimed the firm had been cleared by the court, but Senator Abro questioned why the NHA had not appealed the decision. “You wasted the time to facilitate the firm,” he said.
Senator Kamran Murtaza asked why the NHA was fav­ouring a firm disqualified twice and whether NXCC had provided an affidavit stating it was not facing litigation.
NHA officials said no such affidavit was submitted, but Mr Abro presented an affidavit from the firm claiming otherwise. “You [NHA] are befooling the government as the firm had submitted a false statement,” Mr Abro said.
Senator Kamil Ali Agha demanded the firm be blacklisted for life.
“Suspend this project immediately, we will not allow you [NHA] to commit such a heinous irregularity,” Mr Abro said.
Meanwhile, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) ruled that the appeal against the NHA’s decision was maintainable and directed the NHA not to finalise the procurement process until the appeal was resolved.
The CAREC Tranche-III project involves four lots for which 20 firms submitted bids.
After technical evaluation, five firms each qualified for Lots 1 and 2, four for Lot-3, and two for Lot-4. The total PC-I cost is estimated at Rs85.44bn.
The project aims to convert a two-lane highway into a four-lane highway.
“The Federal Minister for Economic Affairs has the responsibility to take action against corruption worth billions of rupees,” Mr Abro said.

In a two-page letter to the JCP secretary, Justice Mulakhail has raised an objection to the invitation extended to the former judge to participate in the JCP meeting.
The application highlighted that in line with constitutional practice, every time a nomination for the chief justice of a high court has been presented to the commission, the nomination of the former judge was made afresh.
For the nomination of Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel as BHC chief justice, Justice (retd) Qazi Faez Isa was nominated as a JCP member. Similarly, for the nomination of Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel was nominated as a one-time member of the JCP.

This was claimed by the think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) in its report for the second quarter of current year. The report claims that fatalities dropped from 900 in Q1 to 615 in Q2, 2025, a metric behind the reported 32pc reduction in violence.
The fatalities suffered by security personnel and civilians combined (282) were still less than the total number of outlaws’ fatalities recorded (333) – amounting to over 15pc less losses among civilians and security officials. Around 32pc and 40pc less violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, respectively, compared to the first quarter.
The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was the main contributor to violence in KP, and Balochistan remained a parallel epicentre of unrest, marked by a deadly mix of separatist militancy and targeted violence, particularly against security forces of the country.

CRSS report notes TTP main contributor to violence in KP; Balochistan witnessed deadly mix of separatist militancy, targeted violence

“The spread of militancy into previously calmer areas is also concerning. Pakistan’s largest province of Punjab, on the other hand, witnessed an alarming trend, recording a surge in fatalities by 162pc, though the number of fatalities was low; from 8 in Q1 to 21 in Q2, 2025. Notably, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which reported zero fatalities in Q1, recorded six deaths in Q2. Islamabad and Sindh remained largely unaffected with minimal fluctuations,” it said.
 
 

While the intensity of violence has eased in traditional hotspots, its spread to new or less-prepared regions will require continued attention and policy adjustments.
Civilians suffered 107 terror attacks, compared to security officials suffering 91 and outlaws targeted in 75 security operations. Moreover, they suffered 249 injuries compared to security officials suffering 120 injuries and outlaws with only 19.
Meanwhile, deaths among outlawed elements — militants and insurgents — fluctuated around 35pc during 2021 to 2024 but surged to around 55pc by Q2, 2025, indicating intensified and successful counter-terrorism campaigns.

International kabaddi player and father of victims Naveed Pehlwan told Dawn.com that the family had ordered food during a birthday party.
“The family, including me, my wife and five children, were taken to the hospital after feeling sick,” he said.
He added that two of the children, an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old, passed away while two others were in critical condition.
“On the directions of Punjab Food Authority Director General Muhammad Asim Javaid, food safety teams conducted a crackdown in Eminabad following the alleged death of two minor girls due to toxic food,” according to a PFA handout seen by Dawn.com.
The operations were carried out from the identification of the suspected food outlets by the family, the statement read.
It said, “During the raid, two food outlets were sealed and various food samples, including cake, cream, red chilli powder, cooking oil, and chicken, were collected and sent to the laboratory for analysis.”
The statement quoted the PFA spokesperson as saying that further action will be taken once laboratory reports are received.
He further said, “[The] initial medical findings revealed the children had been unwell for several days and were already under treatment. Meanwhile case is also under police investigation,” he added.
PFA DG Javaid said that the food outlets that were involved in compromising public health will face strict action according to food safety laws, the statement added.
Last week, a Rawalpindi woman was in critical condition at the hospital after her three children died due to food poisoning.
In April, a food poisoning affected approximately 1,500 people in the Dhoong village of Gujar Khan, while the cause was unknown to the authorities and residents.</p><small>2025-06-30 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611754-us-woman-arrives-in-pakistan-to-marry-kp-man' target='_blank'><strong>US woman arrives in Pakistan to marry KP man</strong></a><br><p>

Traffic snarls were also caused in several areas due to the confrontations.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com, “Eighty-seven [protesters were] arrested and released on commitment to call off the protest,” adding that their future course of action would be announced after 13th Muharam.
He said the police initially took action as negotiations among the representatives of the employees and officials failed. “The Sindh Employees’ Alliance (SEA) — an alliance of different departments of Sindh government employees — were marching towards the Chief Minister’s House.
“The SEA has made three major demands, including an increase of 70 per cent salaries and pension of Sindh employees of Sindh from grade 1 to 22, granting DRA (disparity reduction allowance) of 50pc to all employees of the same grades, and group insurance and benevolent fund after retirement to all employees of the said grades as per pattern of Balochistan government.”

DIG Raza said that the leaders of the alliance held talks with officials, including with him, Planning and Development Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Karachi commissioner and finance secretary at the Commissioner’s office.
“The talks failed as there was no agreement,” he said, adding that the protesters gathered outside the Karachi Press Club in the morning and planned to move towards the CM House.
The roads near the CM House were already barricaded by the law enforcement agencies, he said, adding that police used water cannons to disperse protesters marching towards the Aiwan-i-Saddar Road, near the Governor House.
Witnesses and protesting leaders told Dawn.com that the police used tear gas shells as well.
“They were dispersed and diverted towards the venue of the protest at the Karachi Press Club after the police action,” DIG Raza said, adding that no one was arrested.
Speaking to the media outside the KPC, SEA’s Ashraf Khaskheli, Zamir Chandio, and other leaders said the police resorted to “torture” while dispersing the protesters.
They said that they would plan a future course of action and were planning to move towards Bilawal House in Clifton for their demands.
The leaders claimed that provincial minister Nasir Shah had “accepted” their demands, but Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah sought three days for talks.
Earlier today, Nasir told the media that the Sindh government would try to address the legitimate demands of the employees.
“It has been a priority of the PPP-led government to provide jobs to the youth,” Nasir said, adding that he would present the demands before CM Murad.
He further said that while everyone had the right to protest, such protests should not happen as they cause inconvenience to the general public.
Separately,  South SSP (Traffic) Suhai Aziz told Dawn.com, “Four main roads, namely Aiwan-i-Saddar, Dr Ziauddin Ahmad Road, Din Muhammad Wafai Road and Sarwar Shaheed, have been closed by district police.”
The traffic police chief said that 4pm to 7pm were considered peak hours when “traffic is moving bumper to bumper”.
“Due to the closure of the four major roads, there is a major impact on adjacent roads like I.I. Chundrigar Road, Abdullah Haroon, M.T. Khan and Saddar,” she added.
According to traffic alerts issued by the Karachi police, the roads were closed due to “security reasons”. The alerts said, “Traffic from PIDC Chowk is being diverted towards Club Road, and from State Life Building towards B. Mountain Road,” adding, “Traffic from Sultanabad Chowki is being directed towards Mai Kolachi Road and Boat Basin.
“Traffic from Fountain Chowk is being diverted towards Zainab Market, and from Thana Gali towards M.R. Kiani Chowrangi,” they added.</p><small>2025-06-30 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/302216023025e7e.jpg?r=221621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921249/president-gives-assent-to-finance-act-2025' target='_blank'><strong>President gives assent to Finance Act 2025</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari has given his assent to the Finance Act 2025, which outlines the budget for the upcoming fiscal year with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, it emerged on Monday.
According to a gazette notification dated June 29, available with Dawn.com, the Finance Act 2025, as approved by the National Assembly, received the president’s assent on June 27. The act will be applicable from July 1, according to the information ministry.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged June 10 National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.
The National Assembly passed the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year on June 26, with an outlay of Rs17.57tr, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.
The House passed it with certain amendments, incorporating around half of the suggestions put forward by the finance committees of both houses of parliament. All amendments proposed by the opposition were rejected.
Budget 2025-26
The federal budget for the next fiscal year projects an economic growth rate of 4.2pc and an inflation rate of 7.5pc. The net revenue receipts have been estimated at Rs11.07tr, with FBR collections projected to rise by 18.7pc to Rs14.13tr. Non-tax revenues are estimated at Rs5.15tr.
Key allocations include Rs2.55tr for defence, Rs1.06tr for pension expenditures, and Rs1.19tr for subsidies on electricity and other sectors. Relief measures in the budget include a 10pc increase in salaries, 7pc in pensions and tax relief for the salaried class across all income brackets.
The budget also includes Rs716bn for BISP and Rs1tr for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), in which the largest allocation of Rs328bn is earmarked for transport infrastructure projects.
The PSDP for the next fiscal year has been aligned with the objectives of URAAN Pakistan, prioritising high-impact, near-completion foreign-funded projects and new initiatives of national importance.
Key infrastructure projects like Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand Dam and K-IV have been allocated Rs32.7bn, Rs35.7bn and Rs3.2bn, respectively. Besides, Rs10bn has been allocated for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder and Rs4.4bn for installing a telemetry system on the Indus Basin System.
The Higher Education Commission has been allocated Rs39.5bn for 170 projects. Additionally, Rs18.5bn has been earmarked in the PSDP for various education initiatives.
The agriculture sector will receive Rs4bn for 10 ongoing and five new schemes. The budget also includes incentives for the construction industry, such as a reduction in withholding tax on property purchases.</p><small>2025-06-30 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/3021573811a6e8a.jpg?r=215834' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921250/thousands-flee-wildfires-in-turkiye-as-europe-is-hit-by-early-heatwave' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands flee wildfires in Turkiye as Europe is hit by early heatwave</strong></a><br><p>Firefighters battled wildfires in Turkiye and France on Monday, and more than 50,000 people were evacuated as an early summer heatwave hit Europe.
Health alerts were issued in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Germany. Even the Netherlands, used to a milder climate, issued a warning for high temperatures in the coming days, coupled with high humidity.
“Large parts of Western Europe are experiencing extreme heat and heatwave conditions that are normally observed in July or August, rather than June,” said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
Temperatures were in some locations 5-10 degrees Celsius warmer than they otherwise should have been at this time of the year, she said.
In Turkiye, wildfires raged for a second day in the western province of Izmir, fanned by strong winds, Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said. More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from five regions, including more than 42,000 in Izmir, Turkiye’s AFAD emergency management authority said.
Turkiye’s coastal regions have in recent years been ravaged by wildfires as summers have become hotter and drier, which scientists say is a result of human-induced climate change.
In France, where temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday and Wednesday, wildfires broke out on Sunday in the southwestern Aude department, where temperatures topped 40°C, burning 400 hectares and forcing the evacuation of a campsite and an abbey, authorities said.
The fires were under control but not yet extinguished, authorities said on Monday. Weather service Meteo France put a record 84 of the country’s 101 departments on an orange heatwave alert from Monday until midweek.
Western Europe bakes
From spectators queuing at the All England Club for the Wimbledon tennis tournament to tourists at the Colosseum in Rome and Seville in Spain, people sweltered in the heat.
“It’s about 20 degrees warmer than I’m used to and I’m sunburnt all over,” said tennis fan Scott Henderson, attending Wimbledon from Scotland.
Spain is on course for its hottest June on record, the national meteorological service AEMET said.
“Over the next few days, at least until Thursday, intense heat will continue in much of Spain,” said Ruben del Campo, a spokesperson for the weather agency.
In Seville, southern Spain, where global leaders gathered for a United Nations conference, temperatures hit 42°C.
“It’s awful,” municipal worker Bernabe Rufo said as he cleaned a fountain. “We need to be looking for shade constantly.” The top temperature in the country was registered at 43.7°C in El Granado.
In Italy, the Health Ministry issued heatwave red alerts for 16 cities, including Rome and Milan.
The Lombardy region, part of Italy’s northern industrial heartland, is planning to ban open-air work in the hottest part of the day, heeding a request from trade unions, its president said.
Consumers urged to limit water use
In Germany, too, heat warnings were in place across large parts of western and southwestern regions on Monday, where temperatures climbed to up to 34°C. Authorities appealed to consumers to limit their use of water.
The heatwave has lowered water levels on the Rhine River, hampering shipping and raising freight costs for cargo owners, commodity traders said. German and French baseload power prices for Tuesday surged as the heatwave led to increased demand for cooling.
Heat can affect health in various ways, and experts are most concerned about older people and babies, as well as outdoor labourers and people struggling economically.
Globally, extreme heat kills up to 480,000 people annually, surpassing the combined toll from floods, earthquakes and hurricanes, and poses growing risks to infrastructure, the economy and healthcare systems, Swiss Re said earlier this month.
Scientists say the main cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Last year was the planet’s hottest on record.</p><small>2025-06-30 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611722-pti-urges-govt-to-move-beyond-statements-engage-in-meaningful-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>PTI urges govt to move beyond statements, engage in meaningful dialogue</strong></a><br><p>

According to the PCA’s rules, a supplemental award is an additional ruling issued by a court or tribunal after its initial decision, usually to address a specific issue that wasn’t fully resolved or to clarify certain points, such as jurisdiction, competence, or interpretation of a treaty or agreement.
India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
“In a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,” the FO said in today’s statement.
“The Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India’s illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.”
It added that the award “vindicates Pakistan’s position that the Indus Waters Treaty remains valid and operational, and that India has no right to take unilateral action about it”.
The FO urged India to “immediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.”
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the court’s ruling confirmed that the IWT still remained fully valid.
 






Pakistan earlier welcomed the decision by the PCA to issue a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, reiterating that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
According to the government’s statement, Pakistan welcomed the PCA’s decision and stated that the court affirmed its competence despite India’s unilateral action against the IWT.
“Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the first phase on the merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024,” the statement read.
“The high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty,” the government said, reiterating remarks made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism”.
The Indian Ministry for External Affairs (MEA) had “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself, according to Indian newspaper The Hindu.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” the ministry maintained.
According to The Hindu, the MEA said that after the Pahalgam attack, India exercised “its rights as a sovereign nation under international law” and placed the IWT in abeyance “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”. The ministry additionally described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.
‘Treaty remains in force’
According to a press release from the PCA, the court found that it was not open to India to suspend the IWT or hold it in abeyance unilaterally.
“The Court first considered the terms of the Treaty (IWT), which do not provide for the unilateral ‘abeyance’ or ‘suspension’ of the Treaty; rather, according to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,” the press release read.
“The Court found that the terms of the Treaty, read in light of the Treaty’s object and purpose, do not allow either Party, acting unilaterally, to hold in abeyance or suspend an ongoing dispute settlement process, given that to do so would fundamentally undermine ‘the value and efficacy of the Treaty’s compulsory third-party dispute settlement process’.”
During the court proceedings, the PCA noted that it was not open to India to unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance “regardless of how India’s position was characterised or justified under international law”.</p><small>2025-06-30 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301801045e4e81c.png?r=180312' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921233/spain-socialist-heavyweight-detained-in-corruption-case-legal-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Spain socialist heavyweight detained in corruption case: legal sources</strong></a><br><p>Spanish authorities on Monday detained former top socialist party official Santos Cerdan in a corruption case that is a new blow for left-wing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, judicial sources said.
Former transport minister José Luis Ábalos has also been implicated in the investigation into kickbacks for public contracts, which has created the biggest political crisis Sanchez has faced since taking office in 2018.
The sources said a Supreme Court judge ordered the detention of Cerdan, who has quit as the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party organisation secretary — the ruling party’s number three post — as there was a “risk” he might try to flee or destroy evidence.
He is being held without bail on allegations of corruption, money laundering and criminal association, the sources said.
Cerdan denied the accusation in an audience with the lead investigating judge on Monday, saying he was the victim of a political plot, they said.
Sanchez has sought to distance himself and the Socialist party from the scandal, which involves suspicions of dirty dealings in the purchase of health equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The Socialist party reacted firmly from the start,” the prime minister said.
“Santos Cerdan was dismissed” from the party when the revelations emerged, he added when questioned about the case at an international conference in Seville.
A police report has said there was evidence including audio recordings suggesting Cerdan received payments in exchange for irregularly awarded public contracts.
Ábalos, the prime minister’s former right-hand man, and a top adviser, Koldo Garcia, are also among the suspects targeted in the investigation.
Sanchez has repeatedly apologized over the case and denied knowledge of the alleged scheme.
But the opposition has called for the prime minister to resign.</p><small>2025-06-30 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/30193705be08f68.jpg?r=193741' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921192/dalai-lama-suggests-institution-to-continue-at-90th-birthday-celebrations' target='_blank'><strong>Dalai Lama suggests institution to continue at 90th birthday celebrations</strong></a><br><p>Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, gave on Monday the strongest indication yet that the 600-year-old institution would continue after his death, at prayer celebrations for his 90th birthday.
The Dalai Lama joined thousands of Buddhist followers on Monday in the prayer celebrations, a landmark event resonating far beyond the Indian Himalayan town where he has lived for decades.
“As far as the institution of the Dalai Lama, there will be some kind of a framework within which we can talk about its continuation,” he said, speaking in Tibetan.
The leader, who turns 90 on July 6, is according to Tibetans the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
He and thousands of other Tibetans have lived in exile in India since Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959.
Draped in traditional maroon and yellow robes, the Dalai Lama sat and listened to speeches and chants of monks, nuns, pilgrims, as well as well-wishers from across the world on Monday.
“Though I am 90 years old, physically I am very healthy,” he said, before tasting a slice of Tibetan-style birthday cake, an elaborately decorated tower made from roasted barley and butter cut in front of him.
“In the time I have left, I will continue to dedicate myself to the well-being of others as much as possible,” he said.
‘Continuation’
The Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday is more than a personal milestone.
The charismatic Nobel Peace Prize-winning Buddhist Tenzin Gyatso is also expected to reveal if there will be another Dalai Lama after him.
The Dalai Lama has said the institution will continue only if there is popular demand — and is widely expected to reveal that decision on Wednesday.
The occasion carries profound weight not only for Tibetans, but also for global supporters who see the Dalai Lama as a symbol of non-violence, compassion and the enduring struggle for Tibetan cultural identity under Chinese rule.
“We offer our fervent devotions that Tenzin Gyatso, protector of the Land of Snows, lives for one hundred eons,” a chorus of red-robed monks sang.
“May all your noble aspirations be fulfilled,” they added, in front of a crowd that included religious leaders of many faiths.
His advancing age has also sparked concern over the future of Tibetan leadership and the delicate question of his succession.
The Dalai Lama has been lauded by his followers for his tireless campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau in China about the size of South Africa.
The Dalai Lama handed over political authority in 2011 to an exiled government chosen democratically by 130,000 Tibetans globally.
At the same time, he warned that the future of his spiritual post faced an “obvious risk of vested political interests misusing the reincarnation system”.</p><small>2025-06-30 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611759-sir-anwar-pervezs-birthday-celebrated-by-king-charles-queen-camilla' target='_blank'><strong>Sir Anwar Pervez's birthday celebrated by King Charles, Queen Camilla</strong></a><br><p>

“Customs officers… foiled yet another wildlife smuggling attempt, 16 live snakes… seized from passenger returning from Thailand,” said customs officers in the airport in the Indian financial hub.
The passenger, who arrived on Sunday, has been arrested, the customs agency said in a statement, with “further investigation underway”.
The live snakes included reptiles often sold in the pet trade, and were largely non-venomous, or with venom too weak to affect people.
They included garter snakes, a rhino rat snake and a Kenyan sand boa, among others.
In early June, customs officers stopped a passenger smuggling dozens of venomous vipers, also arriving from Thailand.
Days later, officers stopped another traveller carrying 100 creatures including lizards, sunbirds and tree-climbing possums.
Wildlife trade monitor Traffic, which battles the smuggling of wild animals and plants, has warned of a “very troubling” trend in trafficking driven by the exotic pet trade.
More than 7,000 animals, dead and alive, have been seized along the Thailand-India air route in the last 3.5 years, it said.</p><small>2025-06-30 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/30162834dab6b95.jpg?r=162857' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921228/israel-steps-up-gaza-bombardment-ahead-of-white-house-talks-on-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Israel steps up Gaza bombardment ahead of White House talks on ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Palestinians in northern Gaza reported one of the worst nights of Israeli bombardment in weeks after the military issued mass evacuation orders on Monday, while Israeli officials were due in Washington for a new ceasefire push by the Trump administration.
A day after US President Donald Trump urged an end to the 20-month-old conflict, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran, and possible wider regional diplomatic deals.
But on the ground in the Palestinian enclave, there was no sign of fighting letting up.
“Explosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes,” said Salah, 60, a father of five children, from Gaza City. “In the news, we hear a ceasefire is near, on the ground, we see death, and we hear explosions.”
Israeli tanks pushed into the eastern areas of the Zeitoun suburb in Gaza City and shelled several areas in the north, while aircraft bombed at least four schools after ordering hundreds of families sheltering inside to leave, residents said.
At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, health authorities said, including 10 people killed in Zeitoun.
 
 

The Israeli military said it struck militant targets in northern Gaza, including command and control centres, after taking steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.
The heavy bombardment followed new evacuation orders to vast areas in the north, where Israeli forces had operated before and left behind wide-scale destruction.
The military ordered people there to head south, saying that it planned to fight Hamas fighters operating in northern Gaza, including in the heart of Gaza City.
Later on Monday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said at least 13 people had been killed southwest of Gaza City, bringing Monday’s death toll to at least 38.
Medics said most of the casualties were hit by gunfire, but residents also reported an airstrike. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military on the incident.
Next steps
A day after Trump called to “Make the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back”, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu’s, was expected on Monday at the White House for talks on Iran and Gaza, an Israeli official said.
In Israel, Netanyahu’s security cabinet was expected to convene to discuss the next steps in Gaza.
 
 

On Friday, Israel’s military chief said the present ground operation was close to having achieved its goals, and on Sunday, Netanyahu said new opportunities had opened up for recovering the hostages, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
Palestinian and Egyptian sources with knowledge of the latest ceasefire efforts said that mediators Qatar and Egypt have stepped up their contacts with the two warring sides, but that no date has been set yet for a new round of truce talks.
A Hamas official said that progress depends on Israel changing its position and agreeing to end the conflict and withdraw from Gaza. Israel says it can end the offensive only when Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Israel has agreed to a US-proposed 60-day ceasefire and hostage deal, and put the onus on Hamas.
“Israel is serious in its will to reach a hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.
The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the remains of other Palestinians. Hamas would release the remaining hostages as part of a deal that guarantees the end of the conflict.
The conflict began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 hostages back to Gaza in a surprise attack that led to Israel’s single deadliest day.
Israel’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, has displaced almost the whole 2.3 million population and plunged the enclave into a humanitarian crisis.
More than 80 per cent of the territory is now an Israeli-militarised zone or under displacement orders, according to the United Nations.
Pressure mounts on Netanyahu to end Gaza campaign
Netanyahu’s rise in popularity during the war with Iran may already be fading, as pressure mounts at home to end the conflict in Gaza.
Netanyahu claimed victory over the Islamic Republic in the 12-day war that ended with a ceasefire last week, after Trump ordered US warplanes to join in bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
 
 

Political scientist Assaf Meydani, in a column on Israeli website Ynet on Saturday, said that alongside a “victory for both Trump and Netanyahu” in Iran, the Israeli leader “will have to explain a series of failures”.
Most notable among them, according to Meydani, is Netanyahu’s “failure to end the campaign in Gaza”.
“Hamas, though battered, has not been destroyed, and ‘Swords of Iron’ has become prolonged attrition,” Meydani said, using Israel’s name for its military campaign in the Gaza Strip.
“The people of Israel are strong, but tensions are simmering.”
Israelis fearful of the threat of a nuclear Iran rallied behind Netanyahu as he led the campaign against Israel’s longtime rival. Now that the war is over, domestic and international pressure has resumed to secure an end to the fighting in Gaza.
A public opinion poll published by Israel’s Kan public broadcaster the day after the ceasefire with Iran suggested a rise in support for Netanyahu.
But while his approval ratings went up compared to previous polls, 52pc of respondents in the Kan survey still said they wanted Netanyahu — Israel’s longest-serving prime minister — out of office.
Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they wanted the Gaza campaign to end, compared to 22pc who favoured continuing the fighting.
Israeli newspaper Maariv said on Friday that its polling showed a “surge” for Netanyahu immediately after the ceasefire with Iran had “evaporated almost entirely” within days.
In the coastal hub of Tel Aviv on Saturday, thousands of people gathered to demand a ceasefire deal that would bring home the dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
Liri Albag, who was released from captivity in January under a short-lived truce, told the crowd that Netanyahu and Trump “made brave decisions on Iran. Now make the brave decision to end the war in Gaza and bring [the hostages] home”.
Netanyahu has also faced renewed pressure from one of his political rivals, former prime minister Naftali Bennett.
Criticising the Netanyahu government’s “inability to decide” on Gaza, Bennett called for “a comprehensive agreement that includes the release of all the hostages” to end “the terrible impasse and political confusion”.
“Netanyahu must step down. He has been in power for 20 years … that’s far too long,” Bennett told Israel’s Channel 12 in an interview that aired on Saturday.
“The people want change, they want calm,” added Bennett, who is widely expected to run for office again in the next elections, scheduled for late 2026.
Gil Dickman, a prominent activist demanding action by Israel to secure the release of the hostages, said that while “the operation in Iran was a success”, Netanyahu had “failed” to “make people forget his responsibility” for failing to prevent Hamas’s unprecedented 2023 attack.
Dickman, whose cousin Carmel Gat was killed in captivity and her body retrieved from Gaza in August, told AFP that Netanyahu’s “terrible failures and the abandonment of the hostages will not be forgotten”.
Expressing “cautious optimism” after Trump’s recent remarks, Dickman said there was “apparently an opportunity to end the war”.
“We couldn’t save my cousin, but we can still save those who are still alive in Gaza. “</p><small>2025-06-30 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611703-pakistan-urges-india-to-resume-full-implementation-of-water-treaty-after-hague-courts-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>After Hague ruling, Pakistan presses India to fully implement water treaty</strong></a><br><p>

Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the British broadcaster that the US had signalled it wants to return to the negotiating table, a week after it struck three Iranian nuclear facilities.
“We have not agreed to any date, we have not agreed to the modality,” said Takht-Ravanchi.
“Right now we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?”
 
 

The US needed to be “quite clear on this very important question”, he said.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it “since we totally obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.
“I am not offering Iran anything, unlike Obama,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
The two countries were in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme when Israel hit Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 21.
At least 935 people were killed in Iran during its 12-day war with Israel, Iranian state media reported today, nearly a week since a ceasefire took hold. “During the 12-day war waged by the Zionist regime against our country, 935 martyrs have been identified so far,” the official IRNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying, adding that the death toll included 132 women and 38 children.
The deputy minister revealed to the BBC that the US had signalled it did “not want to engage in regime change” by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Takht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium.
“The level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,” he said.
Israel claims that Iran’s nuclear programme is close to producing a bomb, whereas Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.
It is not clear yet how much damage the strikes inflicted on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which Trump had said were “totally obliterated”.
UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran would probably be able to begin to produce enriched uranium “in a matter of months”.
Takht-Ravanchi said he did not know how long it would take.
Under a 2015 deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium below 3.67 per cent purity for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.
Trump abandoned the agreement in 2018 and Iran responded by producing uranium enriched to 60 pc — above levels for civilian usage but still below weapons grade.
That material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.</p><small>2025-06-30 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611698-sindh-seeks-suspension-of-cellular-services-on-10th-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh seeks suspension of cellular services on 10th Muharram</strong></a><br><p>

Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water. Authorities have warned of potential flash floods and landslides as monsoon rains continue across the province.
The PDMA released a report on the loss of life and property due to rain-related incidents in different districts of the province including Swat, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Buner, Swabi, Kurram Charsadda, Malakand, Shangla, Lower Dir, Torghar, and South Waziristan.
According to the report, the victims include seven men, five women and 10 children, while the injured include six men, four women and one child. A total of 75 houses were damaged due to rain, of which 64 were partially and 11 completely destroyed.
Swat was the most affected district, in which 14 people were killed and six people were injured, the report added.
The PDMA instructed the district administration to provide immediate assistance to the affected families and ensure the provision of medical facilities to the injured.
The disaster management agency said rains are likely to continue till July 1. The PDMA has already issued a letter to the district administration to remain alert and take preventive measures.
Rescue operation continues in Swat River
Meanwhile, rescue officials continued a search operation on the fourth straight day in the Swat River on Monday after a group of 13 tourists went missing amid heavy rainfall and a flash flood.
Efforts are being made to recover the body of a child who is still missing since Friday, while 12 bodies were found earlier.
Rescue teams are conducting search operations in various location along the river including Swat bypass, Kanju and Brikot to locate the missing child.
Adviser to the chief minister on information in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif assured that action will be taken against those responsible for the drowning of the tourists.
Speaking to the media, the adviser said 80 people have been rescued in the flash floods. He added that the provincial government will take ‘indiscriminate’ action against encroachments along the Swat River.
Saif claimed that sending a helicopter to rescue the tourists swept away by flash floods was not possible as the air ambulance lacked equipment.
“We have an air ambulance. But according to civil aviation, pilots, and other experts, it was not possible to rescue [the tourists] from the location,” he added.
He said the air ambulance is used to transport the injured but does not have the equipment required to airlift people in rescue operations.
He further said sending the air ambulance in the inclement weather conditions and tough terrain would have caused a disaster rather than rescue the stranded people.
Saif said those demanding KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation are also responsible for the deaths in Tharparkar, Sindh.
Earlier, CM Gandapur directed his inspection team to probe into the deaths in Swat River’s flash flood. He also expressed sorrow over the tragedy and announced compensation for the deceased.
The government suspended three officials from Swat’s district administration and one from the relief rehabilitation and settlement department.
People from all walks of life took to the streets on Saturday to protest the deaths, claiming that local residents reached out to Rescue 1122, local administration and other departments but received a late response, leading to the loss of lives.
The Swat Olasi Pasoon and civil society members demonstrated at Nishat Chowk in Mingora against the delayed response of authorities to the call of stranded tourists for help.
Political activists, traders and lawyers also joined them, blaming the Swat River deaths on the negligence of the district administration and rescue officials. The protesters called for the introduction of a modern rescue system, with helicopter service, and an early flood warning system.
They also voiced concerns about the growing riverbed mining in Swat, saying that the unchecked activity has altered the natural course of the Swat River, causing environmental damage and creating dangerous conditions for residents and visitors alike.
They demanded accountability over the flood-related deaths and improvement in disaster management and safety protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.</p><small>2025-06-30 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301234535801e1f.jpg?r=123506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s June inflation likely to remain between 3-4pc: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry, in its monthly economic outlook report on Monday, said that the consumer price index (CPI) inflation was expected to remain in the range of 3 to 4 per cent in June.
Last month, depicting a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had presented a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.
The year-on-year consumer inflation rate in May was the highest since Dece­m­ber, indicating a rebound in inflation after months of slowdown. According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the CPI inflation had stood at 3.46pc in May 2025 as compared to the previous year.
“Inflation is expected to remain within the range of 3.0-4.0pc for June 2025,” said the finance ministry in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook (June 2025) report.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the finance ministry’s inflation projections were in line with their expectations.
“We projected the inflation to remain at 3.2pc in June, the analyst said.
The report said that the outlook for LSM in the coming months appeared to be positive, supported by encouraging trends in high-frequency indicators such as cement dispatches and automobile sales.
Sales of cars, sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans clocked in at 14,762 units in May, reflecting a rise of 35pc year-on-year and 39pc month-on-month.
However, the finance ministry also stated that LSM showed a mixed performance in April 2025, registering a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 2.3pc while contracting by 3.2pc on month-on-month (MoM) basis.
“The uptake in loans to the private sector businesses suggests rising production activities and improved investor confidence,” the report continued.
With regards to the current account surplus, the report stated that the external account position continued to improve during the July-May period of the fiscal year 2024-25 on account of rising remittances and exports.
It stated that on the external front, higher remittances and exports will continue to keep the current account in surplus for FY 2025.
 
 

In the agriculture sector, the report said that quality seeds and mechanisation are expected to boost agricultural output.
“Imports of agricultural machinery rose by 10pc, worth $69.2 million in July–Apr FY2025, indicating rising mechanisation,” the report said.
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, exuding confidence that the country’s economy would be able to post growth of 2.7pc in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).
The National Accounts Committee showed Pakistan’s GDP growth at 1.37pc for the first quarter of FY25, 1.53pc for the second, and 2.4 for the third. This implies that the economy would need to post a growth rate of 5.5pc in the three months of April-June to get to the 2.7pc figure announced by the finance minister.
The GDP growth figure, however, is still lower than 3.6pc, marking the third successive year of the government missing its targeted figure.
