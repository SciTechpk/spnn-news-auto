In the first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com and registered at the Kot Najibullah Police Station, the seven-year-old victim’s father stated he was at work in Taxila when his wife called him after 3pm, informing him that his son “had been struck in the head by some people in the street.”
“When I reached home, I found my son in a bed with his body bearing marks of brutal torture, and he was dead,” the victim’s father stated in the FIR.
He added in the report that when he grilled his wife, she said the boy was making a noise inside the house, so she beat him with a stick.
The complainant further stated that he requested the police to take legal action against his wife as she was the victim’s stepmother, alleging that she had brutally tortured his child to death.
 
 

According to the FIR, the complainant noted that his son had been suffering from some illness owing to his stepmother physically torturing him.
According to Haripur District Police Officer Farhan Khan, the suspect was arrested within an hour of the FIR being registered. He added that an investigation was ongoing and pledged to ensure justice for the victim.
A civil society report published in May, based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country, reported up to 3,364 child abuse cases from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024.
On Saturday, KP police arrested a suspect after a 13-year-old maid was allegedly raped and murdered in Abbottabad.
Last month, a teenage mother was allegedly killed by her husband and father in Gulshan-i-Maymar in the name of ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-08 08:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08124311a07c750.png?r=124337' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922789/not-possible-for-govt-to-provide-housing-for-all-residents-of-dilapidated-buildings-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>Not possible for govt to provide housing for all residents of dilapidated buildings: Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly building collapse in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left 27 people dead, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
Speaking to GeoNews, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.
“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.
“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.
“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.
“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”
Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.
According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-08 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0808572136131da.jpg?r=122836' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922774/netanyahu-nominates-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-as-gazans-await-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Netanyahu nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize as Gazans await ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.
The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.
“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a dinner with Trump at the White House.

Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.
The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.
In 2024, he insisted that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.
In June, Pakistan had also decided to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after US mediation.
However, as the US joined Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also submitted in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.
 
 

Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.
He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p><small>2025-07-08 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081139202f42649.png?r=120945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922786/4-dead-two-injured-in-peshawar-house-fire-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>4 dead, two injured in Peshawar house fire: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>Four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazar on Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.
Spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement, “Six people were rescued from the fire in critical condition and taken to the hospital.
“However, four of them succumbed to their injuries. They have been identified as Rafiq, Shehnaz, Riaz and his wife.”
Faizi added that the firefighters and ambulances reached the site of the incident soon after receiving information and started rescue operations.
“The firefighters initially rescued three people trapped in a house adjacent to a market and transported them to the hospital for medical assistance,” Faizi detailed in the statement.
During the rescue efforts, two firefighters fainted due to the blazing flames. They were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital for treatment, where their condition became stable, he said.
Six fire vehicles and 40 personnel participated in the firefighting efforts, the rescue official continued.
“Firefighters faced extreme difficulty as the house was located in a congested area with narrow alleyways. After hectic efforts, the rescue official confirmed that the flames had been brought under control and the cooling process was underway.”
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires and periodic industrial infernos.
In October 2024, a fire at a tissue paper factory in the Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
The rescue team said the fire erupted as a huge quantity of polythene was stashed inside the factory, which melted due to the fire, and the blaze was difficult to douse.
In June 2024, a fire broke out]2 in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.
The officials said the fire erupted at one of the makeshift structures before engulfing the adjacent shops, which mostly dealt in secondhand clothes, shoes and curtains, and a power transformer.
Rescue 1122 workers and firefighters from Peshawar, Nowshera, Khyber and Charsadda districts controlled the fire in six hours with around 80,000 litres of water and foam.
Around 110 personnel took part in the operation. Rescue officials said the wooden cabins caught fire due to strong winds and fire engulfed three markets before being brought under control.</p><small>2025-07-08 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08122046935e61e.png?r=122148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922785/pakistan-extends-condolences-to-turkiye-after-12-soldiers-die-of-methane-exposure-in-iraq' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends condolences to Turkiye after 12 soldiers die of methane exposure in Iraq</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Tuesday extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier, a statement from the Foreign Office said.
The deaths occurred when the Turkish troops were searching for the remains of a soldier who was shot dead by Kurdish fighters in the area in May 2022 and whose body was never recovered, the Turkish defence ministry said. The incident will be examined in detail with the administrative investigation initiated, it added.
“We wish Allah’s mercy upon the martyrs and express deepest condolences to the bereaved families,” the Foreign Office said in a post on X.
 






“Pakistan stands in firm solidarity with brotherly Turkiye in this moment of grief,” the post added.
Paki­stan and Turkiye share strong bilateral relations rooted in a foundation of shared cultural, religious, and historical connections, and mutual respect.
Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the “heinous” terror attack that killed 13 soldiers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
“I pray to Allah for mercy on our Pakistani brothers and sisters who lost their lives in the attack, and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded,” the president had said.
“As always, Turkiye will continue to stand by our longstanding friend Pakistan in its fight against terrorism.”
In Feb 2023, as Turkiye witnessed two powerful earthquakes that killed more than 55,000 residents and wounded over 100,000, Pakistan dispatched relief goods along with rescue workers and doctors to the country.</p><small>2025-07-08 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/070114189cc33af.jpg?r=011458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921194/washed-away-how-unregulated-mining-turned-the-swat-river-into-a-killer' target='_blank'><strong>Washed away: How unregulated mining turned the Swat River into a killer</strong></a><br><p>There was once a time when the sound of the Swat River — gushing waters in some places, flapping waves in others — echoed across the mountainous valley. For visitors and locals alike, it was a melody that soothed the darkest of nights and harshest of days. That was years ago. Today, the river stands still and quiet under the weight of those who died in it.
On June 27, a family of 13 tourists from Sialkot drowned in the flooded Swat River. With feet soaked in the cool water, they were having breakfast on the riverbank near Mingora. Unbeknownst to them, the water level was swiftly rising, and within minutes, they found themselves stranded on a mound of sand in the middle of the river.
They stood there, waiting for help to arrive. But by the time it came, the family was swept away by the floodwaters, one by one. The deceased included seven-year-old Ayan; Rubina, 45; Ajwa, 18; Sharmeen, 16; Murab, 18; and Tazmeen, 20; from Sialkot. “They all left the house excited for a vacation, but came back home in white shrouds,” a relative mourned.
 

The screengrab from a viral video shows the ill-fated family from Sialkot, who became stranded as the river swelled around them.

Even Swat mourns. “We are ashamed,” said Fazal Wadood, a resident and member of the village defence committee.
The deaths, a video of which went viral on social media, spurred a conversation on social media — about the inefficiency of the local government, the delay in arrival of rescue services and more. But one important factor attributed to the rise in such incidents, as highlighted by locals time and again, remains missing from the discourse: unchecked gravel and sand mining on the bed of the Swat River.
“It has turned our beautiful river into khandarat (ruins),” rued Wadood. “The water used to be our everything … pride, home, livelihood … but it has been reduced to a disaster now.”
The billion-rupee industry
The Swat River is known to be perfect for mining, given its topography. The river flows in the middle of the mountains, making it abundant in gravel and sand, which is a key component of the construction industry. It is a common practice, not just in Pakistan but across the world.
According to activist and academic Dr Rafiullah, the mining process involves digging ditches in the river, approximately 15-20ft deep and 10-15ft wide, and letting the water fill them. When sand and gravel flow down with the water, it accumulates in these ditches, which are then extracted by changing the direction of the river and are subsequently transported to crush plants.
The mining is usually done during the winter months when the flow of the river is slow, while the extraction takes place during summer.
Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has seen a boom, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju. Sand is expensive in Swat with a market value of Rs7,000 per daina — a vehicle used to transport the same — while gravel is sold for Rs3,000, making mining a lucrative business.
“The problem is that such ditches have been dug up everywhere, which has turned the river into a well,” Dr Rafiullah told Dawn.com. “Earlier, there was a set route of the river, and so locals were aware where it was deep and where it wasn’t. But when it was dug up, people could no longer tell this because while on the surface, the water remains still, no one knows what is happening underneath.”
Over the past several years, he continued, the people of Swat have lifted their children in coffins. “They were young boys who went to the river for swimming and bathing.” One of them was Wadood’s 17-year-old nephew, whose body was found in a ditch in the town of Aligrama eight days after he had drowned.
Dr Rafiullah said that the incident of June 27 was also to be blamed on this unrestrained mining. “The miner had constructed a protective dyke to divert the water flow just 300-400 meters from where the family was seated, but it broke down due to flashfloods and heavy rain, increasing the water levels.”
“Within minutes, the family found itself stranded in the middle of the river … the mound of sand they stood on was artificial, a result of mining. By the time anyone understood what happened, it was too late,” he regretted.
Even the investigation report prepared following the incident, seen by Dawn.com, highlighted that water from the Swat River was diverted due to construction work, which allowed the tourists to venture into the river, believing that the water level was low. Subsequently, the chief secretary of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa issued orders to ban all kinds of mining.
The rights and wrongs of mining
In Swat, mining falls under the Directorate General of Mines and Minerals KP. The department has divided the river into multiple sectors, and under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa River Protection Act 2017 and Mining of Minor Minerals from River Bed Rules 2022, it issues a yearly lease to local contractors.
“A district-level committee identifies blocks for mining through site visits and then forwards them to a district auction committee, which then reserves or fixes the prices to each block and issues advertisements,” explained Ashfaq Ahmed Saleem, the additional director general of the minerals department.
Subsequently, an open auction is held, and the highest bidder is allotted the lease, which includes all the rules and regulations for mining. “Currently, 24 plants are functioning on the Swat River, of which six have been auctioned against a total bid of Rs47 million,” Saleem told Dawn.com.
“Apart from these six blocks, any activity on other blocks is illegal,” he said, adding that monthly checks were conducted to ensure compliance with the mining rules.

But locals say violations are common and lament the administration’s inaction to stop them. For one, the mining rules say that “the lease shall neither divert the natural course of the river, nullah, stream […] nor obstruct the natural flow or water”, but reshaping the river’s route is a common practice in Swat.
It further says that the mining should be restricted to a maximum depth of three metres, and the distance from the riverbanks should be one-fourth of the river, and should be no less than 7.5 metres. “What happened here, though, was that they dug up the entire river from one side to the other with trenches as deep as 20-30ft,” Swat-based journalist Sohail Asghar Khan pointed out.
And this, he added, was the major reason behind rising river-related deaths in the region. “If you go towards the Khwazakhela side, you will see 15-20 excavation machines along the riverbed … and this is the case across the valley now.”
When asked about these practices, Saleem said contractors violating the laws were issued notices and, in the absence of rectification, the lease was cancelled.
“As far as mining on unauthorised blocks is concerned, when we catch it, we file a complaint with the police and then a case is sent to the judicial magistrate,” he added.
According to data shared by Saleem, over 830 first information reports have been registered against illegal mining activity since 2018. In 2024-25 alone, 92 FIRs were lodged, of which 21 cases are under trial, while fines were imposed on others. Per mining rules, the punishment for illegal mining amounts to Rs0.5 to Rs2 million and up to three years in jail.
Who is to blame?
For his part, Rehmat Ali, the chairman of the Malakand Crush Association, told Dawn.com that the right way of mining involved using river channels instead of blocking the river or rerouting it as mentioned in the rules and regulations.
“The lessee shall neither divert the natural course of the river, nullah, stream nor obstruct the natural flow of water,” it states.
But, Ali lamented, some people were mining via illegal means. “They are not just harming the river but also us, who are doing this the right way,” he rued. According to him, there were about 67,000 families in Swat that were dependent on mining for their livelihoods.
“We have been doing this legally since 2003. We have licenses from the Environmental Protection Agency and all the other relevant departments,” Ali told Dawn.com. “But those who are doing this illegally are putting the economy of Swat at risk.”
He explained that Swat heavily relied on tourism, which meant the construction industry played a key role in the region, and crush was primarily used for the same, along with roads and bridges. “But when we complain to the government, they fail to take any notice.”

Following the drowning incident, the government last week cancelled all the lease agreements for mining in the Swat River and imposed Section 144. However, despite the ban, locals said mining was carried out at places where the administration was nowhere to be seen.
“In fact, just the day after the tourist family was washed away in the floods, these miners were back on the river banks with their excavators,” Wadood said.
Environmental catastrophe
This unregulated mining is not just claiming human lives but also causing irreversible degradation to the ecosystem of the Swat River and its pristine clear waters. “These waters used to be a lullaby for us, but today, all we can hear is the roar of the excavators and the scraping and crunching of the earth they dig,” said Wadood.
The intensified extraction has rapidly and visibly changed the natural course of the river, triggering a host of environmental challenges such as the degradation of agricultural land, erosion, and the destruction of Swat’s flora and fauna.
“Agricultural land downstream, mostly fields of onion and tomato crops are drying up,” said Sadique Akbar, former professor at the University of Engineering and Technology, Swabi. He told Dawn.com that local farmers, who rely on the Swat River for irrigation, complain that their lands have become less fertile and more prone to flooding and erosion.
The river’s water, once a home to nearly 17 fish species native to Swat, now fails to provide them with the sustenance required and has thus caused them to go extinct. This is not just affecting the livelihood of fishermen, but also diminishing Swat’s appeal to tourists flocking to the region.
“These fish used to find their food hidden in the riverbed, but extensive mining means it is no longer there,” said Dr Rafiullah. “Trout, which was once the saugat (gift) of Swat, is no longer found in freshwater anymore. Whatever is there is farm-produced. Desi trout can now only be found upstream in Kalam or Bahrain, where the water is clean.”
This has taken the livelihoods of fishermen in the region, who are now forced to search for other alternatives. Initially, they could catch up to 6kg-7kg of fish, but now, even if they spend an entire day, they can hardly manage a catch, added Sohail Asghar.
Moreover, the lush green trees that once surrounded the river have now completely vanished. Residents say miners cut them down to create roads that could take their excavators and other big machines to the riverbanks. In addition, miners usually collect sand along the banks of the river, which has taken away its beauty. This, despite the mining rules, which state: “after mining of minor minerals, the debris and hindrance shall be removed from the limits of the river or stream.”
Similarly, seasonal birds that would have stopped by the river earlier for food have now stopped coming there.
Sufyan, a resident of Karachi who recently visited the northern areas, described it in these words: “The Swat I saw in pictures is no longer there; instead, a cloud of dust, the buzzing of machines and trucks are everywhere. It is just sad,” he said.
And then, there is this constant fear among the residents of losing their children. Swat does not have many options when it comes to recreational activities for locals; they were dependent on the river for that too — swimming, sitting on the banks, and fishing. But none of that is possible anymore. The river they once called theirs has become a stranger today; nothing about it is the same anymore. Only memories remain.
And so, the question echoes louder than the lost melody of the Swat River: will anything change before more lives and memories are washed away?

Over the first 10 months of FY25, Pakistan’s exports to the United States totalled $4.46 billion, while imports from the US were valued at $2.05bn.
According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariff profile, Pakistan levies a trade-weighted average tariff of 7.2 per cent on all inbound goods, whereas the US applies a comparatively higher average tariff of 10.7pc on its imports from Pakistan.
Applying these tariffs, the US collected $321 million in tariff revenue on Pakistan exports, while Pakistan earned $219m in tariffs on American imports. Although Pakistan enjoys a positive trade balance, the US garners a greater fiscal gain, collecting approximately 32pc more in tariffs over the 10-month span.
 
 

The impending hike in US tariffs to 29pc as part of the reciprocal trade policy is set to escalate the overall tariff burden — especially for the textile industry, which constitutes 77pc of Pakistan’s export volume to the US — but it could also offer competitive market openings for Pakistan in certain segments as higher tariff walls encumber rival exporting nations, most notably China (50.1pc), Vietnam (46pc), and Bangladesh (37pc).
While India remains a formidable rival, particularly in the textile sector, buoyed by a slightly lower reciprocal tariff rate (26pc), this competitive edge can be effectively neutralised through well-orchestrated strategic policy interventions.

The impending US duty hike is set to escalate the overall burden, but it could also offer competitive market openings

Though the rationale for imposing additional tariffs is anchored in the trade deficit narrative, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) outlined a spectrum of concerns pertaining to its commercial dealings with Pakistan; key grievances include the continued practice of issuing discretionary and non-transparent statutory regulatory orders (SROs), cumbersome & inconsistent import and customs valuation methods, and opaque procurement processes, all of which the United States contends have collectively hurt its exports.
 
 

This rise in the US tariffs, in the immediate term, is likely to suppress demand for Pakistan’s textile exports in the American markets, threatening to ripple through the entire production cycle, leading to production slowdowns, wide-scale layoffs to the tune of half a million jobs, especially in urban areas, and putting pressure on Pakistan’s already fragile foreign exchange coffers.
These adverse impacts could be further exacerbated by mounting competitive pressure from India, which — due to relatively lower US tariffs and vast economic scale — is better positioned to accommodate reduced pricing margins and secure more favourable trade terms from Washington.
Pakistan ought to strategically leverage this opportunity to correct its long-overdue structural trade imbalances with other countries, particularly with China & Gulf countries, by pursuing an import rationalisation strategy grounded in a Pakistan-first trade stance. This realignment would create the policy space necessary for extending concessions to the US in pursuing a more diplomatically and economically palatable trade accord.
In the period from July to March FY25, China ranked as Pakistan’s top import partner, accounting for a whopping 28.83pc of total imports, while contributing just 7.78pc to Pakistan’s exports. Similar asymmetric bilateral trade is observed with the United Arab Emirates (exports: 5.40pc, imports: 10.6pc), Saudi Arabia (exports: 2.33pc, imports: 7.16pc), Indonesia (exports: 1.03pc, imports: 6.68pc), and Qatar (exports: under 1pc, imports: 6.22pc).
These trade imbalances with Gulf States are primarily fuelled by crude oil and petroleum product imports, whereas those with China are mainly driven by chemicals, machinery, and electronic equipment.
 
 

As such, a primary strategic response would be to diversify supply sources by channelling part of these imports, such as cotton and soybeans, through the United States.
To respond to the USTR’s major policy and procedural concerns, Pakistan should strengthen its regulatory credibility by ensuring that the application of SROs is transparent and supported by clear national economic necessity, institutionalising WTO-conforming customs valuation methods, and enforcing standardised review mechanisms.
Over the long haul, policymakers should pursue a strategic blend of export diversification and improving industrial productivity and competitiveness. This involves broadening the export base across product and market frontiers at both domestic and international levels.
In tandem, increasing the competitiveness of the domestic industrial landscape by making targeted investments in cutting-edge manufacturing technologies, building human resource capacities, and modernising logistics systems will be critical to positioning Pakistan as a more agile, resilient, and competitive economy in the rapidly evolving world economic order.

The prime minister has already announced his plan to convene the reconstituted NFC next month, ostensibly to address the issue of an acute vertical imbalance due to enhanced provincial share amid rising federal expenditures on debt servicing, climate resilience and infrastructure, and defence.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), too, has repeatedly, and rightly, insisted on increasing the provinces’ fiscal responsibilities in the wake of their enhanced share from the NFC arrangement for reducing the burden on the federal budget. The production of provincial cash surplus to help the centre control the consolidated fiscal deficit has been part of every recent IMF programme.
 
 

Moreover, the NFC is constitutionally required to be reconstituted once every five years. But 15 years have passed with no new NFC Award, as various attempts to convene the new commissions have failed.
The last NFC award had increased the provinces’ share in the divisible pool from 47.5 per cent to 56pc in 2010–11 and to 57.5pc from 2011 onwards. The award also shifted from a population-only formula for horizontal distribution of the provincial share to a multiple-indicator model, allocating 10.3pc weight to poverty, 5pc to revenue generation, and 2.7pc to inverse population density.

The resource distribution arrangement should focus on resolving outstanding issues and not reversing the process

The population still dominated the new formula with an 82pc weight. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was awarded an additional 1pc share to make up for the cost of security operations, while Balochistan received a guaranteed transfer of its share. At the same time, the 18th Amendment provided constitutional protection to the provincial share, stipulating that a province’s share in any future award must not be less than its share in the previous award. This provision ensures a minimum guaranteed flow of resources to provinces.
 
 

Apart from the shrinking federal fiscal space, the 7th NFC award has also come under scrutiny because of its weak incentive structure for provinces. Despite receiving guaranteed transfers, they have failed to develop robust tax bases, particularly in high-potential sectors like services, agriculture and real estate. The dominance of population in the horizontal formula is also considered problematic and an incentive for the federating units to not control population growth, as pointed out by the finance minister in his post-budget press conference.
The formula also ignores geographic, infrastructural, and security-related expenditures of the provinces. Sparsely populated Balochistan, for example, faces high service delivery costs but receives low transfers. Thus, the dominance of population is also considered a major reason for the unequal economic development of less populous provinces.
Indeed the federal budget has major macroeconomic implications, but the provinces hold the key to socioeconomic development for sustainable growth and fiscal consolidation as the 7th NFC Award and the 18th Constitutional Amendment shift the responsibility of delivering essential public services to the provincial governments. The federating units are doing much better now on this front than in the past.

The last NFC award had increased the provinces’ share in the divisible pool from 47.5 per cent to 56pc in 2010–11 and to 57.5pc from 2011 onwards

In spite of the federal condition of showing significant cash surplus each year under the IMF programme, they have massively raised their annual development allocations, as is reflected by Punjab’s Rs1.24 trillion development spending plan — nearly 25pc bigger than the federal public sector development plan of Rs1tr — for the present fiscal year. Even Balochistan has enhanced its development allocations to Rs290 billion despite resource constraints. Besides, they have been showing the required provincial cash surplus in compliance with the IMF stipulations to reduce the consolidated fiscal deficit.
 
 

Nonetheless, they have miserably failed to enhance the provincial tax revenues, which remain 0.7–0.8pc of the country’s GDP. The low provincial tax revenues reflect their administrative weaknesses and reluctance to tax the politically powerful lobbies.
Economists maintain that the provincial tax revenue can be raised to at least 2pc of the size of the country’s economy in the short- to medium-term by effectively taxing immovable urban property, agriculture income, services and real estate.
The provinces have also lagged in devolving fiscal powers and responsibilities to the third tier of government in line with the spirit of the present NFC arrangement and the 18th Amendment.
A new NFC award is needed as soon as possible in view of the massive changes in the economy and the unmet targets of the previous award. The resource distribution formula should be changed to include indicators like poverty reduction, provincial revenue effort, climate impact, and fiscal decentralisation to the district level.
Furthermore, the focus of the new resource distribution arrangement under the next NFC should be on the resolution of the outstanding issues while deepening fiscal devolution and not on reversing the process started with the existing NFC award and the 18th amendment. Any attempt at curtailing provincial share from the federal taxes to make up for the centre’s own failure to boost its revenues and curtail wasteful expenditure would prove to be counterproductive.

But let’s be honest, particularly in cities across the Global South, that’s only half the story. The real buzz, the real hustle, often hums along in the narrow lanes, the roadside stalls, the open-air repair shops, and the ever-moving handcarts. That’s where rickshaw drivers, mobile phone fixers, street tailors, fruit vendors, and countless others keep the city alive. And yet, these people (despite holding up entire urban economies) are rarely seen in policy documents or GDP calculations.
It is not some fringe issue, either. As of 2023, per the International Labour Organisation’s World Employment and Social Outlook report launched in 2024, over two billion people around the world were working informally. That is nearly 58 per cent of the global labour force. Even though the percentage dipped slightly from 2015, the actual number of informal workers has never been higher. In developing economies, this sector contributes anywhere from 15pc to 35pc of GDP, according to the World Economic Forum; that is massive.
 
 

Consider Pakistan: around three-quarters of the national workforce operate outside formal structures. In urban centres, about 69pc of workers are in the informal sector. And while this sector accounts for roughly a third of the national GDP and dominates non-agricultural employment, its productivity levels are stuck. On average, formal workers produce two to three times more than informal ones. Why? Because informal workers are often cut off from basic systems of credit, training, infrastructure and legal protection. The playing field is not just uneven; it’s tilted steeply.
That’s why when a government steps in with a policy to support informal workers, it gets attention. One recent example is the Punjab Chief Minister’s initiative to distribute “model handcarts” to street vendors in Lahore. The goal, at least on paper, seems noble, ie giving vendors a cleaner, more standardised setup, formalising their presence, reducing urban chaos, and connecting them to systems that could help them grow. So far, 1,000 carts have been rolled out in Lahore, with plans to scale across 40 districts.
And it seems a kind of formalising street vending through structured interventions could actually change their lives. Imagine a vendor who finally gets legal recognition, who’s no longer being pushed around by municipal staff or harassed by extortionists, and who can now apply for a loan or access a support programme. That’s a big deal.

About 69pc of urban workers operate informally, cut off from basic infrastructure and legal protection

But (there’s always a ‘but’) things start to fall apart when the execution doesn’t match the intent. Unfortunately, some news reports have emerged of shady procurement practices, bribes being demanded, inflated costs, and even the suspicious elimination of the lowest bidder. That kind of stuff poisons the entire effort. It turns what could’ve been a smart, inclusive policy into a textbook case of “too good to be true”.
 
 

And here’s the problem: when well-meaning programmes like this go sideways, they don’t just fail quietly. They actively damage trust — among vendors, the public, and even future reformers. People start thinking, “Why bother?” Worse, they likely become cynical about any new initiative, no matter how genuine it might be. That’s a tough cycle to break.
Of course, Pakistan is not alone in this. Around the world, some cities are getting it right — or at least trying harder. Micro-enterprise zones are popping up, offering proper spaces for vendors with access to sanitation, lighting, and storage. Governments try to roll out digital platforms so informal workers can register, get loans, and tap into markets.
Public-private partnerships help with skill training and certification. Even financial inclusion is getting a boost through microloans and flexible credit designed for low-income entrepreneurs. These aren’t just policy wins — they’re real changes that lift people up.
But the catch is we must track what’s working. Are more vendors getting legal status? Is there more municipal revenue from these newly formalised businesses? How many are getting access to microcredit? If we’re not measuring outcomes, we’re just making noise.
Going back to Punjab’s handcart initiative, the real takeaway is that good ideas need clean execution. Vision alone doesn’t cut it. We need transparency in procurement, genuine participation from vendors, and public accountability embedded into the implementation process. Without that, even the best ideas end up feeling hollow, or worse, performative.
 
 

Maybe that is the broader lesson here. Informal workers are not just an issue to be “dealt with” in urban planning. In many ways, they are the urban economy. They are the ones who keep cities functional when everything else falters — during floods, blackouts, and economic downturns.
They’re an affordable option when formal services become unaffordable. Ignoring them or sidelining them is a massive strategic blunder. Instead, governments and planners need to shift perspective.
What if we treated informal workers not as outliers but as partners in development? What if policies were designed with them and not just for them? At the end of the day, real change comes when ambition meets accountability.

Musk’s weekend launch of the “America Party” came in the wake of Trump signing into law a sprawling domestic policy bill that the tech mogul has slammed overestimates that it will balloon the deficit.
Musk has been light on policy detail but is expected to target a handful of House and Senate seats in next year’s midterm elections, where the sitting Republican voted for Trump’s bill after preaching fiscal responsibility.
“Elon Musk’s America Party is a wild card that could upend the midterms in 2026, particularly for Republicans,” said political analyst Matt Shoemaker, a former Republican congressional candidate and an ex-intelligence officer.
“With bare majorities in Congress, the Republicans should be worried.”
Musk, the world’s richest person, had teased the idea of a new party for weeks, running an informal social media poll in June that showed 80 per cent support among 5.6 million respondents.
 






Unlike previous third parties, his would have almost limitless resources, and a talisman with a large constituency of young American men who see him as a maverick genius and a superstar.
“Musk’s brand appeals to disaffected independents and younger, tech-savvy voters who might otherwise break for Republicans in swing districts,” Shoemaker told AFP.
‘Balance of power’
With a personal wealth estimated at $405 billion, Musk has already demonstrated that he is willing to spend big on politics, lavishing $277m on Trump’s 2024 campaign.
Yet a more recent foray into Wisconsin politics — he spent $20m only to see his candidate for the state supreme court lose handily — has underlined the limits of wealth and celebrity in politics.
And then there is the political difficulty of building support in the American heartland, among voters who are not part of Musk’s Silicon Valley “tech bro” bubble.
Time magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year was once liked by a broad cross-section of Americans, but he saw his numbers plunge after joining the Trump administration as the president’s costcutter-in-chief.
Musk’s net favourability in the most recent rating published by Nate Silver, one of the most respected US pollsters, is underwater at -18.1, compared with a slightly less subaquatic -6.6 for Trump7.
“While you don’t want to paint with too broad a brush, the Republican base and MAGA movement are fairly inseparable in today’s political climate,” said Flavio Hickel, associate professor of political science at Washington College in Maryland.
“And their support for Trump has been unwavering despite recent controversies. It’s hard to imagine any political project associated with Musk syphoning off votes from individuals who approve of Donald Trump.”
‘Fizzled out’
While multiple Republicans and Democrats have switched to independent, wins for third parties have been rare in modern US history.
The Conservative Party of New York State in the 1970s and the Farmer-Labor Party in the 1930s are the only minor parties to win Senate seats in the last century.
Smaller parties saw more success in the House in the early 20th century but have only won one seat since the 1950s.
AFP spoke to multiple analysts who pointed to the many hurdles thrown in front of third-party candidates trying to get onto the ballot in a system designed to favour the status quo.
These include minimum signature requirements, filing fees and other onerous state-specific regulations on age, residency and citizenship.
“Remember in early 2024 the so-called ‘No Labels’ party that was going to chart a middle course for the 2024 elections?” said veteran political strategist Matt Klink.
“They fizzled out in epic fashion.”
Analysts agree that winning seats in Congress may be a stretch, but say Musk can inflict pain on Trump by syphoning votes from vulnerable sitting Republicans or throwing cash at primary opponents of the president’s preferred candidates.
“Elon’s party won’t win seats, but it could cost Republicans plenty,” said Evan Nierman, the founder and CEO of global crisis PR firm Red Banyan.
“In tight districts, even a few points syphoned off from the right could flip control.”</p><small>2025-07-08 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612947-ttp-a-global-threat-pakistan-warns-un-of-afghanistan-becoming-breeding-ground-for-terror' target='_blank'><strong>'TTP a global threat': Pakistan warns UN of Afghanistan becoming breeding ground for terror</strong></a><br><p>

Two others sustained injuries, one of them critically.
In a related development, the Lahore investigation SSP suspended an investigator for allegedly misbehaving with the victim’s family when they approached him for the timely postmortem examination of the body.
The accident came to the limelight when footage of the car went viral on social media.
According to police, the underage driver, identified as Hashir Ali — a Grade 7 student — was driving at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he struck the motorcycles. The deceased was identified as Malik Amin, while his brother Malik Farid was among the injured.

Investigator suspended for ‘misbehaviour with victim’s family’

The injured were rushed to a local hospital where the condition of one of them was stated to be critical due to head injuries.
After receipt of information, SP Bilal Ahmad and other police officials rushed to the site, got the underage driver arrested and seized the car.
The police expanded the scope of investigation, examined the nearby cameras installed privately and those managed by the Safe City Authority besides reaching to the family of the arrested boy.
Sharing details of the initial findings, the SP said Hashir was living with his maternal grandmother after the separation of his parents following domestic issues.
He said Hashir’s mother had contracted a second marriage while his father, who runs a private business, left him to be looked after by his (boy’s) grandmother.
The grandmother of the boy was living in a rented house, Bilal said, adding that on Sunday night Hashir picked up the keys of the car.
The car belonged to the owner of the house Khurram Ijaz who was holding a key position at a pharmaceutical company.
The SP added Khurram Ijaz had gone to the house of his sister in Ravi Road area at the time when Hashir took his car to the road.
He said the teen first hit a cyclist after exiting the parking stand and then ran over three motorbikes.
The boy escaped unhurt in the accident which, however, led to the death of a young man on the spot and injuries to two others.
“We immediately seized the car, arrested the underage driver and lodged a case against him,” the SP said adding that the case was transferred to the investigation wing police for further action.
There were reports that the victim’s family and other local residents lodged a protest outside the Shahdara Town police station alleging that the investigation officer misbehaved with the complainant of the FIR when he demanded autopsy of the body.
Lahore Investigation SSP Mohammad Naveed confirmed to Dawn saying the investigator mishandled the matter when the complainant approached him.
Following the complaint, he said, he ordered immediate suspension of investigation the officer and reassigned the case to the investigation station in-charge for further proceedings.
 
 

UNDERAGE DRIVING: In the past, a fatal accident which claimed lives of six members of a family, including two infants and two women in Defence Phase 7 in Nov 2023, had sparked outrage when a speeding car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle.
The family was reportedly returning home in two cars after visiting relatives in Shadab Colony on Ferozpur Road. As they reached near a roundabout, the car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle. The collision was so intense that the vehicle overturned and was badly damaged.
This incident had led to a high-level meeting in the Lahore police where the senior police officers issued an order for action at a large-scale against the rash and reckless driving, particularly by the underage.

• In meeting with Sharjeel, minister praises Sindh govt for effective Muharram security
KARACHI: Acknowledging the growing number of visa rejections faced by Pakistani citizens, particularly the business community, by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has said that he will raise the issue with his UAE counterpart this week and is hopeful that the matter will be resolved.
He expressed these views while talking to representatives of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) here on Monday.
Upon his arrival at the KCCI, the minister was warmly welcomed by the office-bearers and leading members of the city’s business community, who briefed him on several issues, including law and order, street crime, water shortages, smuggling, narcotics and encroachments.
The minister assured them that the government was working hard to address all these issues on a priority basis.
About the visa problems, he said that he will be meeting with the interior minister of the UAE a day after tomorrow and he will enlighten him about the severity of the issue.
Mr Naqvi highlighted the government’s efforts to improve the global ranking of the Pakistani passport. “We are proud of our green passport, and in the future, it will be a source of even greater pride.”
He also praised the performance of the Sindh police, noting that the law and order situation in the city has significantly improved compared to the past, with a noticeable reduction in crime. “If Karachi is healthy, Pakistan will be healthy,” he remarked.
Regarding smuggling, Mr Naqvi said that the government has made considerable progress in curbing illegal trade. “A few years ago, even the dollar was being smuggled from here, but the situation has improved, and further measures are underway,” he said.
However, he clarified that while smuggling had not been completely eradicated, it has been significantly reduced.
He also stressed the importance of the Safe City Project in curbing crimes, calling it a key initiative endorsed by the prime minister.
He mentioned Faisalabad as a successful model where the project has led to a decline in overall crimes and expressed his hope that similar efforts would be intensified in Karachi.
On the issue of verifying potential employees’ criminal backgrounds, the minister said the government will work with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to streamline ID and SIM card verification, enabling businesses to make informed hiring decisions.
Addressing the problem of encroachments, the minister called for strict legislation, including penalties and fines, to effectively deal with the issue.
BMG chairman Zubair Motiwala, vice chairman Anjum Nisar, KCCI President Javed Bilwani and others were present on the occasion.
Earlier, Mr Motiwala termed land grabbing Karachi’s biggest challenge and criticised the revival of questionable police practices.
He appealed for surprise inspections of police stations and stressed police reforms, emphasising merit-based promotions and better salaries.
Commissioning ceremony of new boats
Also on Monday, the interior minister attended the commissioning ceremony of two new RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats) inducted into the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) fleet at Karachi Port.
Upon his arrival, he was warmly received by PCG Director General Major General Jawad Riaz.
The ceremony was attended by senior military and civil officials, members of the international community and notable personalities from various walks of life.
Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister lauded the professionalism and performance of the coast guards, stating that it is the only force in the country that operates simultaneously on both land and sea to prevent smuggling, illegal immigration, and anti-trawling fishing activities.
He noted that the induction of the two new boats will significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the force and contribute to curbing illicit activities.
Visits Sharjeel’s residence
Mr Naqvi visited the residence of Sindh’s Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
The meeting between the two leaders included a detailed discussion on the country’s important political issues.
The meeting included a detailed discussion on the relations between the federation and the provinces, and joint efforts to ensure national peace and stability.
Both agreed that all political forces must work together to address the challenges facing the country, in the interest of national unity and public welfare.
The interior minister appreciated the security arrangements made by the provincial government and police during Muharram.

Among the dead were at least 27 girls and counsellors who were staying at a youth summer camp on a river when disaster struck over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Forecasters have warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground, complicating recovery efforts involving helicopters, boats, dogs and some 1,750 personnel.
“There is still a threat of heavy rain with the potential to cause flooding,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday, with the number of victims expected to rise still.
President Donald Trump confirmed he planned to visit Texas on Friday, as the White House slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.
“Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.
She said the National Weather Service, which The New York Times reported had several key roles in Texas unfilled before the floods, issued “timely and precise forecasts and warnings.”
 
 

Trump has described the floods that struck in the early hours of Friday as a “100-year catastrophe” that “nobody expected.” The president, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, has signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh federal funds and freeing up resources.
‘Tragedy’
At least 104 flood-related deaths were reported across central Texas.
Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff’s office.
The toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck.
Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”
But some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas — where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”
Experts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of “warning dissemination.” San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson—  who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic — launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.
“Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,” she told AFP.
At a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.
“I was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,” said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.
“Hopefully there’s preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.”
Two-story building
In a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.
Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.
Volunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.
“We’re helping the parents of two of the missing children,” Louis Deppe, 62, told AFP. “The last message they got was ‘We’re being washed away,’ and the phone went dead.”
Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.
The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) — more than a two-story building – in just 45 minutes.
Flash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall.
Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.</p><small>2025-07-08 04:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08092139de689bd.jpg?r=092143' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922704/ihc-to-hear-pti-p-challenge-to-ecp-notification-today' target='_blank'><strong>IHC to hear PTI-P challenge to ECP notification today</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islam­a­bad High Court (IHC) on Tues­day will hear a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Par­lia­mentarians (PTI-P) seeking suspension of the Election Com­­­mission of Pakistan’s (ECP) July 2 notification allocating 21 reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly.
The PTI-P, led by Pervaiz Khat­tak, has accused the ECP of unlawfully depriving it of its rightful share of reserved seats by relying on an allegedly in­­correct count of general seats won by PTI-P in the February 8 elections.
The petition argues that if the notified lawmakers are al­­lowed to take oath and participate in the assembly, it would cause “irreversible prejudice” and render PTI-P’s main constitutional petition ineffective.
The PTI-P contends that the ECP’s March 4 notification erroneously recorded the party as having won only one general seat in KP, when in fact it had won two — PK-73 and PK-103. This miscalculation, the party says, resulted in the loss of at least three reserved seats for women and non-Muslims that should have been allocated to PTI-P under the system of proportional representation.
Despite this discrepancy, the ECP went on to issue the July 2 notification allocating the reserved seats based on what PTI-P describes as a “fundamentally flawed” premise.
The dispute over the allocation of reserved seats had also been under review in the Pe­­shawar High Court. The PHC had initially granted a stay on the oath-taking process on the petition filed by PTI-P.
However, during a subseq­u­e­nt hearing, a two-member PHC bench comprising Just­i­c­­es Syed Arshad Ali and Dr Khu­­rshid Iqbal questioned how PTI-P could maintain litigation in PHC while a similar matter was pending before the IHC.
The PTI-P’s counsel, Advocate Sultan Mohammad Khan, later informed the court that the parliamentary leader Arbab Mohammad Waseem, who had filed the PHC petition, was unaware of the IHC proceedings.
Following this clarification, the PTI-P chose to withdraw its petition, and the PHC bench dismissed the plea and recalled the stay order granted on July 1.

Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir removed the officials and ordered a “transparent investigation… to identify all those involved in this illegal practice and ensure they are held accountable under the law.”
Mr Rind emphasised that the misuse of public resources is unacceptable and that the government is pursuing a zero-tolerance policy on this matter.
“The law is equal for everyone, and any abuse of authority will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said.
The government is implementing stricter measures to ensure the honest and efficient use of public assets and to keep state machinery dedicated to serving the public, Mr Rind said.
He affirmed that action will be taken against anyone found guilty, in line with the administration’s commitment to transparent governance and accountability.
Law challenged
Separately, former senator Nawabzada Haji Lashkari Khan Raisani on Monday challenged the recently passed Mines and Minerals Act 2025 in the Balochistan High Court, claiming it undermines local rights and was passed by an “illegitimate assembly”.
Mr Raisani filed the constitutional petition, which was submitted on his behalf by Supreme Court Advocate Muha­mmad Riaz Ahmed.
The JUI-F and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party have already filed separate petitions and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal has announced its intent to do the same.
After filing the petition, Mr Raisani told the media he contested the legitimacy of the assembly that passed the law, calling it a “dummy house” formed through a “hybrid political plan”.
“This Act, morally, has no weight as it has no mandate of the real representatives of the public,” Mr Raisani said.
He claimed the act was being used to grant resource rights to outside interests, endangering the province’s future.
“It is legalised plunder, endangering the rights of future generations,” Mr Raisani said.
He alleged that 17 land allotments comprising millions of acres in areas including Qila Abdullah, Zhob, Chagai and Washuk had already been made to non-local people under the new law.
The senior politician framed the issue as one of existential importance for the region.

“The federal cabinet has formally approved the summary for the creation of the PVARA, a landmark step towards establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for overseeing the country’s rapidly growing digital assets ecosystem”, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance.
“The cabinet’s approval is a critical inflexion point in this journey. Once legislated, the authority will be responsible for issuing licences, supervising VASPs, setting technical standards, and coordinating compliance with FATF, IMF, and World Bank guidelines,” the statement said, adding that it will also oversee public protection mechanisms, anti-money laundering protocols, and cyber risk mitigation across all virtual asset transactions within the country.
This coordinated approach, combining sovereign asset reserves, surplus energy deployment and robust regulation, reflects Pakistan’s ambition to become a digital assets hub in South Asia. By building trust, attracting foreign investment, and fostering innovation in the blockchain sector, Pakistan is setting the foundations for a secure, inclusive, and future-proof digital economy, the statement added.

New authority to licence and monitor crypto platforms under FATF guidelines

This milestone comes less than four months after the launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on March 14, which marked the beginning of a new era in Pakistan’s digital finance journey, the statement said, adding that since then the PCC has led a nationwide push to regulate and enable blockchain technology, digital currencies, and tokenized assets in a responsible and innovation-friendly manner.
The PCC also welcomed international blockchain leaders and experts, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, as strategic advisors to help shape Pakistan’s regulatory outlook.
The council consists of key institutional stakeholders, including the of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan chairman, the State Bank governor, federal secretaries of Law and Information Technology divisions to ensure a whole-of-government approach to digital asset regulation.
This was followed by an announcement on May 28 —  by Bilal Bin Saqib, the PCC chief executive at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas — to form Pakistan’s first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a sovereign reserve intended to hold Bitcoin for long-term national benefit and macroeconomic resilience.
Further advancing this momentum, the government announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, leveraging Pakistan’s untapped energy potential to power the future of digital finance and computation. Strategic partnerships are underway to ensure that energy-intensive blockchain infrastructure is both sustainable and revenue-generating, the MoF said.
Pakistan is emerging as one of the most promising frontier markets for digital assets, with over 40 million crypto users and an estimated annual trading volume of $300 billion, according to industry sources. Despite previous regulatory ambiguity, Pakistani youth have been early adopters of blockchain technologies, with over 70pc of the population under the age of 30.

• Wants authorities to put an end to such practices
ISLAMABAD: Highlighting the legal and ethical ramifications of media coverage during criminal investigations, the Supreme Court on Monday urged media professionals to exercise responsibility in order to safeguard the rights of both the accused and victims while reporting on criminal proceedings.
“A disproportionate and excessive media spotlight and the manner it is presented is likely to create perceptions of guilt and influence the public as well as those who are associated with the criminal proceedings,” observed Justice Athar Minallah in a 25-page judgement.
Justice Minallah headed a three-judge bench that took up the appeal of accused Shahid Ali against the March 15, 2021, decision of the Sindh High Court which had upheld the death sentence earlier awarded by the trial court.
The case involved the gruesome murder of a seven-year-old boy, Wasim Akram, in Karachi. The boy’s body was discovered in a water tank on March 9, 2014. The appellant, Shahid Ali, was convicted under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to death by the trial court. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him, extending the benefit of doubt, and directed that he be released forthwith.
The controversy arose when a journalist interviewed the appellant while he was on physical remand and in the custody of the investigating officer (IO). This interview was later aired on a private television channel on March 27, 2014, in its programme Jurm Bolta Hai.
Calling the case a classic example, the judgement pointed out that the accused was in custody under a court-ordered physical remand solely for investigation purposes. He was presumed to be innocent, but the in-charge of the police station and the IO granted a journalist access to interview him in custody.
The statement was recorded on camera and disseminated to the general public via the television broadcast. The judgement expressed concern for the victim’s family, who may also have been adversely affected by this act.
The court found that the police officials had adopted a process they were presumed to know was unlawful and one that could lead to grave violations of the rights of the accused. Their actions created a perception of guilt, despite the fact that the accused was in custody solely for investigation and had not yet been charged, nor had the investigation concluded.

Takes notice of broadcast of interview with accused in custody

The inadmissible purported confession was broadcast to the public, the judgement said, even though the accused had not been produced before a competent magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure
Code (CrPC).
The judgement also criticised the frequent practice of electronic media showing accused persons paraded before cameras or being questioned by reporters while in custody. Such practices gravely violate the rights of the accused and undermine the fairness of criminal trials, the court observed.
The court emphasised that both federal and provincial governments must take immediate and effective measures to ensure such practices come to an end.
The judgement also reminded the media — both print and electronic — of their responsibility to self-regulate their reporting and adopt standard operating procedures aligned with international best practices.
It called on regulatory authorities to propose such SOPs in consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of protecting the rights of the parties involved, particularly during investigations.
The court ordered its office to dispatch copies of the judgement to the interior and information secretaries, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), and the chief secretaries of the provinces, directing them to take immediate steps to protect the rights of those involved in criminal proceedings and to safeguard the integrity and fairness of investigations and trials.

Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, told the General Assembly that these groups were operating from ungoverned spaces inside Afghanistan.
His warning came amid a surge in terrorist violence in Pakistan in recent weeks. On June 28, a suicide attacker rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a military convoy in North Waziristan, killing 16 soldiers and injuring several civilians. Days later, five senior officials — including an Assistant Commissioner — were killed in Bajaur when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle during a routine visit.
Ambassador Ahmad noted that many of these attacks are carried out with sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by international forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“These weapons have been used by Afghan-based terrorists to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks against Pakistan, including in the last two weeks,” he said.
Pakistan’s envoy said that the TTP, with an estimated 6,000 fighters, was the largest UN-designated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil, and poses a threat, not just to Pakistan, but to regional and global stability as well. He also identified other groups active in Afghanistan, including IS-Khorasan, Al Qaeda, and various Baloch separatist factions.
“We must ensure that Afghanistan does not become a breeding ground for terrorists that threaten its neighbours and the broader international community,” he said, urging the United Nations and regional powers to act against “spoilers” who could reignite conflict in the region.
 






Secretary-level talks
Meanwhile, Kabul and Islamabad held their first-ever additional secretary-level talks on Monday, in line with the agreement reached during Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Afghanistan in April.
Additional Secretary (Afghanistan & West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani represented the Pakistani side while the Afghan side was led by First Political Division DG at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor. The two sides discussed trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity, the FO statement said.
Both sides also termed terrorism a serious threat to regional peace and agreed the region can’t develop without addressing security issues. Emphasising the need for “concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil”, the Pakistani delegation noted that such groups undermine the security and hinder regional development.
The meeting also reviewed measures to boost trade, including the facilitation of Afghan transit trade, the removal of 10 per cent processing fee, provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination, and operationalisation of the track and trace system.

• Countries aligning with BRICS threatened with steeper tariffs
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25 per cent on Japan and South Korea on Monday, stepping up pressure on the two key US allies and a dozen other economies to reach trade deals with Washington.
Trump issued similar letters to Malaysia, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Laos, saying he would slap duties on their products ranging from 25pc to 40pc.
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump would sign an executive order later in the day to delay his original July 9 deadline for steeper tariffs to take effect — postponing their imposition to August 1.
Besides Japan and South Korea, she added, there would be approximately 12 other partners receiving letters from Trump soon.
With the deadline extension, Leavitt noted that Trump would set out the “reciprocal tariff rate” for partners in the coming month as negotiations continue.
Asked why Trump opted to start with South Korea, Leavitt said: “It’s the President’s prerogative, and those are the countries he chose.”
“This announcement will send a chilling message to others,” said Asia Society Policy Institute Vice President Wendy Cutler, referring to Trump’s initial announcements on Tokyo and Seoul.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believed there would be a number of deals coming up: “We are going to have several announcements in the next 48 hours.”
Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on imports from almost all trading partners in early April, but some economies including the European Union were slated to have this rate increase further. As markets plunged at the time, Trump halted the steeper levies to allow for talks. That pause expires on Wednesday.
‘Anti-American policies’
Also, in a social media post on Monday, Trump threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they slammed his duties at a summit.
 

Screengrab from Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump

On Sunday, BRICS leaders described Trump’s stop-start tariff wars as “indiscriminate”, damaging, and illegal, drawing a quick rebuke from the pugilistic US president.
The 11-nation grouping — which also includes US allies Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia — is concluding a two-day summit in Rio de Janeiro.
BRICS members account for about half the world’s population and 40pc of global economic output.
Some US allies inside the bloc had tried to blunt criticism by not mentioning Trump by name in their summit statement.
Saudi Arabia — one of the world’s biggest purchasers of US high-tech weapons — even kept its foreign minister away from Sunday’s talks and a BRICS “family photo” of leaders, seemingly to avoid Washington’s ire.
Climate financing
Earlier, the leaders of the BRICS addressed the shared challenges of global warming on Monday, the final day of their summit in Rio de Janeiro, demanding that wealthy nations fund mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in poorer nations.
In his opening remarks, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva blasted denialism of the climate emergency, indirectly criticising President Trump’s decision to pull his country out of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
“The Global South is in a position to lead a new development paradigm without repeating the mistakes of the past.”
A joint statement from BRICS leaders released on Sunday argued that petroleum will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix, particularly in developing economies.
In their joint statement, BRICS leaders also underscored that providing climate finance “is a responsibility of developed countries towards developing countries,” which is the standard position for emerging economies in global negotiations.
The BRICS leaders also blasted policies such as carbon border taxes and anti-deforestation laws, which Europe recently adopted, for imposing what they called “discriminatory protectionist measures” under the pretext of environmental concerns.

The latest round of negotiations on the war in Gaza began on Sunday in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of Israeli prisoners in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told AFP a second session was held on Monday and ended with “no breakthrough”.
The Hamas and Israeli delegations were due to resume talks later on Monday, the official said.

Palestinian group’s response to US-backed ceasefire proposal, had ‘unacceptable’ demands, says Israeli PM

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the delegations had exchanged views on Sunday via mediators, with representatives of the two sides seated in different rooms in the same building.
Ahead of Netanyahu’s third visit since Trump’s return to office this year, the US president said there was a “good chance we have a deal with Hamas… during the coming week”.
“We’ve gotten a lot of the out, but pertaining to the remaining [prisoners], quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.
Netanyahu, speaking before heading to Washington, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal after 21 months of war.
Netanyahu said he had dispatched the team to the Qatari capital with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to”.
He previously said Hamas’s response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.
Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions had earlier told AFP the proposal included a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release 10 living Israeli prisoners and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.
However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.
 
 

Trump is scheduled to meet the Israeli premier on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.
In Israel’s coastal hub of Tel Aviv, hours before the meeting, an AFP photographer said dozens of people including relatives of Israeli prisoners demonstrated to demand their release.
“President Trump — make history. Bring them all home. End the war,” read a sign held by protesters outside the US diplomatic mission in the city.
Of the 251 Israeli prisoners taken by Palestinian fighters during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, but the Israeli military believes that 27 of them are dead.
Recent efforts to broker a truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.
In Gaza, the civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 12 people on Monday, including six in a clinic housing people displaced by the war.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean media are unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
Salman Qudum, who survived the attack on the clinic in Gaza City, said: “We don’t know where to go or what to do.” Qudum said the negotiators and mediators in Doha must “apply pressure” to secure a ceasefire “because the people can’t take this anymore”.
In a statement on Monday, the Israeli military claimed it had struck “dozens of terrorists, weapons depots, observation posts, military buildings and other terror infrastructures” across Gaza over the past 24 hours.
The war has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.
A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.
 
 

But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers killed near its facilities while awaiting rations.

• Muqam says no plan to roll back merger; federation has ‘responsibility to solve provincial problems’
ISLAMABAD: As a committee formed by the prime minister to bring reforms in the ex-Fata region met on Monday, the PTI leaders called out the federal government for alleged attempts to roll back the merger of the tribal districts, with the committee convenor Amir Muqam shooting down these claims as exaggerated.
The committee was formed last month apparently to revive the ‘jirga system’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for an ‘effective alternate dispute mechanism’.
It is supposed to examine proposals for the revival of the jirga system and strengthening of the civil administration in the province. Headed by PML-N’s Amir Muqam, its members are Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The PTI, however, boycotted the Monday meeting and held a press conference instead, rejecting the committee as a “blatant constitutional violation” and “a political stunt to undermine provincial autonomy”. It said the body should be dissolved immediately. The PTI said the Centre through its actions was undermining provincial autonomy and asked the federal government to focus on paying over Rs700 billion owed to tribal districts.
In a joint press conference, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, flanked by party leaders Shah Farman, Sheikh Waqas Akram, and Iqbal Afridi, said that this was the second meeting of the ‘jirga committee’, but 14 out of 17 MPAs from ex-Fata were not part of the proceedings. He said this was a direct violation of constitutional and democratic rights.
The PTI leaders reiterated that following the 25th Constitutional Amendment, Fata had been merged into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and must be governed through its elected provincial representatives, not the federal nominees. Former KP governor Shah Farman warned against attempts to revive the colonial-era governance system, such as the draconian Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR).
“The federal government is staging all this drama to reassert control, using tools like the Mines and Minerals Bill to hijack provincial resources,” he alleged.
Iqbal Afridi, a former MNA from the tribal region, accused the federal government of fiscal discrimination. “Islamabad is taxing the people of Fata without providing them with their due share of funds and the new committee headed by a federal minister has no legal standing: it must be dissolved immediately,” he added.
Mr Akram said the committee was an attempt of intimidation. “This is not consultation—it’s coercion. The real ‘jirga’ already exists in the form of elected representatives. Fata’s people know how to protect their rights,” he stated.
However, PML-N’s Muqam, who heads the committee, hit back at the PTI in a press conference after the second meeting of the body. The Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan & States and Frontier Regions minister refuted the allegations that the government was planning to take back the administrative control of Fata from KP.
“Talks about ending the Fata merger are not true; FCR was a cruel and outdated law, and it was abolished by the PML-N,” he said, and emphasised that the merger should move forward under a unified national vision.
Highlighting the role of the federal government, the PML-N leader noted that, “Although it is being said this was a provincial matter, the federation has a responsibility to help solve provincial problems too.”
The minister commented that the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) representatives had participated in the committee meeting and said that JUI-F had its own position regarding the tribal districts. “But the goal should be collective national progress and it was disappointing that the PTI remained absent from the meeting; this is not responsible behaviour,” he added.
“Their members confirmed the participation in last night’s communication but later changed their minds, as the PTI members participated in the previous committee meetings they should have come to present their stance this time too,” he added.
Mr Muqam also clarified that the 18th Amendment was not being abolished, adding that the federal government wanted to work for Fata’s development within the current system.
In response to a question about whether the Centre planned to topple the KP government, the minister stated, “There is a time for everything, everything can happen — but there is no such plan for now.”
The erstwhile Fata comprised Bajaur Agency, Mohmand Agency, Khyber Agency, Orakzai Agency, Kurram Agency, North Waziristan Agency and South Waziristan Agency, which were converted into tribal districts and merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 through a constitutional amendment. Before that, these agencies were semi-autonomous regions administered directly by the federal government under the FCR.

In a notification, the finance ministry said that an earlier order dated July 10, 2014 which capped earnings through board meetings of corporate entities at Rs1 million per annum, stood “withdrawn ab-initio” — meaning it was never issued.
The order, issued on June 12, 2024 with the approval of the then-federal cabinet, said that “government servants appointed to the board of companies/organisations and who become entitled to [a] fee, shall only be allowed to retain remuneration to a maximum of Rs1m in a financial year”.
Any amount in excess of Rs1m so received was required to be deposited by the officer in the government treasury.
The decision on capping meeting fees was originally announced by then finance minister Ishaq Dar almost a decade ago.
That order remained in the field for a couple of years and then ignored. It was categorically reiterated last year, but has now been ‘withdrawn ab-initio’, meaning that the amounts earned throughout FY2024-25 would become legalised as the earnings of those officers.
The finance ministry issued another notification for continuation of austerity measures, which have now also been extended to federal government’s attached departments, SOEs and statutory bodies including regulatory authorities.
In case of SOEs, “these austerity measures shall be considered a direction of the federal government under Section 35 of the SOEs (Governance & Operations) Act 2023 and under the relevant sections of their respective organic laws in the case of statutory bodies”, the notification said.
The restrictions include a complete ban on purchase of all types of vehicles. The ban also includes creation of new posts, treatment abroad and non-obligatory foreign visits at government expense.
Separately, the ministry also notified an increase of 7pc in net pension of all civil pensioners, including civilians paid from defense estimates, as well as retired armed forces personnel and civil armed forces personnel.

• KP records six deaths in Malakand, Karak, Buner and Manshera
• PM orders authorities to remain on their toes as NEOC forecasts ‘moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall’ till 10th
ISLAMABAD: Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather.
Moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected till July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC. The alert also prompted the prime minister to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other authorities to remain on high alert to deal with potential emergency situations, particularly floods.
In Balochistan, at least seven people were killed and many others were injured as a result of the fresh monsoon spell over the past 48 hours, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. Almost 22 districts of Balochistan have been affected by the rain, and PDMA has already issued an alert of heavy rains and flash floods. The PDMA confirmed seven deaths. It said that 22 houses were damaged while five houses were destroyed.
The areas which were badly affected by the monsoon spell included Awaran, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Musakhail, Qila Saif­ullah, Barkhan, Kohlu, Loralai, and parts of Zhob and Sherani districts. “At least 22 districts of northern, southern and central Balochistan were affected while the monsoon spell is continuing in these districts,” said the PDMA officials.
“Washuk district bordering Iran was badly affected, where standing crops were washed away and many houses were damaged, which rendered a large number of people homeless,” officials confirmed and added that the rain also damaged solar panels in Loralai and Surab.
At least six people including three children drowned in rain-related incidents in different parts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, police and emergency services reported.
 
 

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six persons lost their lives in Malakand, Buner, Manshera and Karak districts.
PM Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Authority, rescue agencies, and adm­inistrative authorities to remain on high alert to cope with any potential emergency.
He also expressed concern that the operation of the Tarbela Dam spillways may increase flooding in the lower districts along the Indus River.
Potential riverine flooding
According to NEOC’s forecast, increased water flows are expected in all major rivers, including Kabul, Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab. Currently, low flood levels are being observed at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma on the Indus River, while Taunsa is also expected to reach the low flood mark. River Chenab is likely to experience low flood levels at Marala and Khanki stations. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to rise to low flood levels, while Swat and Panjkora Rivers, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their catchment areas. River Jhelum, along with its tributaries, is expected to experience elevated inflows, resulting in localised flash floods. Inflows at Mangla Dam on River Jhelum are projected to reach the low flood limit.
Hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts may once again become active, generating medium to high flows.
In Balochistan, nullahs and seasonal streams in the northeastern districts, including Jhal Magsi, Kachi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhail are also likely to experience high flows.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Hunza and Shigar rivers may see increased water discharge.

The talks are the latest in a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the upgrading of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador.
According to a press release from the Foreign Office, the Pakistani delegation was led by Additional Secretary (Afghanistan and West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani, while the Afghan side was led by the Director General of the First Political Division at the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor.
 
“Discussions covered key areas of bilateral interest, including trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity. Both sides recognised terrorism as a serious threat to regional peace and security. The Pakistani side emphasised the need for concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil, noting that such groups undermine Pakistan’s security and hinder regional development.”
 
According to the FO, both sides discussed deepening trade and transit cooperation and reviewed the implementation of measures announced to facilitate Afghan transit trade during the April visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul, including the removal of a 10 per cent processing fee, the provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination and making the track and trace system operational.
 
The delegations “underlined the importance of enhanced regional connectivity as a catalyst for sustainable growth and shared prosperity”, the FO said, adding that they agreed to work towards finalising the framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway.
 
“The two sides also discussed matters related to the repatriation of Afghan nationals,” the FO said.
 






According to the statement, Pakistan highlighted its efforts to facilitate documented travel from Afghanistan through the issuance of over 500,000 visas across a range of categories, such as medical, tourist, business, and study, from January 2024 till now.
“Both sides agreed to work together to further strengthen the legal movement of individuals across borders,” the press release read.
 
The delegations reaffirmed their commitment to sustaining engagement and addressing mutual challenges, the FO said.
“They recognised lasting security as a cornerstone for both the region’s optimal development as well as for further advancement of bilateral relations.”
 
The delegations decided to convene the next round of additional-secretary talks at mutually convenient dates.</p><small>2025-07-07 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612896-pakistan-afghanistan-to-further-strengthen-legal-movement-across-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan to further strengthen legal movement across borders</strong></a><br><p>

Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.
The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.
Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.
Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.
The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had said the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.
President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612887-president-notifies-appointment-of-chief-justices-for-all-four-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>President notifies appointment of chief justices for all four high courts</strong></a><br><p>
