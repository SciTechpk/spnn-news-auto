The passenger, flying from Srinagar to Delhi, left the staff with severe injuries after allegedly attacking them with punches, kicks and even a queue stand.
“The airline says its staff members ‘suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries’,” TOI reported.

The outlet added that the passenger was carrying two pieces of cabin luggage weighing 16 kilogrammes — more than double the allowed 7kg limit. When asked to pay a baggage fee by airline staff, he “refused and forcefully boarded the aerobridge without completing the boarding process”.
“He was escorted back to the gate by a CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) official,” TOI reported, quoting a spokesperson for Indian airline SpiceJet. “At the gate, the passenger grew increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted four members of the SpiceJet ground staff.
“One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor, but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee,” the spokesperson continued.
“Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.”
According to the spokesperson, the injured staff were rushed to the hospital, where they are still receiving treatment for their injuries.
“The matter involving an alleged altercation between an Army personnel [sic] and airline staff at Srinagar Airport on July 26 has come to the notice of the Indian Army,” TOI reported quoting a statement from the Indian military.
“The Indian Army is committed to uphold highest standards of discipline and conduct and takes all allegations seriously. Full cooperation is being extended to the authorities in investigating the case.”
Meanwhile, SpiceJet, which registered a first information report (FIR) with the local police, said it has initiated the process to put the passenger on the no-fly list.
“SpiceJet has written to the aviation ministry, appraising them about the murderous assault on its staff and has requested appropriate action against the passenger,” the airline’s spokesperson said.
“The airline has secured the CCTV footage of the incident from the airport authorities and handed it over to the police.”
According to Indian daily The Hindu, the officer, a lieutenant colonel, was nominated in an FIR registered at Budgam police station.</p><small>2025-08-03 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/032211245d9e253.jpg?r=221236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928506/imran-not-leaving-the-country-says-kp-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Imran ‘not leaving the country’, says KP CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Sunday dismissed rumours of PTI founder Imran Khan leaving the country under a deal, describing them as attempts to weaken the provincial government.
According to a statement issued today by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Niyazi, Gandapur also rubbished media reports that Imran had asked him to resign from his post as chief minister if he was unable to keep the peace in KP.
The PTI founder said in a “clear message” to Gandapur a day prior that the federation should not be allowed to conduct another military operation in the province and its tribal areas.
Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region.
“Chief Minister Gandapur has said that the PTI founder Imran Khan will never leave Pakistan,” the statement read. “If he (Imran) had to make a deal, he would have done so by now.”
The focal person’s statement added that Imran never expressed any desire to leave the country.
“The assumptions that are being made that Imran Khan will go abroad are just an attempt to weaken the movement and damage Khan’s position,” it clarified.
The statement continued: “Ali Amin Khan Gandapur said, ’Imran Khan has made me the chief minister. His trust is with me.
“Khan sahib has the government, he has the command, and we are all trying our best to deal with the challenges of the province effectively according to his vision’,”.
The statement further read: “Along with our movement, there is also an administrative responsibility, which we are paying full attention to.”
Gandapur also claimed that rumours are being spread by political opponents to weaken the PTI government in KP and the party’s movement itself.
Yesterday, the CM held the first in a series of jirgas to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
A statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.”
This development comes days before the PTI is due to launch a major protest movement across the country, to mark the second year of Imran’s incarceration in multiple cases and demand his release.</p><small>2025-08-03 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617159-pakistan-iran-reaffirm-resolve-to-further-broaden-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran reaffirm resolve to deepen cooperation across multiple sectors</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade.
According to a statement from the Presidency, both sides “reaffirmed their commitment to further broaden bilateral cooperation in diverse fields” and “emphasised the importance of enhancing bilateral ties in wide-ranging and mutually beneficial areas”.
President Zardari was quoted as saying that Pakistan and Iran enjoy brotherly relations rooted in shared religion, culture and mutual respect.
“The two leaders exchanged views on major regional and international developments and stressed the need for coordinated diplomatic efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts and to promote peace, security, and stability in the region,” the statement added.
The president appreciated Iran’s positions on regional issues and acknowledged the Islamic republic’s consistent support for regional cooperation.
He expressed gratitude for Iran’s solidarity during critical moments, such as the war with India and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to working closely with Tehran for a peaceful and prosperous future.
President Zardari also thanked Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his consistent support for the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir.
“President Zardari strongly condemned the unprovoked Israeli aggression against Iran and lauded the bravery and unity of the Iranian nation during the recent 12‑day war,” the statement added. “He expressed hope that President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit would further solidify the brotherly relations between the two countries.
“President Pezeshkian thanked the leadership and people of Pakistan for their support during the 12‑day war and appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in advocating de‑escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy for the peaceful resolution of disputes,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.
The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian addressing a joint press briefing.
“Both countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,” according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.
Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, attacked Iran’s nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.
“Israel, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.
He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.
 






PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance over Iran’s right to a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.
In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. “If anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,” he said.
The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.
The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.
In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.
He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.
“Advancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran’s foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,” he added.
The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.
President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.
The two countries aslo convened a high-level business forum in Islamabad, attended by President Pezeshkian and other senior officials, aimed at bolstering bilateral trade ties and finalising a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Iranian state-run IRNA reported.
The event, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, brought together a large number of business leaders, chamber of commerce officials, and top investors from Pakistan.
Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, delivering the opening remarks, welcomed the progress towards finalising the FTA, saying both countries are working on resolving tariff issues and enhancing border infrastructure to facilitate trade.
Speaking on the occasion, President Pezeshkian emphasised the necessity of unity and solidarity among Muslims worldwide.
“We must rely on our own capabilities and resources to overcome challenges and achieve development and progress,” he added.
Addressing the forum, Dar welcomed the positive momentum toward finalising the Pakistan-Iran FTA, according to the Foreign Office.
He emphasised that economic diplomacy is a cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy.
“The Pak-Iran FTA and platforms like the Business Forum are vital for strengthening bilateral trade and promoting collaboration across key sectors, including energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and technology,” he said.
 






12 agreements, MoUs exchanged
The two countries exchanged 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for the promotion of bilateral cooperation in diverse fields on Sunday, according to Radio Pakistan.

“The agreements and MoUs included cooperation for plant protection and plant quarantine, joint use of Mirjaveh-Taftan border gate, collaboration in science, technology and innovation, cooperation in information and communications technology,” the report said.
It added that agreements and MoUs were also exchanged to promote culture, art, tourism, youth, mass media and exports, and cooperation in meteorology, climatology and related hazards.
“MoUs on maritime safety and firefighting, judicial assistance in criminal matters, supplemental MoU to an MoU in 2013 related to air services agreement were also signed,” the report said.
The two sides also exchanged MoUs on recognition of product certification, inspection and testing, tourism cooperation for 2025-27 and a joint ministerial statement on the intent to finalise the Free Trade Agreement.
Earlier, upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s House, President Pezeshkian was presented with a guard of honour.

Dar calls on Iranian president
Previously in the day, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on President Pezeshkian and conveyed Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining “brotherly ties” with Iran, according to a statement from the Foreign Office.
 






“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.
President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.
Strengthening bilateral trade
Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.
Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.
“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”
The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.
“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.
Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.
“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.
Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.
Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.
The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.
“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.
Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.
“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot — and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.
He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the Joint Economic Commission (JEC), regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.
Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.
Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.
The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.
“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-08-03 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03213642c33f623.jpg?r=214210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928505/norris-wins-in-hungarian-grand-prix-to-trim-piastri-lead-as-mclaren-reel-off-another-1-2' target='_blank'><strong>Norris wins in Hungarian Grand Prix to trim Piastri lead as McLaren reel off another 1-2</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris trimmed McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri’s lead in the drivers’ world championship to just nine points on Sunday when he switched tactics to lead him home by just 0.698 seconds in a thrilling finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
The 25-year-old Briton, who moved from a two-stop strategy to one stop, held off series leader Piastri, on fresher tyres, over the closing laps of a strategic contest to claim McLaren’s 200th victory and their record 13th win in Hungary.
It was Norris’s first win at the Hungaroring in the event’s 40th race, avenging his ‘team orders’ defeat in 2024 when Piastri claimed his maiden success, his fifth victory of the season and the ninth of his career.
The dominant McLaren pair finished 22 seconds clear of third-placed George Russell of Mercedes, with polesitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari fourth, grumbling at the Italian team’s poor planning after he slipped out of the leading position.
“I wasn’t planning to do a one-stop,” said Norris. “But it was the only option to get back into things and it was tough. Oscar was pushing all the way.”
Piastri said he had done all he could to triumph. “It was great racing,” he said.
“Lando did a great job.”
His drive brought McLaren their fourth consecutive 1-2 finish.
Two-time champion Fernando Alonso came home fifth for Aston Martin ahead of Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto, Lance Stroll in the second Aston Martin, rookie Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls and frustrated four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull.
Mercedes’ rookie Kimi Antonelli was 10th ahead of Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton 12th in the second Ferrari, 24 hours after declaring himself undeserving of their race seat.
Heavy overnight rain had ‘reset’ the track on a breezy afternoon in front of a big crowd at the Hungaroring.
Classic scrap
The track temperature was only 31 degrees, encouraging thoughts of a one-stop race as tyre-wear decreased and Leclerc controlled the pace ahead of Piastri, Russell and Norris.
Piastri pitted on lap 18, seeking an undercut. He returned in fifth as Leclerc responded to stay ahead.
Norris inherited the lead and had a 10-second advantage, as the Monegasque regained second, with Piastri third.
He then chose to stay out until pitting, in just 1.9 seconds, for hards on lap 31, rejoining fourth and facing a long run home.
At the front, Leclerc responded to an apparent ‘bluff’ call from McLaren and pitted, falling to fourth and gifting Piastri the lead ahead of a rapid Norris as the race dissolved into a strategy and tyre-management contest between the two McLarens.
Norris revelled in his delayed one-stop tactic as Piastri made a second pit on lap 45, the Briton leading with a frustrated Ferrari second, Leclerc blaming his team for bungling his plan before being passed by Piastri around Turn One on lap 51.
This left Norris, on ageing tyres, leading his team-mate in a classic scrap to the flag, negotiating traffic and separated by half a second over the final laps. On lap 68, the Australian went close to passing in Turn One and on lap 69, he locked up.
“Remember how we go racing,” Piastri’s engineer Tom Stallard reminded him.
For Leclerc, soon left a distant third by the two McLarens, it was another pole wasted — the 15th time he failed to convert pole into a win in 16 attempts — and it grew worse when Russell, after two attempts, passed him on lap 63.</p><small>2025-08-03 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03212813c253794.jpg?r=212914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine' target='_blank'><strong>Top Trump aide accuses India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine</strong></a><br><p>A top aide to United States President Donald Trump on Sunday accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, after the US leader escalated pressure on New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.
“What he (Trump) said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,” said Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House and one of Trump’s most influential aides.
Miller’s criticism was some of the strongest yet by the Trump administration about one of the United States’ major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
“People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact,” Miller said on Fox News programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures’.
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian government sources told Reuters on Saturday that New Delhi will keep purchasing oil from Moscow despite US threats. A 25 per cent tariff on Indian products went into effect on Friday as a result of its purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia.
Trump has also threatened 100pc tariffs on US imports from countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.
Miller tempered his criticism by noting Trump’s relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he described as “tremendous”.</p><small>2025-08-03 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03192741d95456e.png?r=211548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928496/broken-system-experts-stress-need-for-supportive-legal-civil-forums-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Broken system’: Experts stress need for supportive legal, civil forums in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Experts from various professions assailed systemic injustice in Pakistan on Sunday, stressing the need for legal and civil institutions to be supportive and have a holistic approach.
The observations came during a plenary session of the Imagining Futures Conference, taking place at Karachi’s Habib University from August 1-4, where subject experts and stakeholders discussed human rights and civil liberties in Pakistan.
As the session, brimming with participants of all ages, began exploring Pakistan’s legal landscape, National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairperson Rabiya Javeri highlighted: “Knowledge is capital.”
However, she stressed, people should be aware of their rights but the “system is messed up”.
Responding to a query from the audience about whether knowledge really guaranteed protection if women such as ex-premier Benazir Bhutto and Noor Mukadam could be murdered, Javeri pointed out: “Empowerment through education or skills needs to be integrated into systems […] educational, financial, judicial systems have to support you.”
Only 41 per cent of women raped report it, and even out of those, they back off due to societal pressure, the NCHR chair said. Noting the low rate of conviction in rape cases (0.5pc according to a recent report), she said: “Who will they go to? System hi itna kharab hai, holnaak hai (the system itself is so broken and horrifying).”

“The system has to be responsive,” Javeri stressed, noting the need for human rights impact assessments for projects and systematic and gendered planning in budgets.
She underscored that this aspect needed to be embedded in “service providers”, which include lawyers, courts, police and teachers, among others.
“Human rights are god-given rights. Nobody can take them away.”
Javeri detailed certain cases she had come across during her role at NCHR, including one where a woman had gotten her daughter — a Master’s student in her 30s — abducted and sent to a rehabilitation centre.
The mother’s reason to do so, as told by Javeri, sent shivers down the audience’s spines: the daughter did not want to get married, had cats as pets (as if that’s somehow relevant), and a so-called doctor termed her “depressed”.
The case, Javeri noted, highlighted how ill-equipped responders and people involved in dealing with such situations are. There is a lack of regulation of mental health cases, with every other person presenting themselves as psychologists, and anybody can term someone a “paagal” (mad).
Other speakers on the panel were Police Service of Pakistan’s Superintendent (SP) Amna Baig; Karachi Bar Association Treasurer Haseebullah Panhwar; rights activist and academic Abira Ashfaq; and Air Commodore (retired) Shabbir Ahmed Khan, founder of Rashid Memorial Welfare Organisation. The session was moderated by Rana Kaiser Ishaque from the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.
SP Baig, who was among the first responders who arrested Noor Mukadam’s murderer Zahir Jaffer from the crime scene, pointed out that the case was still being discussed four years later “because she was educated”, compared to other “worse cases” she had seen while serving in Punjab.
 
 

While Baig believed that knowledge empowers people, she also noted that politicians and policymakers did not fully understand social equity.
“If culture is repressive, it will be reflected in your public service systems, such as police,” she said, explaining that approaching a police station was linked to a woman’s dignity in Pakistan.
“It’s how the police and law enforcement agencies have been portrayed over time. [But] there are women on the other side as well,” she assured the women attending the session, and suggested that it should be taught to people how to report to the police.
The police officer brought attention to a lesser-known term — tech-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) — which not only means violence done using technology but also women being killed for even using social media platforms.
An image of a young girl that most people following the news have seen popped up in the audience’s minds; the recent murder of Sana Yousaf that rightly ignited fury among women across the country.
 
 

Ashfaq, a human rights activist and an associate professor at Habib University, took aim at the 26th Amendment, noting it had snatched away the suo motu power that had allowed judges to take notice of public issues.
She also underscored the lack of legal education: “We don’t know how courts, bureaucracy and parliamentary systems function. These are basic things. We haven’t gotten out of slogans to look at economic justice, climate justice.”
“You have rolled back protective laws. We think about taxing property rather than thinking that housing is a right,” Ashfaq pointed out. Similarly, she wondered, “Where is the right to food?”
Meanwhile, Panhwar, ready with his arguments, comprehensively but succinctly listed the troubles afflicting Pakistan’s judicial system.
A serious matter, but an apt chuckle from the audience when the moderator quipped “Pakistan is also a hard state” as Panhwar described the category of local codes as “hard laws”.
The lawyer pointed out that Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution guaranteed several rights such as freedom of expression and movement, and that Pakistan was a signatory to various international conventions, but “we do not see any kind of implementation at all here”.
Without any hesitation, Panhwar called out the “ruling parties” for bringing the 26th Amendment that now gave them more votes to decide who gets to be a judge in the superior courts.
 
 

Retired Air Commodore Ahmed offered some words of wisdom, which one would want to blast on loudspeakers at public service institutions across the country.
The creation of Pakistan has given us complete independence, he said, but “we have denied and killed that over time through our actions and self-interest”.
He stressed, “If we are addressing a problem, then we must address it holistically.”
The retired officer also offered us, and Pakistan, hope: “All negative, all dark. But there is a silver lining; that we are talking about it.”</p><small>2025-08-03 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/031713547787a89.jpg?r=174727' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928493/filmmakers-try-to-cash-in-on-india-pakistan-war' target='_blank'><strong>Filmmakers try to cash in on India-Pakistan war</strong></a><br><p>Indian filmmakers are locking up the rights to movie titles that can profit from the patriotism fanned by a four-day conflict with Pakistan, which killed more than 70 people.
The nuclear-armed rivals exchanged artillery, drone and air strikes in May, after India blamed Pakistan for an armed attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. The fighting came to an end when US President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire.
Now, some Bollywood filmmakers see an opportunity to cash in on the battle.
India tagged its military action against Pakistan “Operation Sindoor”, the Hindi word for vermilion, which married Hindu women wear on their foreheads.
 
 

The name was seen as a symbol of Delhi’s determination to avenge those widowed in the April 22 attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which sparked the hostilities.
Film studios have registered a slew of titles evoking the operation, including: Mission Sindoor, Sindoor: The Revenge, The Pahalgam Terror and Sindoor Operation.

“It’s a story which needs to be told,” said director Vivek Agnihotri. “If it was Hollywood, they would have made 10 films on this subject. People want to know what happened behind the scenes,” he told AFP.
Coloured narratives
The ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party gave that film a glowing endorsement, despite accusations that it aimed to stir up hatred against India’s minority Muslims.
Since Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014, some critics say Bollywood is increasingly promoting his government’s ideology.
Raja Sen, a film critic and screenwriter, said filmmakers felt emboldened by an amenable government.
“We tried to wage a war and then we quietened down when Mr Trump asked us to. So what is the valour here?” Sen told AFP of the Pakistan clashes.

Anil Sharma, known for directing rabble-rousing movies, criticised the apparent rush to make films related to the Pahalgam attack.
“This is herd mentality … these are seasonal filmmakers, they have their constraints,” he said.
“I don’t wait for an incident to happen and then make a film based on that. A subject should evoke feelings and only then cinema happens,” said Sharma.
Sharma’s historical action flick Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001) and its sequel Gadar 2 (2023), both featuring Sunny Deol in lead roles, were big hits.
In Bollywood, filmmakers often seek to time releases for national holidays like Independence Day, which are associated with heightened patriotic fervour.
Fighter, featuring big stars Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, was released on the eve of India’s Republic Day on January 25 last year.
Anti-Muslim bias
Though not a factual retelling, it drew heavily from India’s 2019 airstrike on Pakistan’s Balakot. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews but raked in $28 million in India, making it the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of that year.
This year, Chhaava, a drama based on the life of Sambhaji Maharaj, a ruler of the Maratha Empire, became the highest-grossing film so far this year.
It also generated significant criticism for fuelling anti-Muslim bias.
“This is at a time when cinema is aggressively painting Muslim kings and leaders in violent light,” said Sen. “This is where those who are telling the stories need to be responsible about which stories they choose to tell.”
Sen said filmmakers were reluctant to choose topics that are “against the establishment”.
“If the public is flooded with dozens of films that are all trying to serve an agenda, without the other side allowed to make itself heard, then that propaganda and misinformation enters the public psyche,” he said.

Acclaimed director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra said true patriotism is promoting peace and harmony through the medium of cinema.
Mehra’s socio-political drama Rang De Basanti (2006) won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film and was chosen as India’s official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category.
“How can we arrive at peace and build a better society? How can we learn to love our neighbours?” he asked. “For me, that is patriotism.”</p><small>2025-08-03 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03191123bb7f192.jpg?r=202257' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928497/ex-ajk-pm-abdul-qayyum-niazi-arrested-in-bhimber-area-under-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-AJK PM Abdul Qayyum Niazi arrested in Bhimber area under MPO</strong></a><br><p>The former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, was arrested on Sunday over violations of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), a police official told Dawn.com.
Niazi in 2022 tendered his resignation from his office to defuse the move by his parliamentary party, the PTI, to replace him with regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas through a vote of no-confidence.
The MPO law in Pakistan allows authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to 90 days to prevent threats to public peace and safety.
Mirpur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Dr Liaqat Ali told Dawn.com that Niazi was arrested under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO.
“Under the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner, he was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” the DIG said.
“He is being held at the industrial area guest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail,” he said.
The Mirpur DIG added that plainclothes policemen from Islamabad came to detain the ex-PM under a first information report (FIR) — seen by Dawn.com — filed at the Karachi Company police station in the federal capital, but “we did not allow them to take him into custody”.
The FIR against Niazi in Islamabad was filed under the following sections:

109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment),
149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object)
186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions)
188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)
341 (punishment for wrongful restrain)
353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty)
395 (punishment for dacoity)
440 (mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt)
506 ii (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code

He was also booked under Sections 7 (punishment for terrorism) and 11X (responsibility for creating civil commotion) of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 8 (punishment) of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act.
DIG Dr Ali added that Niazi left Mirpur last night and headed to Bhimber to attend rallies.
Niazi’s nephew, Sardar Moteeb, said that the former PM was arrested when he was heading to Bhimber city from Samahni to attend a PTI rally related to the campaign demanding the release of party founder Imran Khan from prison.
“He was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” Moteeb said. “A team of plainclothes personnel had arrived from Islamabad to take his possessions, but local officials refused to hand them over to them and sent them back.”
Moteeb added that Niazi obtained bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.
Niazi’s press secretary, who was accompanying him at the time of the arrest, told Dawn.com that the former PM was arrested on the way to a rally and alleged that police “snatched” his mobile phone.
“Apart from Niazi, two other PTI office bearers from Kotli district, Malik Nisar and Dr Shahnawaz, were also taken into custody,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-03 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/031824158586539.jpg?r=182458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928495/latest-trump-tariffs-unlikely-to-budge-top-negotiator-says' target='_blank'><strong>Latest Trump tariffs unlikely to budge, top negotiator says</strong></a><br><p>The tariffs United States President Donald Trump imposed last week on scores of countries are likely to stay in place rather than be cut as part of continuing negotiations, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Sunday.
Ahead of a Friday deadline, Trump set rates including a 35 per cent duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.
In trade talks since Trump returned to office, the White House has lowered some rates from levels initially announced, including halving import duties set last week as part of a deal with the European Union.
 
 

Greer told CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, however, that this would not be the case on the most recent round of tariffs.
“A lot of these are set rates pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced, some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he said. “These tariff rates are pretty much set.”
Greer also said recent trade talks with Beijing had been “very positive” and were focused on the supply of rare earth magnets and minerals.
“We’re focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the- and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before … and I’d say we’re about halfway there.”

Hasina, 77, who has defied court orders to return from India to attend her trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity, is accused of ordering a deadly crackdown in a failed bid to crush the student-led uprising.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations.
The first witness, among the 11 cases that the prosecution is expected to present to the court, was Khokon Chandra Barman, whose story reflects the violence of the protests.
The 23-year-old wears a mask to conceal his face, which was ripped apart by a gunshot during the culmination of the protests on August 5, 2024, the same day that Hasina fled Dhaka by helicopter.
“I want justice for the ordeal I’ve been going through, and for my fellow protesters who sacrificed their lives,” he told the court.
Barman lost his left eye, while his right eye was damaged, as well as his lips, nose and teeth. A video showing Barman’s blood-covered face was played in court, with the opening statements aired on the state-run broadcaster.
 
 

Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina — including failure to prevent mass murder — which amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.
“Sheikh Hasina was the nucleus around whom all the crimes committed during the July-August uprising revolved,” chief prosecutor Tajul Islam told the court on Sunday.
Hasina is on trial in absentia alongside two other accused.
One, her former interior minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, is also a fugitive.
The other, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, the former inspector general of police, is in custody. He has pleaded guilty.
Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman said he wanted a “fair trial”, speaking to reporters outside the court.
“People were killed and maimed, we demand the highest punishment for the crimes committed,” Asaduzzaman said.
Amir Hossain, the state-appointed lawyer for Hasina, noted that Barman was shot during the chaotic final day of the weeks-long protests.
He pointed out that several police officers were also killed in clashes with protesters and it was “unclear who actually shot Barman”.
Hossain said he was not in contact with Hasina, who has refused to accept the authority of the court.</p><small>2025-08-03 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617129-ajk-ex-pm-sardar-abdul-qayyum-niazi-arrested-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>AJK ex-PM Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi arrested in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Political tensions bet­ween the two nations over the years have cast a sha­d­ow over bilateral sporting events, causing major tournaments to hang in the balance. The countries’ teams have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, electing to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead.
The Pakistani veterans team advanced into the WCL final on Wednesday after Indian players forfeited the semi-final scheduled for Thursday.
PCB issued a statement on Sunday announcing the blanket ban after chairman Mohsin Naqvi “reviewed with considerable disappointment WCL’s appalling conduct of awarding points to a willfully forfeiting team, and the content of the press releases of the WCL announcing the cancellation of the scheduled India vs Pakistan legends matches, which were tainted with hypocrisy and bias”.
WCL’s statement from July 30 said that while it has “always believed in the power of sport to inspire and bring about positive change in the world (…) public sentiment must always be respected — after all, everything we do is for our audience.
“We respect the India Champions’ decision to withdraw from the semi-finals, and we equally respect the Pakistan Champions’ readiness to compete,” the statement said.
 






PCB continued in its statement, saying the contents of WCL’s press release “highlight a duality where the narrative of ‘peace through sport’ is selectively applied and sporting events are held hostage to political expediency and narrow commercial interests”.
“The PCB has always advocated for the separation of sports and politics.
“Our unwavering belief is that cricket, like other international sports, should solely serve as a platform for goodwill, healthy competition, and mutual respect,” it said.
“For a tournament involving legendary players to be dictated by sentiments that undermine this fundamental principle is not only regrettable but also deeply concerning for the future of independent sporting events,” the national governing body continued.
“The WCL’s apology for ‘hurting the sentiments’, whilst being farcical, inadvertently acknowledges that the cancellation was not based on cricketing merit, but rather on succumbing to a specific nationalistic narrative.
“This bias, masquerading as sensitivity, sends an unacceptable message to the international sporting community,” PCB’s statement read.
“In light of this unfortunate development, which underscores a clear and intolerable pattern of external influence and a disregard for the principles of sporting neutrality, the Pakistan Cricket Board is compelled to take a firm stance.
“The PCB can no longer condone participation in an event where the fundamental principles of fair play and unbiased administration are compromised by external pressures,” it said.
The cricketing body added that it remains committed to promoting cricket globally and fostering healthy sporting rivalries.
“However, we cannot allow our players to be part of events where the spirit of the game is overshadowed by skewed politics that undermines the very essence of sportsmanship and the gentleman’s game.”
The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s website. The tournament commenced on July 18 and was held in Birmingham, England.</p><small>2025-08-03 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0315144479bbd37.jpg?r=151508' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928481/death-toll-from-monsoon-rains-climbs-to-299-including-140-children-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from monsoon rains climbs to 299, including 140 children: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>The nationwide death toll from monsoon rains has risen to 299, up from 234, as the season that began in late June continues to cause widespread devastation, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday, according to state-owned PTV News.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to earlier NDMA estimates, the death toll stood at 234, while 596 people have been injured since June 26.
According to the latest figures, “at least 299 people have lost their lives in this year’s flash floods and torrential rains, while another 715 people were reported injured. Out of the total death toll — 140 were children, 102 men and 57 women,” the report said.
Out of the 715 injured, 239 were children, 204 were women, while 272 were men, it added.
 
 

Detailing the damage to public property sustained during the rains and floods triggered by heavy rain, the report estimated that a total of 1676 houses were damaged, out of which 562 homes were destroyed completely.
Around 428 livestock were lost during the rains, the report said.
Since June 26, NDMA has rescued and evacuated 2,880 people from impacted regions, while relief efforts were also underway. Per the report, the authority distributed 13,466 relief items including 1,999 tents, 61 ration bags, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, 1,282 kitchen sets, 1,163 food packs, 350 life jackets, 1,122 Hygiene home kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps among other essential supplies.
On Saturday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasted more rain, with wind-thundershowers in the upper and central regions of the country over the coming week. PMD prompted provincial disaster management authorities and district administrations to take preventive measures against possible urban flooding.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expec­t­ed in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.</p><small>2025-08-03 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03133303fe14e6e.png?r=134820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472/cop-martyred-in-bannu-checkpoint-attack-as-retaliatory-fire-kills-3-militants' target='_blank'><strong>Cop martyred in Bannu checkpoint attack as retaliatory fire kills 3 militants</strong></a><br><p>Funeral prayers were held Sunday morning for a police constable martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in July.
Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said in a statement that three terrorists were killed and police constable Rooh Niaz Khan was martyred when 40 to 50 terrorists attacked the police check post in Fateh Khel, Bannu.
Three terrorists were killed and as many policemen were injured in the exchange of fire, which lasted more than an hour, the statement added.
Soon after receiving information about the attack on the post, RPO Khan and District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi, along with the force, left for the site of the incident, Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told Dawn.com.
“The terrorists had blocked the roads leading to the post, but the police officials reopened the roads and fought with the terrorists,” RPO Khan said.
“Police personnel bravely fought the terrorists, who used heavy weapons.”
He noted that the search operation for the miscreants was still underway.
According to a statement by the Bannu Police Office, funeral prayers for the martyred constable were offered on Sunday morning at Bannu Police Lines. In attendance were his relatives, RPO Khan, DPO Kulachi, and other police officers.
While speaking on the occassion, DPO Kulachi said: “Martyred police officer Rooh Niaz Khan sacrificed his life while fighting against anti-national elements, proving that Bannu Police is steadfast on every front.”
“We will never forget his sacrifice,” he said, adding that the bravery, sense of duty and sacrifice of the deceased are a beacon of light for everyone else.
DPO Kulachi emphasised that Bannu Police were fully capable of confronting terrorists on every front.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the martyred constable, saying he attained the highest level of martyrdom by sacrificing his life in line of duty.
“The police bravely fought the Indian-sponsored terrorists who attacked at night,” he said. Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of those injured.
On Thursday, at least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area, where KP police had foiled a terrorist attack bid earlier in the week.
However, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred last month when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.
Earlier in July, three terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation in Bannu, while another died in an encounter with police in Malakand district.</p><small>2025-08-03 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03144632047f474.jpg?r=144947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928480/india-wraps-up-mass-hindu-pilgrimage-in-held-kashmir-with-415000-attendees' target='_blank'><strong>India wraps up mass Hindu pilgrimage in held Kashmir with 415,000 attendees</strong></a><br><p>More than 400,000 Hindus took part in a month-long pilgrimage in Indian-held Kashmir, authorities said, shrugging off security worries weeks after a military conflict with Pakistan.
The pilgrimage began on July 3 and closes officially on August 9, but organisers said that lashing rains had damaged narrow paths, forcing a premature end.
Official Vijay Kumar Bidhuri said in a statement late on Saturday that 415,000 pilgrims had taken part.
Many of the faithful began their trek to the Amarnath ice pillar from near Pahalgam, where an April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists in the Muslim-majority region.
New Delhi, without evidence, said the gunmen were backed by Pakistan, claims Islamabad rejected — triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
It was the worst standoff by the nuclear-armed nations since 1999, with more than 70 people killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, before a May 10 ceasefire.
New Delhi last week claimed that three Pakistani men who carried out the Pahalgam attack were killed during a gun battle on July 28 in forests adjacent to the hills where the cave shrine is located.
A few devotees may still visit the cave, but the numbers this year fall short of the estimated half a million devotees who took part in 2024.
Officials appealed to Hindus to undertake the pilgrimage, ramping up security for the event by deploying 45,000 troops with high-tech surveillance tools overseeing the gruelling trek to the cave, dedicated to Shiva, the deity of
destruction.
On Sunday, Indian forces exchanged fire with gunmen for a third day in Kulgam, far from the Amarnath pilgrimage route.
Soldiers have killed two fighters, a senior police officer said.</p><small>2025-08-03 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03143532aba42ea.jpg?r=143600' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928478/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-for-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts' target='_blank'><strong>Russia cancels tsunami warning for Kamchatka after quake, dormant volcano erupts</strong></a><br><p>Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services lifted a tsunami warning for the Kamchatka Peninsula on Sunday after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands.
The ministry had said earlier on the Telegram messaging app that expected wave heights were low, but warned people to move away from the shore.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning System, which gauged the quake at 7.0, said, however, there was no tsunami warning after the quake. The US Geological Survey also said the earthquake was at a magnitude of 7.
Overnight, the Krasheninnikov Volcano in Kamchatka erupted for the first time in 600 years, Russia’s RIA state news agency and scientists reported on Sunday.
Both incidents could be connected to the huge earthquake that rocked Russia’s Far East last week, which triggered tsunami warnings as far away as French Polynesia and Chile, and was followed by an eruption of Klyuchevskoy, the most active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula.
The Kuril Islands stretch from the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russian scientists had warned on Wednesday that strong aftershocks were possible in the region in the next several weeks.
“This is the first historically confirmed eruption of Krasheninnikov Volcano in 600 years,” RIA cited Olga Girina, head of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, as saying.
On the Telegram channel of the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, Girina said that Krasheninnikov’s last lava effusion took place within 40 years of 1463, and no eruption has been known since.
The Kamchatka branch of Russia’s ministry for emergency services said that an ash plume rising up to 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) has been recorded following the volcano’s eruption. The volcano itself stands at 1,856 metres.
“The ash cloud has drifted eastward, toward the Pacific Ocean. There are no populated areas along its path,” the ministry said on Telegram.
The eruption of the volcano has been assigned an orange aviation code, indicating a heightened risk to aircraft, the ministry said.</p><small>2025-08-03 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617095-pti-all-set-for-peaceful-august-5-protest-movement-asad-qaiser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI all set for ‘peaceful' August 5 protest movement: Asad Qaiser</strong></a><br><p>

On the same night he took four wickets to reach a West Indies T20I record 81 for his career — breaking Dwayne Bravo’s old mark of 78 — Holder went 16 not out and West Indies ended a horrid losing streak with zero balls to spare.
Pakistan, which won Thursday’s opener by 14 runs, will try to bounce back in Sunday’s series-deciding T20 match under the lights at Lauderhill, Florida.
 






West Indies, set 134 to win, was on the brink of a seventh consecutive T20 defeat after having been swept 5-0 last month by visiting Australia.
Gudakesh Motie led West Indies with 28 runs but went down on the first ball of the 17th over, run out by Mohammed Haris with the hosts on 96 for six.
Haris caught Keacy Carty for a duck three balls later but Holder swatted a six to end the 18th over, West Indies still needing 24 to win.
Romario Shepherd smashed a six and a four off Hasan Ali in the 19th over to leave West Indies on 126 for seven entering the final over.
Shaheen Shah Afridi allowed Holder a run but then took Shepherd’s wicket lbw for 15. He allowed newcomer Shamar Joseph a run that pulled West Indies within six runs with three balls remaining.

An Edhi spokesperson added that when their lifeguards resumed the search operation on Saturday morning, they found the body of Aurangzeb Alam floating at sea near China Port.  
The bodies of the two minor children — Ahmed and Ayat — were found at Seaview on Friday morning.  
The man with his minor son and daughter had jumped into the sea near a waterfront high-rise building.  
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the children’s maternal uncle Rameez Husain in a written statement told the police that his brother-in-law Alam and his sister along with their children had appeared before a court on July 31 over a petition (No 3290/2024) for custody of the children. He claimed that the custody issue was ‘amicably’ settled between the couple.  
Later, Alam, along with his wife and children, went to the food street at Burns Road for a lunch. Subsequently, he left the restaurant, saying he needed to go to the toilet. He took his children with him and did not return.  
Mr Rameez said they had immediately informed the Madadgar-15 about that and also submitted an application before the Aram Bagh police to this effect.

Jatoi was talking to journalists outside the court of the first additional sessions judge Larkana on Saturday where he appeared in connection with a case, accusing him of obstructing official duty. The court adjourned the hearing to Aug 18.
He said the case was registered at Badah police station. It was initially heard in Dokri court and was then transferred to the district and sessions court from where it was subsequently assigned to the first additional sessions judge Larkana. 
He said the hearing did not proceed and was put off to Aug 18. “God willing, truth will prevail, and falsehood will be exposed,” he said.
He said that a similar case was registered in Ranipur but later his and his colleagues’ names were struck off the case, and they were acquitted. “I believe these false cases will not hold up. God willing, all the cases will gradually come to an end,” he added. 

Says there’s huge difference between PPP of Benazir Bhutto and today’s ruling party in Sindh

He said that instead of registering false and concocted cases against political opponents, the Sindh government should focus on law and order. “I believe the law and order situation can improve but police are being used to suppress political opponents. The situation has led to unrest in Sindh, he said.
He said: “If you enter Sindh from Punjab, you will clearly feel difference in development. Here, all attention is focused on minting money and eliminating political opponents,” he alleged. 
Jatoi said that there was a huge difference between the PPP of Benazir Bhutto and the current party. Now the PPP had been taken over by thieves, mafias and looters, who were exploiting the people of Sindh, he said.
“The true heir of Bhutto is Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Junior and we will welcome him to politics,” Mr Jatoi said, adding that he had twice met him. The entire opposition in Sindh should unite and work collectively to rid the province of this mafia as no single party could do it alone, he said. 
He advised Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr. to form his own party and join hands with the entire opposition to launch a joint struggle for a clean, honest, and corruption-free leadership in Sindh.

PTI Islamabad chapter head Aamir Mughal said that, under the “guerrilla struggle,” they would block various main roads and share the message of Imran Khan.
“However, workers will disperse before the arrival of police. Our goal is to record the protest and protect our workers from arrest and police torture. We know that torture is the only weapon of the ruling elite,” Mr Mughal said.
 






He vowed to expand this new strategy from Islamabad to the rest of the country.
It is worth mentioning that PTI has called for a protest on August 5, the day marking two years of Imran Khan’s incarceration. Imran Khan will lead the protest from jail.
Earlier this week, PTI submitted a request to the capital administration to hold a workers’ convention (jalsa) at F-9 Park on August 5.
A written application was submitted by the PTI Islamabad chapter to the office of the deputy commissioner.
The application, signed by PTI Islamabad Region President Aamir Masood Mughal and General Secretary Malik Amir Ali, stated that “On behalf of PTI Islamabad Region, we are writing this letter to seek your kind permission to organise a peaceful workers’ convention (jalsa) at Fatima Jinnah Park (F-9 Park), Islamabad on Tuesday, August 5, 2025, from 4pm to 10pm.”
The gathering, it added, was part of the party’s ongoing political activities to mobilise and engage its workers. “It will be a peaceful event aimed at energising and uniting the workers across Islamabad,” it stated.
“We assure you that all arrangements will be made in a disciplined manner, and full cooperation will be extended to the district administration and law enforcement agencies. Kindly provide us the necessary permission to use the venue and deploy security personnel to ensure the safety of all participants,” the application stated.
All SOPs, including public safety and park usage regulations, will be strictly followed. We hope for your kind cooperation and timely approval of our request, it added.

The interior ministry on Thursday issued a special regulatory order (SRO), saying PoR cards expired on June 30 this year, rendering their holders’ stay in the country unlawful. It empowered district administration, police, prosecution, prisons and all other authorities to take appropriate measures for the arrest and detention, whether in jails or other suitable premises, and repatriation of all such illegal foreigners.
“Federal Government is pleased to invoke the provisions of sub-sections (I), (2)(c), (2)(e)(i) and (2)(g) of Section 3 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, in relation to PoR card holders forthwith,” the SRO read.
Following the issuance of SRO, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa home and tribal affairs department on Friday made a public announcement regarding the deportation of Afghans with PoR cards. It was also published in Saturday’s newspapers.

UNHCR says govt’s decision raises serious concerns about refugees protection, legal status

In the announcement, the department said since PoR cards had expired on June 30, their holders were unlawfully staying in the country.
It added that the government had already implemented the decision of deportation of undocumented Afghans as well as holders of Afghan Citizen Card (AAC).
“Stay of all those Afghan nationals without having Pakistani visa on valid passport is unlawful, therefore, they should leave for homeland,” it said.
The department also said that the KP government had set up transit points at Peshawar and Landikotal area of Khyber tribal district to host the returning Afghans.
Though PoR cards’ validity expired on June 30 this year, its holders hoped that authorities would extend their stay, like they always used to do.
At least three notifications were issued by the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions in June and July this year, directing police and other authorities to not arrest those with PoR cards, block their accounts and phone SIM cards, further giving them hopes about possible extension of their stay in the country.
Chairperson of the Muttahida Afghan Tajir Ittehad Syed Naqeeb Badshah told Dawn that the “sudden decision to expel Afghans” was an unwise decision.
He said that just weeks ago, the Safron ministry had conveyed to government departments that the case for extension of PoR holders’ stay was being submitted to the federal cabinet.
Mr Badshah said that it was cruel to order millions of people to leave immediately, who were staying here for decades.
“I am not sure if Afghan refugees fall victim to politics or something else happened,” he said.
The chairperson said that there were around 40,000 Afghans businessmen in Peshawar, who had invested from Rs1 million to Rs1 billion in Pakistan.
“Pakistani government wakes up one fine day and asks these people, including 559 having invested over Rs1 billion in the country, to leave immediately. This makes no sense,” he said.
Mr Badshah said that Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was due in Islamabad the next week to hold talks with Pakistani authorities, UNHCR, IOM and refugee leaders.
“This decision is unilateral and we have repeatedly asked the Pakistani leaders to review it,” he said.
An Afghan leather garment designer told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the notification had spread fear and panic among Afghans living in Pakistan.
“Every Afghan is fear-stricken and even there is no forum left where we could petition,” he said.
He said that they were businessmen and not refugees.
“At least 22 workers are working with me and fear-mongering about refugees as a burden was unfounded,” he said.
Spokesman for UNHCR Pakistan Qaiser Khan Afridi voiced “deep concern about the latest worrying developments” regarding the implementation of Islamabad’s plan to repatriate registered refugees with PoR cards.
“We have seen the recent notification [SRO] that was issued by the Ministry of Interior on July 31 regarding the launch of phase III of the Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan and are following up with the relevant authorities to clarify the implications for registered refugees,” he said.
He said that the SRO, which rendered PoR card holders present in the country unlawful, raised serious concerns about their protection and legal status, not to mention severe disruption to incomes and education.
“The refugee legal character of people affected by the threat of deportation remains, and forced returns could breach the principle of non-refoulement, where states are bound not to return people back to countries where their life or freedom could be threatened,” he said.
Mr Afridi added that UNHCR advocated for the protection of all refugees and that any return should be conducted in a voluntary, safe and dignified manner, in line with international principles.
According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.
Following a nationwide census of Afghans in 2004-05, the Pakistani government with the help of UNHCR issued a Proof of Registration (PoR) card to Afghan refugees whereas in 2016, through an amendment in the Foreigner Act 1946, Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC) was introduced.
Since November 2023 when Pakistani authorities started implementing the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, undocumented as well as AAC Card holders have left the country, while Afghans with PoR cards are the only category of those still legally staying in Pakistan.
The July 1-15 figures from the report on the IOM biweekly flow monitoring of Afghan nationals show that a total of 1.14 million individuals have returned to Afghanistan since Sept 2023. According to them, the highest number of 262,443 individuals returned to Afghanistan in November 2023, while 148,121 others went back in April this year, following a government drive to deport ACC Card holders.
The IOM report stated that during the reporting period (1 - 15 July 2025), fear of arrest (93pc) remained an important reason for respondents to return. “Additionally, 29 per cent reported that they returned because a family member was deported,” it said.

The second round of talks between Bajaur Aman (peace) Jirga members and local terrorist leaders aimed at convincing them to leave the region ended on Saturday, said the sources.
They told Dawn that talks between the 50-member peace jirga and terrorist leaders were held in the Lowi Mamund tehsil.
The terrorists had requested a day’s time at the Friday meeting to consult their leadership over the jirga’s two-point demands — either to return to Afghanistan or retreat to the mountains if they wanted to fight the security forces, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals.
However, the sources said that no significant development took place in this crucial meeting, meant to convince the terrorist to leave the region peacefully.
The details of the meeting, which started at around 3pm and ended late on Saturday evening, have yet to be formally disclosed by the jirga’s head, to the media.
The sources said that the terrorist leaders also assured the jirga members that they would remain peaceful in the region.
According to the sources, head of the Bajaur Aman Jirga Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, who along with several members met with high-ups to inform them about the meeting’s developments, was satisfied that people would hear positive news soon.
However, Mr Rashid didn’t inform the media about the meeting’s developments till the filing of this report at 9:20pm, ‘as they were still in a meeting’.
Meanwhile, several humanitarian organisations have established relief camps in anticipation of displacement of residents from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil amid an anti-terrorist operation, sources said on Saturday.
They told Dawn that the relief camps were mostly set up by local non-governmental organisations in different safe areas of Lowi Mamund and Khar tehsils.
The sources said Al-Khidmat Foundation, JUI-F, and the Pakistan Red Crescent Society were among the organisations that had set up relief camps to facilitate those displaced from the operation-affected areas of Lowi Mamund.
They added that some well-off individuals in the district had also set up relief camps, providing food and essential commodities.

The new tariff, added on top of existing duties, is seen as significantly higher than expected, undermining hopes for improved trade relations and market share, particularly in comparison to regional competitors such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
Industry leaders argue that the new tariff structure, combined with rising domestic production costs, makes it increasingly difficult to compete. One exporter noted that the higher tariffs, along with Pakistan’s growing production costs, could result in a decline in export volumes. “The deal is neutral at best,” the exporter said, pointing out that regional players like Vietnam and Bangladesh, with their lower production costs, remain better positioned.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani told Dawn that Pakistan’s primary competitors in the US market, Bangladesh and Vietnam, stand to benefit from the existing tariff structure due to their significantly lower production costs.

Textile sector struggles as tariff hike limits market gains

Mr Bilwani estimated that Pakistan’s production costs are 10-20pc higher, putting local exporters at a distinct disadvantage. He further criticised the government’s failure to support exporters effectively, pointing to the recent proposal of new taxes on cotton yarn and fabric imports — critical materials for producing export-grade goods. He stressed that imported yarn offers superior quality, which is vital for maintaining competitiveness in global markets.
 
 

On April 2, the US imposed a 29pc reciprocal tariff on Pakistani exports, an additional duty on top of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rate. This was followed by a 90-day pause, which set a provisional baseline tariff of 10pc (MFN + 10pc) until July 9, later extended to August 1.
After a series of “comprehensive and discreet negotiations,” the revised tariff of 19pc was finalised. While the government has hailed this as a success, some industry representatives, including M. Hassan Shafqaat, CEO of the Pakistan Textile Council, expressed disappointment. “We were expecting a lower reciprocal tariff, in the range of 10-15pc, based on positive signals from government officials,” he said, adding that the new tariff is equivalent to what was imposed on Pakistan’s competitors without them offering anything in return to the US.
Sources revealed that Pakistan had proposed to reduce the $2.9bn trade deficit by importing US cotton worth $1bn, oil-related products worth $1.2bn, and other US goods such as soybeans. The country also offered to remove non-tariff barriers, as recommended in the US Trade Representative’s report.
Mr Shafqaat explained that Pakistan’s competitors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, now face tariffs between 19-20pc under the MFN+ regime. Only India, with a reciprocal tariff of 25pc, faces a higher tariff than Pakistan.
However, he noted that India’s favourable economic conditions — lower business costs and significant fiscal space — allow the government to cushion exporters with subsidies, rebates, and interest-free financing. As a result, he said, the 6pc tariff differential may not significantly affect India’s competitiveness in the apparel sector. Shafqaat suggested that some US-based buyers of home textiles might consider shifting to Pakistan if the tariff on India does not reduce in the near future.
Textile exporters also expressed concerns about potential conditions attached to the tariff, particularly the rules of origin for Pakistan. US President Trump’s letters specifically mention that transshipped goods will be subject to higher duties, raising the possibility of tariff adjustments for countries like Pakistan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. “It remains unclear whether countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which were subjected to tariffs without formal agreements, will be exempt from rules of origin requirements,” Shafqaat noted, adding that further changes to reciprocal tariffs cannot be ruled out.
China is expected to redirect its unsold textile products — originally intended for the US market — to the EU and UK, with India likely to follow suit. As a result, Pakistan could face intensified competition from both China and India in these alternative markets.
Khurram Mukhtar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, welcomed the US tariff reduction but stressed that the government must take urgent action to make the textile sector more competitive. “Reforms in taxation, energy tariffs, improved refund mechanisms, and better access to credit are critical for sustaining growth in the sector,” he said. While he noted that overall US demand might decline as consumers bear the cost of higher tariffs, he warned that Pakistan’s exporters cannot afford complacency. “There is no room for complacency. Reforms are more urgent than ever,” he added.

The first incident occurred on Saturday morning in the Langerkhel Surband area, where children playing in the fields discovered an unexploded mortar shell and brought it back to their village.
The device detonated as they played near a rainwater tank, killing five children aged between eight and 12, and injuring 13 others, including two women.
 
 

“The explosion left five children dead and 13 others, including two women, injured,” police said.

15 people, including four women, injured

The deceased were identified as Zenat Bibi, daughter of Jhang Khan; Shaila Bibi, daughter of Naimatullah; Muzammil, son of Naimatullah; Rafiullah, son of Fatehullah; and Palwasha, daughter of Bankhan; all residents of Wanda Langerkhel Surband.
The injured included Luqman, Bilal, Shadan, Latifa Bibi, Mohsin, Fawad, Jamshed, Wajeeh, Riffat, Mumtaz Bibi (wife of Bankhan), Fatima Bibi (wife of Sattar), Ahmad, and Saqib, according to the police.
ASI Zafar Mehmood, the official in charge of Lakki City police post, said he with his team was on patrol duty when they learned of the incident and immediately reached the hospital.
Separately, a villager was killed and two women injured in a quadcopter strike in the Shaikh Khula area.
Police said Azizullah, 54, died instantly when an explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated at his home. His wife, Shaikhzad Bibi, 50, and daughter-in-law, Raj Bibi, 22, were injured in the blast. The police quoted Saadullah as saying that the explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated, resulting in the death of his father Azizullah.
The injured were taken to hospital by the villagers. Police have registered case under relevant sections of law in the city police station and launched investigation.

In a statement on Saturday, PTI CIS lashed out at the government for labelling the PTI founder’s sons as foreigners. He made it clear that they were Pakistani nationals who possessed National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOPs), and therefore have every legal and constitutional right to visit Pakistan and see their father.
 
 

“The oppressive and tyrannical government was forced to lie out of fear of Imran Khan’s children coming to Pakistan, which shows how weak and cowardly they are,” Mr Waqas stated.
He emphasised that both were issued tracking numbers for their visa applications submitted to the Pakistan High Commission in London — with Sulaiman’s tracking ID being 88005575178 and Kasim’s 88005575782.

Asserts both are Pakistanis, shares details of visa, NICOP applications

He said applications for both visas and NICOPs have been submitted, and while the issuance of NICOPs may take several weeks from Pakistan, visas can be granted within a matter of hours.
The high commissioner intimated a friend of Mr Khan’s family, who spoke to him that he needed clearance from the Ministry of Interior, the PTI leader claimed.
He said the boys were contacting the embassy through normal routes, and there was no response.
The interior ministry in an official statement claimed it had nothing to do with visa issuance. Then the government claimed, “visa applications have not been received”, he remarked.
The party leader also formally released details about NICOP status of Kasim and Sulaiman as issued by the government.

• Below average inflows in Jhelum mean water in reservoir increases only a few inches each day
LAHORE: Despite record rainfall and flooding in rivers, experts have warned of a 25 per cent water shortage in a few months due to a significant decline in Jehlum River’s inflows.
The drop in inflows has also slowed the filling of the Mangla Dam, one of the country’s two biggest reservoirs.
Inflows in the Jhelum River on Saturday dropped to 25,200 cusecs, 47 per cent less than its recorded average. On the corresponding day last year, the inflows were 39,700 cusecs.
The last five-year average for the day was 47,900 cusecs and 44,200 cusecs for the last 10 years.
Due to lesser inflows, water in the Mangla dam was only increasing a few inches each day. According to water experts, this could result in a 25pc water shortage in the coming Rabi season.
From Thursday to Friday, the dam’s storage only increased from 1,200.65 feet to 1,201.20 feet, 41ft below the total capacity of 1,242 feet.
Currently, the dam is holding 4.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its total live capacity of 7.3MAF.
The loss of 3MAF water would translate into up to 12 to 15 per cent water shortages in the coming Rabi season.
Adding the permanent water loss of eight to 10pc due to the reduced capacity of the Tarbela Dam — as a result of silt accumulation — the country is expected to suffer 20 to 25pc water loss during the next Rabi season, according to experts.
According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) data, all but one river yielded less water than they did last year.
The data from April 1 to July 31 showed the Indus River produced 37.20MAF water, which is 31pc higher than its 10-year average and 36pc more than last year.
During the same period, the Kabul River yielded 8.2MAF water, 36pc less than its 10-year average and 53pc less than last year.
The Chenab River nearly maintained its average yield with 10.70MAF water, still 6pc less than the 10-year average but 3pc more than last year.
In total, the Jehlum river produced 8.7MAF water in the last four months. It was 27pc less than the last year and 28pc less than the 10-year average.
Tensions between India and Pakistan since early May have also affected water inflows in the Mangla Dam.
India has stopped sharing river inflows data since April when it unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty.
Irsa Spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana has said almost half a million acre feet of water had to be released from Mangla Dam to cover for the uncertainty created by India’s decision.
“On May 5, inflows in the Chenab river dropped from 35,000 cusecs to mere 5,000 within 24 hours.
Similarly, on May 31, it dipped from 45,000 to a paltry 7,000 cusecs,“ Mr Rana added.
Earlier, on April 5, inflows dropped from  10,000 to 4,000 cusecs.
To cover for these inconsistencies and ensure smooth irrigation of crops, Irsa released additional water from the Mangla Dam, Mr Rana said, adding these factors apparently slowed the reservoir’s filling.
“Normally, we get two to three late showers every monsoon, which helps Mangla dam filling,” he said, adding the downpour didn’t happen this year and there was no forecast for one in the near future.

• Pakistani officials say electronic assault on Indian communications systems reduced situational awareness
ISLAMABAD: India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India in May, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.
India’s defence and foreign ministries did not return requests for comment about the intelligence mistakes. Delhi hasn’t acknowledged a Rafale being shot down, but France’s air chief told reporters in June that he had seen evidence of the loss of that fighter and two other aircraft flown by India, including a Russian-made Sukhoi. A top Dassault executive also told French lawmakers that month that India had lost a Rafale in operations, though he didn’t have specific details.
Account of aerial battle
Reuters spoke to eight Pakistani and two Indian officials to piece together an account of the aerial battle, which marked the start of four days of fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours that caused alarm in Washington. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.
Not only did Islamabad have the element of surprise with its missiles’ range, the Pakistani and Indian officials said, but it managed to more efficiently connect its military hardware to surveillance on the ground and in the air, providing it with a clearer picture of the battlefield. Such networks, known as “kill chains,” have become a crucial element of modern warfare.
Four Pakistani officials said they created a “kill chain,” or a multi-domain operation, by linking air, land and space sensors. The network included a Pakistani-developed system, Data Link 17, which connected Chinese military hardware with other equipment, including a Swedish-made surveillance plane, two Pakistani officials said.
The system allowed the J-10s flying closer to India to obtain radar feeds from the surveillance plane cruising further away, meaning the Chinese-made fighters could turn their radars off and fly undetected, according to experts. Pakistan’s military did not respond to requests for comment on this point.
Delhi is trying to set up a similar network, the Indian officials said, adding that their process was more complicated because the country sourced aircraft from a wide range of exporters.
Retired UK air marsahl Greg Bagwell, now a fellow at RUSI, said the episode didnt conclusively prove the superiority of either Chinese or Western air assets but it showed the importance of having the right information and using it.
The winner in this was the side that had the best situational awareness, said Mr Bagwell.
Change in tactics
After India in the early hours of May 7 struck targets in Pakistan that it called terrorist infrastructure, the PAF chief ordered his squadrons to switch from defence to attack.
Five PAF officials said India had deployed some 70 planes, which was more than they had expected and provided Islamabad’s PL-15s with a target-rich environment. India has not said how many planes were used.
Five Pakistani officials said an electronic assault on Indian sensors and communications systems reduced the situational awareness of the Rafale’s pilots.
The two Indian officials said the Rafales were not blinded during the skirmishes and that Indian satellites were not jammed. But they acknowledged that Pakistan appeared to have disrupted the Sukhoi, whose systems Delhi is now upgrading.
In the aftermath of the episode, India’s deputy army chief Lt. Gen. Rahul Singh accused Pakistan of receiving live inputs from China during the battles, implying radar and satellite feeds.
He did not provide evidence and Islamabad denies the allegation.
Beijing’s air chief Lt Gen Wang Gang, however, visited Pakistan in July to discuss how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put together the “kill chain for the Rafale, two PAF officials said.
The Pakistani military said in a statement in July that Wang had expressed “keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in Multi Domain Operations.”
The hour-long fight, which took place in darkness, involved some 110 aircraft, experts estimate, making it the world’s largest air battle in decades. The J-10 jets shot down at least one Rafale, Reuters reported in May, citing the US officials.
Its downing surprised many in the military community and raised questions about the effectiveness of Western military hardware against untested Chinese alternatives. Shares of Dassault, which makes the Rafale, dipped after reports that the fighter had been shot down.

The “Jubilee of Youth” — when the Vatican invites Catholics aged 18 to 35 to the seat of the global Church’s power — has seen young pilgrims from around the world flood Rome, waving flags, singing or praying in groups. 
It comes nearly three months after Leo, 69, the first American pontiff, began his papacy, and 25 years after the last such massive youth gathering in Rome under Pope John Paul II of Poland. 
On Saturday morning, thousands of young pilgrims had already gathered at the vast open space in Rome’s eastern Tor Vergata neighbourhood where the pope will lead the vigil, the ground already dotted with blankets and mattresses. Elsewhere in the “eternal city”, numerous groups of young people were seen preparing to set off for the venue. 
On the plaza outside the Basilica of St John Lateran, they filled water bottles, applied suncream and checked bags of food and snacks — ready to spend the next 24 hours surrounded by a swarm of people and then sleep under the stars. 
Victoria Perez, who carried a Spanish flag, could not contain her excitement at seeing “the Pope up close. “It’s the first time I’m going to see him, and I can’t wait,” the 21-year-old said, excited to experience the “night of prayers under the stars”. 
French pilgrim, Quentin Remaury, 26, said he had been inspired by the late Pope Francis’s rousing message to youth during a 2016 visit to Krakow, Poland. “Pope Francis told us to `get off your couches’, and that really gave me a boost,” he said.
`What is his message?’
Since the youth jubilee began on Monday, attendees have participated in various Church-planned events throughout the city. 
On Friday, approximately 1,000 priests were on hand to take confession at Circus Maximus, one of Rome’s top tourist spots. 
Some 200 white gazebos lined the hippodrome where chariot races were once held and youths lined up to speak to priests in 10 different languages. 
Of the many languages heard on the streets of the Italian capital this week, Spanish seemed to dominate. The Vatican has said that more than 146 countries were represented and it expects up to a million people to attend the vigil. 
The pilgrimage is taking place as economic uncertainty and anxiety over climate change rises among the under-30s, with many saying they were curious to hear the Church’s position on global warming, wars and economic inequalities. 
Samarei Semos, 29, said she had travelled three days from her native Belize to get to Rome. 
“We are still trying to understand his leadership,” she said of the new pope, adding she hoped he would have a strong say about “third world countries”. 
As Parisian student Alice Berry exclaimed: “What does he have to say to us? What is his message for young people?”
