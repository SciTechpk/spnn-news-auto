• Unicef warns of drought conditions developing in the besieged enclave
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said 31 Pales­tinian aid seekers were among at least 60 people killed Friday by Israeli forces, the latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that five people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 26 others near a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli-controlled strip of land that bisects the Palestinian territory.
Thousands of Palestinians have gathered there daily in the hope of receiving food rations, as famine looms across Gaza after more than 20 months of war.
The Israeli army said that its troops in the Netzarim area had first fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them.
 


When the individuals continued advancing, “an aircraft struck and eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,” the army said.
Similar incidents have occurred in that area regularly since late May, when the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation opened its distribution centres, as Israel eased a two-month aid blockade.
The privately run foundation’s operations in Gaza have been marred by chaotic scenes. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with it over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
Elsewhere in the territory on Friday, Bassal said 14 people were killed in two separate strikes in and around the central city of Deir el-Balah, and 13 others in three Israeli air strikes in the Gaza City area.
One of those strikes, which killed three people, hit a phone charging station in the city, Bassal said.
In southern Gaza, two people were killed “by Israeli gunfire” in two separate incidents, he added.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
‘Israel using hunger as a weapon’
In a statement on Friday, the Hamas group, which says Israel is using hunger as a weapon against the population of Gaza, accused Israel of systematically targeting Palestinians seeking food aid across the enclave.
Meanwhile, Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, warned in Geneva of drought conditions developing in Gaza.
“Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40pc of drinking water production facilities remain functional,” Unicef spokesperson James Elder told reporters. “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water…”
Unicef also reported a 50pc increase in children aged six months to five years admitted for treatment of malnutrition from April to May in Gaza, and half a million people going hungry.
Elder, who was recently in Gaza, said he had many testimonials of women and children injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.
A lack of public clarity on when the sites — some of which are in combat zones — are open is causing mass casualty events, he added.
Al-Quds Brigades said on Friday it had targeted an Israeli military post in the southern city of Khan Yunis, claiming “dead and wounded” Israeli troops as a result. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military did not comment.
Much of Khan Yunis, like vast areas across Gaza, is under Israeli military evacuation orders.

• PPP lawmaker calls for creation of South Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: Like every year, the National Assembly on Friday once again echoed with the familiar demand for creating new provinces in the country during the general debate on the federal budget.
Taking part in the debate on the budget for the next fiscal year, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf forcefully demanded carving out Hazara province in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whereas PPP’s Syed Murtaza Mahmud called for bifurcating Punjab to create South Punjab province.
“I demand that wherever it is administratively viable, new provinces should be created in the country. Hazara province as well as other provinces should be made to resolve the public issues and to meet people’s needs,” declared the minister who belongs to the ruling PML-N.
He accused the provincial PTI government of neglecting Hazara region in general and Mansehra in particular, alleging that the people of the area were being deprived of their fundamental rights. He said Mansehra had a population of more than 300,000 people who do not even have access to clean drinking water.
“The PTI’s provincial government is least interested in provision of basic facilities to the people of Mansehra,” he went on saying, while stressing the need for creating Hazara provinces.
Drawing attention of the house towards the ongoing movement for the Hazara province in KP, he said the only solution to the country’s problems was the creation of new provinces.
He further said the main purpose of the parliament was to discuss the problems of the people and suggest their solutions.
Similarly, participating in the budget debate, PPP MNA from Rahim Yar Khan Murtaza Mahmud urged all the political parties to sit together to discuss formation of South Punjab province in order to remove the sense of deprivation among the people of the region.
 
 

Mr Mehmud said that presently Punjab comprised 60 per cent of Pakistan because of which “anti-Punjab slogan has become popular in smaller provinces”. He was of the view that South Punjab province was necessary for Pakistan.
On June 17, PPP’s Abdul Qadir Gilani had also decried the Punjab government’s discriminatory policy towards south Punjab, stating that sense of deprivation was increasing among the people in the region.
He had regretted that only three development schemes had been announced for the region whereas some 40 plans had been announced for Lahore and central Punjab.
“I don’t know when will we get rid of Takht-i-Lahore [Lahore Kingdom]? But we will continue our struggle,” said Mr Gilani, who is the son of Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, in an apparent reference to the demand for a separate South Punjab province.
He praised the previous PTI government for setting up South Punjab Secretariat in Bahawalpur, urging the government to make it functional.
Meanwhile, taking part in the budget debate, PTI’s Junaid Akbar Chaudhry, who is also the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), criticised the government’s economic policies.
In an apparent reference to the party’s stance that the previous elections were heavily rigged, the PTI leader said the treasury benchers knew that those who counted votes were more important than those who polled the votes, adding that “they also know that those who have brought them into power, can bring them into power again.”
Mr Chaudhry claimed that the courts had become redundant as they had been unable to deliver justice after the 26th Constitutional Amendment and went on suggesting conversion of courts’ buildings into universities.
Arrest powers
Earlier in the day, Minister of State for Finance and head of the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit Bilal Azhar Kayani addressed the National Assembly, in which he responded to the criticism on the government’s move to empower tax officials to make arrests at the inquiry stage in sales tax cases.
The minister said that for the first time in the parliamentary history, the budget had been minutely discussed in the NA Standing Committee on Finance. He said the finance minister and the officials of the ministry regularly attended meetings of the committees of both the houses of the parliament.
Mr Kayani claimed that economic stability had been achieved while fulfilling IMF conditions and simultaneously providing public relief. He said the National Tariff Policy would be a cornerstone of PM Shehbaz Sharif’s vision to boost exports and drive economic growth.
He expressed the hope that the current IMF programme would be Pakistan’s last one, once the economy achieved sustainable growth and became self-reliant through dollar-earning exports.
The National Assembly will now meet on Monday morning.

• Bench ‘realised pressure endured by PTI members’, rectified situation, argues Salman Akram Raja
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s order in the reserved seats case amended the Constitution as it altered the constitutional deadline of three days for independent lawmakers to join a political party, Justice Musarrat Hilali has remarked.
The court’s order on July 12, 2024 — more than five months after the general elections on Feb 8 — allowed 41 PTI-backed independent lawmakers to confirm their political affiliation in 15 days.
Justice Hilali made these remarks on Friday while hearing appeals filed against last year’s order.
She also asked Salman Akram Raja, who was representing PTI lawmaker Kanwal Shauzab, to comment on this constitutional amendment.
Mr Raja disapproved of the impression, saying the situation under which PTI contested last year’s elections was “something where the party had to swim through a river of fire and blood”.
The counsel explained the July 12 verdict did not extend the time period to 15 days from the statutory three days. Rather, it stated that these 41 out of 80 candidates should be considered to have been backed by PTI from the very beginning.
The verdict realised the “pressures endured by PTI members” and the court decided the only way to rectify the situation was to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 66 of the Elections Rules, the counsel explained.
Through the judgement, 41 members were asked to notify through affidavits to which party they belonged within 15 days. However, the candidates were never asked to join PTI, the counsel argued.
The entire electoral process, Mr Raja emphasised, was a fundamental right exercised through articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, another bench member, asked Mr Raja whether PTI was claiming entitlement to reserved seats in parliament.
 
 

“Do you think it is the right of any political party to claim reserved seats?” asked Justice Najafi.
The counsel retorted it was the right of the people to ensure that reserved seats were allocated as per the proportionate representation system.
The Constitution mandated parliament to be filled with representatives chosen by the people of Pakistan, the counsel contended.
“If elections were not fair, then why has the Supreme Court not struck them down?” questioned Justice Najafi.
The counsel said it could have been done so but the Supreme Court exercised restraint.
On constitutional deviations, Mr Raja said, it was for the first time in history a — major — political party was de-legitimised by not allowing it to contest the election.
Therefore, the majority of judges in the July 12 judgment recognised that constitutional deviation was committed on account of effective de-recognition of PTI as a political party, which resulted in certain consequences.
Mr Raja defended PTI members, saying that to blame them for committing mistakes by identifying themselves as independent candidates and then deliberately joining the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) gives and impression that everything else was alright.
 
 

He added that 11 out of 13 judges on the bench that heard the case last year “ignored fictitious facts” produced before the court that PTI committed errors by joining SIC and contesting elections as independents.
All but two judges embraced the reality that PTI as a party contested and in fact won seats during the general election and therefore was entitled to reserved seats of women and non Muslims, the counsel emphasised.
When asked by Justice Jamal Mandokhail whether the Election Commission’s decision to allocate reser­ved seats to the Baloch­is­tan Awami Party after the 2018 general elections was right or wrong, Mr Raja replied that in his view, the decision could not be called “wrong”.
The members who contested the election as independents should not be forced to join a party that they did not intend to join before the election, said Mr Raja.

• Age limit to be fully removed from July 2026; quality standards to remain mandatory
• 40pc regulatory duty to end by 2029  • Panel sends its proposals to Senate
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb informed a parliamentary committee on Friday that restrictions on commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old will be lifted from September, in line with an International Monetary Fund condition and as part of a tariff strategy to gradually phase out overprotected sectors.
As of July 1, 2026, the age limit for importing used cars and vehicles will be lifted entirely. However, while age restrictions will end, strict compliance with quality standards will remain mandatory.
Although the matter was not listed on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue’s agenda, the minister disclosed the government’s four-year roadmap for used vehicle imports, which aims to align tax treatment for used and new vehicles.
The committee meeting was chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
The committee concluded its morning session by addressing pending agenda items, while the evening session focused on finalising recommendations to be presented in the Senate on Saturday.
Used vehicle imports
The finance minister announced that Pakistan will resume commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old, signalling a major shift in trade policy. He noted that the move could enhance the competitiveness of the auto sector and increase access to imported vehicles for the middle class, as the country fulfils its global fiscal obligations and adapts to evolving domestic demand.
Currently, commercial imports are restricted, even for cars that are just a month old. Under the Baggage Rules, only vehicles up to three years old — and up to five years for categories other than cars — are permitted for import by overseas Pakistanis under certain conditions.
 
 

Commerce ministry officials briefed the Senate committee that by the first quarter (July-September) of the new fiscal year, the government will issue a notification allowing commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old.
These imports will be subject to a 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to existing duties and taxes on new vehicles. From July 1, 2026, this duty will be gradually reduced: to 30pc in 2026, 20pc in 2027, 10pc in 2028, and fully eliminated by July 1, 2029. There will be no restrictions on importing any type of used vehicles, including heavy bikes.
It remains unclear whether the additional regulatory duty will apply to cars and other vehicles up to five years old imported under the Baggage Rules — specifically the Transfer of Residence and Gift schemes. Currently, the Baggage Rules permit the import of cars up to three years old and other vehicles up to five years old, subject to certain conditions.
It was clarified that vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme will require a minimum overseas residency of 700 days to qualify for exemptions.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, imports of used vehicles will continue to be subject to environmental and quality standards. However, from July 2026, while the age limit will be lifted for commercial imports, quality requirements will remain in force.
Currently, new car imports attract high duties and taxes. As part of ongoing tariff reforms, these levies will be reduced over the next five years, eventually capping at a maximum of 15pc. By the end of this period, the phased reduction of duties on new vehicles and the gradual removal of additional regulatory duties on used vehicles will be aligned.
Public Finance Management Act
Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee rejected the finance ministry’s proposed amendments to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), arguing that existing legislation already empowers institutions through parliament.
The ministry was directed to return with a formal draft of the revisions.
Finance ministry officials disclosed that when funds were requested from the Port Qasim Authority, the request was denied and the ministry was advised to contact the relevant department. A follow-up letter received no reply.
During proceedings, Senator Anusha Rahman sought clarification on the terms “surplus profit” and “idle cash”. Officials explained that surplus profit refers to annual financial gains, while idle cash denotes unutilised funds held in accounts during the fiscal year.
Senator Rahman recommended that companies be included within the scope of the PFMA alongside autonomous bodies — a suggestion the ministry accepted.
Meanwhile, the FBR provided an update on ongoing customs reforms to the committee.
The Member Customs Operations rep­orted that customs duties have been red­u­ced on 35pc of tariff lines, while new duty slabs of 5pc, 10pc and 15pc are being proposed to replace the existing 3pc, 11pc and 16pc tiers.
Additionally, duties will be eliminated on 916 more tariff lines, raising the total number of zero-rated lines to 3,117.

Lawmakers in the lower House of Commons chamber voted 314 in favour to 291 to send the proposal to the upper House of Lords for further scrutiny following four hours of emotional debate.
The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside parliament who say legalised euthanasia will give people with an incurable illness dignity and choice at the end of their lives.
But opponents attending a neighbouring counter-protest said they feared vulnerable people could be coerced into dying and urged lawmakers to focus on improving palliative care instead.

Outcome sparks celebrations among supporters outside parliament

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults who have been given less than six months to live.
They would have to be able to administer the life-ending substance themselves, and any patient’s wish to die would have to be signed off by two doctors and a panel of experts.
A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying, including Belgium and the Netherlands.
‘Heartbreaking stories’
Labour MP Kim Lead­beater, who proposed the legislation, told Friday’s so-called third reading debate that a law change would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” for terminally ill people.
She said maintaining the status quo would mean more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations”.
 
 

But Vicky Foxcroft, also of Labour, said the proposal did not include adequate safeguards for disabled people.
“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn’t value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she pleaded.
Outside parliament, protesters waved placards with slogans including “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers”.
David Walker, 82, said he supported changing the law because he saw his wife of 60 years suffer for three years at the end of her life.
“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.
But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, said she feared the legislation would open “slippery slope” where those eligible for assisted dying expands.
“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients… are vulnerable,” she told AFP.
Public support
MPs in the 650-seat parliament backed an earlier version of the proposed legislation by 330 to 275 votes at an initial vote in parliament last November, a larger majority than Friday’s 23.
Since then the bill has undergone several changes, including applying a ban on adverts for assisted dying and allowing all health workers to opt out of helping someone end their life.
MPs added a safeguard which would prevent a person being eligible “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking”, ruling out people with anorexia.
Britain’s medical community and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s top ministerial team are split on the proposed law change. Starmer voted in favour, while his health and justice secretaries opposed it.
But in a YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, surveyed last month and published Thursday, 73 per cent or respondents backed an assisted dying law.
“Change is coming,” hailed Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the Dignity in Dying campaign group.
But Catherine Robinson of Right To Life UK insisted the bill “still faces an uphill battle” to get through the Lords and her opposition campaign group “will be fighting it at every stage” to prevent it becoming law.
The House of Lords now needs to approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or the bill will fail.
If it passes and receives royal assent, it would still be four years before an assisted dying service was implemented.
 
 

A government impact assessment published this month estimated that approximately 160 to 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, rising to a possible 4,500 in a decade.
Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Separate legislation is going through the devolved Scottish parliament.
At the end of March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.

In a post shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.
Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.
It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.
The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, President Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.
It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.
“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.
 
 

The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere offers” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.
“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.
The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.
In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating escalation involving Iran.
Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained in a recent conversation with US President Donald Trump that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press statement.</p><small>2025-06-21 02:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610192-pivotal-moment-pakistan-urges-unsc-to-urgently-act-over-iran-israel-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>'Pivotal moment': Pakistan urges UNSC to 'urgently' act over Iran-Israel conflict</strong></a><br><p>

Wana Police Spokesperson Habib Islam told Dawn.com: “The attack took place after 11am, as a result of which one child was killed while five people were injured.”
Makin Station House Officer Abdul Qadir Mehsud also confirmed the drone attack and told Dawn.com locals have set a date for June 23 to hold a jirga with the higher authorities regarding law and order, in which they have invited people belonging to every school of thought.
KP MPA Asif Khan Mehsood told Dawn.com that the alleged incident involved a drone which “targeted school children,” although it was not known whether the drone was Pakistani or from another country.
PTI MNA Zubair Khan Wazir strongly condemned the incident. “Targeting innocent schoolchildren is a deeply distressing and unforgivable act,” he said in a statement on social media.
“This is a grave incident that warrants a thorough and impartial investigation so that the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
The incident was condemned by other politicians from the province as well, such as Afrasiab Khattak and Mohsin Dawar.
Last month, seven minors were among 22 people injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil.
The incident came within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing on May 27 that they had ended their protest after reaching an agreement with the local administration.
In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.
An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district killed one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p><small>2025-06-20 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/202039428896d34.jpg?r=204540' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918479/pm-shehbaz-expresses-satisfaction-on-cordial-and-productive-coas-trump-meeting-in-call-with-rubio' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz expresses satisfaction on ‘cordial and productive’ COAS-Trump meeting in call with Rubio</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday expressed satisfaction on the “cordial and productive discussion” between US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The COAS, who visited Washington earlier this week, was invited to a luncheon at the White House and discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during a “cordial” meeting with Trump, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
Field Marshal Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the PM’s conversation with Washington’s top diplomat was described as “warm and cordial”, with the discussion revolving around key bilateral and regional issues.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the recent meeting between President Trump and … Field Marshal Asim Munir, in Washington, terming it productive and cordial,” the report read.
“The prime minister conveyed his best wishes for US President Donald Trump, lauding his bold leadership and commending Secretary Rubio’s diplomatic efforts that facilitated a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India,” PTV News reported. “He emphasised that this understanding averted a potential catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.”
 
 

The PM was also quoted as saying that Trump’s “positive remarks” about Pakistan were encouraging for lasting peace in the region and reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to resolve disputes with India — namely the Kashmir issue, the Indus Waters Treaty and counter-terrorism — through dialogue.
Discussing security, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and counter groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“Secretary Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and assured full US cooperation in addressing these threats,” PTV News reported.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for Pakistan and the US to enhance collaboration in sectors including trade, investment, energy, mining, rare earth minerals and information technology.
“Both sides agreed that their discussions should now lead to concrete action across multiple areas of mutual interest. To further strengthen ties, the prime minister emphasised the importance of frequent high-level exchanges,” PTV News reported, adding that the PM extended an invitation to Trump and Rubio to visit Pakistan.
“Secretary Rubio expressed appreciation for the call and reaffirmed the US’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Pakistan,” PTV News said. “He praised Pakistan’s adherence to the ceasefire with India and its continued efforts for peace in the region, especially given its close ties with Iran.
“Rubio affirmed Washington’s intent to work closely with Islamabad to promote regional and global peace and stability.”
Pakistan has been steadily improving ties with the US.
Earlier this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their economic partnership as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.
“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards [a] competitive economy.”
In March, it was announced that Pakistan and the US would hold a counter-terrorism dialogue in June.
This was agreed during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. During the meeting, Pakistan-US relations, matters of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation were discussed in detail.
Bilawal lauds Trump’s talks with army chief
In his remarks on the recent conflict with India, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who was addressing a crowd in Karachi upon his return from a foreign diplomatic tour, said, “For the first time in history, the leader of Pakistan’s army, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has a meeting with Trump at the White House.”
Bilawal questioned India’s claims, saying, “If Pakistan is ‘terroristan’ [and] involved in terrorism, then what is our military leader doing in Washington?”
He said, “What does the field marshal’s meeting at the White House signify then?” adding, “Is the general of a failed nation called there? No.”
“This highlights that India lost the war and Pakistan won the war. The talks were a congratulatory meeting,” he added. “I consider this a success for Pakistan by the US.”

As relations between Russia and the Taliban government have been improving, an Afghan delegation is visiting Russia’s main economic conference in St Petersburg this week, meeting Russian agriculture officials.
“Afghanistan is definitely aiming for self-sufficiency in its agricultural products. However, we still rely on some food items that come from Iran, and if problems arise there, it will undoubtedly have its effects,” Ataullah Omari said on the sidelines of the conference.
Iran supplies Afghanistan with some dairy products, among other commodities, and there is widespread concern that the week-old war between Israel and Iran could disrupt trade flows.
Russia — the world’s largest wheat exporter — and Kazakhstan are the main suppliers of wheat and flour to Afghanistan. Russia is also supplying sugar and vegetable oil.
Omari said that the country is now seeking wheat rather than flour from Russia.
Afghanistan, the top buyer of Russian flour in 2024, increased its own wheat production by 10 per cent last year to 4.83 million metric tonnes. The country’s total wheat consumption is estimated at 6.8m metric tonnes a year.
“For the past four years, since the withdrawal of the Americans, we have been making efforts to provide our essential food supplies ourselves. The remaining amount, including flour and wheat, is supplied annually by Russia,” Omari said.
“We have requested that Russia send us wheat instead of flour. Additionally, the import of other products that come from Russia to our country annually is progressing well,” he added.
In April, Russia lifted its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated as a terrorist organisation for more than two decades, paving the way for Moscow to normalise ties with Afghanistan’s leadership.
Since 2022, Afghanistan has imported gas, oil, and wheat from Russia, marking the first major economic deal after the Taliban returned to power, facing international isolation following 20 years of war against US-led forces.
Omari expressed concern about Afghan refugees living in Iran who could become victims of Israel’s attacks. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that nearly 4.5m Afghan nationals reside in Iran.
“Any kind of damage that occurs there is absolutely unsatisfactory for our nation and our people, especially for many of our refugees who live there and are our brothers,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-20 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201704313e38ea7.jpg?r=170722' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918424/police-book-2-suspects-for-gang-rape-of-social-media-influencer-in-kps-haripur' target='_blank'><strong>Police book 2 suspects for gang-rape of social media influencer in KP’s Haripur</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police have filed a case against two suspects for allegedly gang-raping a 26-year-old social media influencer in Haripur district by luring her on the pretext of a job, it emerged on Friday.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed on the woman’s complaint at Haripur district’s Khanpur Police Station a day ago under Sections 34 (common intention), 376 (punishment for rape), 392 (punishment for robbery) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation; If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the incident occurred in Khanpur tehsil on Wednesday at 8pm.
The victim, who hails from Taxila, said she was “contacted by the suspect through her TikTok account and offered a job at a hotel in Khanpur”.
She added, “The suspect called me for an interview. When I reached the bus stop, they picked me up in their car and drove a few miles away, where they forced me to strip at gunpoint.”
The FIR said that an unknown man was driving the car, with the other suspect sitting in the front seat. It added that the two suspects subsequently raped her and later fled with her mobile phone, Rs3,000 and a gold pendant after leaving her on the side of the road.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Earlier this month, Hafizabad police launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in the district and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.
The previous month, a stage actress was gang-raped by four suspects near Nishtar Chowk, Sadiqabad.
In March, Punjab police arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p><small>2025-06-20 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610160-pakistan-defeated-india-on-battlefield-diplomatic-front-says-bilawal-after-returning-to-country' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan defeated India on battlefield, diplomatic front, says Bilawal after returning to country</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Federal Minister for Health, Mustafa Kamal, on Thursday claimed that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.
According to the press release, the 33-month-old boy from Bannu’s Shamsikhel Union Council is the sixth case of polio reported from KP this year.
“To date in 2025, Pakistan has reported a total of 12 cases of polio, including six from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the laboratory said.
The regional laboratory noted that the southern districts of KP remain areas of concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination.
“These barriers result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,” the statement read.
“The Polio Eradication Programme urges all parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of polio vaccine,” it added. “Each dose strengthens immunity and offers lifelong protection. Community engagement and support remain critical to stopping the transmission of poliovirus once and for all.”
Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.
The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third immunisation drive of the year against the crippling disease last month at the National Emergency Operations Centre in Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.</p><small>2025-06-20 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20185212ea443b4.jpg?r=185219' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918442/byc-members-continue-hunger-strike-against-leaders-detention-in-balochistans-kech' target='_blank'><strong>BYC members continue hunger strike against leaders’ detention in Balochistan’s Kech</strong></a><br><p>Members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s (BYC) Kech chapter continued their hunger strike for a second consecutive day on Friday, protesting the alleged  “illegal detention” of their leaders and the “extrajudicial arrests of Baloch citizens”.
BYC chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
They were sent to jail under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordnance, which empowers authorities to “arrest and detain suspected persons”. Mahrang and the other activists remain incarcerated.
The Kech chapter launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club on Thursday, according to the group’s X account.
“Despite the blistering 50°C heat, members of the Baloch nation are courageously participating in the hunger strike,” the BYC wrote in a post. “Their message is clear: protect and save BYC leaders and stand united against injustice.”
During the protest, the BYC alleged in posts that the demonstration had been disrupted by police and “traffic accidents”.
“For the third time, traffic accidents damaged the camp. If anyone gets injured, police authorities will be held responsible,” the BYC wrote, enclosing a video of the demonstration along the side of the road.
 






In April, Mahrang and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to district jail Pishin.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Earlier this month, Mahrang moved the Supreme Court against the Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) May 22 order that dismissed constitutional petitions challenging her detention and that of two other Baloch leaders.
In May, Amnesty International and four other human rights organisations had called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent.</p><small>2025-06-20 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610143-us-encourages-pakistan-to-continue-playing-its-role-in-peace-efforts-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>US encourages Pakistan to continue playing its role in peace efforts with Iran</strong></a><br><p>

Mansehra Rescue 1122 spokesperson Amir Khadam Khan told Dawn.com that the incident occurred near Sohni Waterfall in the Naran area.
“[The] tourists, hailing from Lahore, were taking selfies near the glacier when it slid down, burying them underneath.”
He added that the bodies of the tourists were recovered from the glacier and moved to a nearby hospital, where they were identified as 35-year-old Mohammad Tahir, 22-year-old Mohammad Tayyab, and 13-year-old Abubakar.
Adviser to Chief Minister KP on Tourism, Zahid Chanze,b extended his condolences to the bereaved families and said, “Arrangements were being made to dispatch the bodies to Lahore.”
In a statement, he urged tourists to avoid taking selfies near dangerous spots and glaciers, saying glaciers were rapidly melting due to the hot weather.
He also said that they would launch a campaign across the province for the tourists to adapt and abide by safety precautions while visiting the places.
Last month, four tourists from Gujrat who went missing in Gilgit-Baltistan on May 16 were found dead at the bank of the Indus River near Istak village in Skardu’s Roundu valley.
In March, a UN report warned that rapidly melting glaciers and snow have imperilled the global ecosystem and billions of people who rely on freshwater from these sources.
The report said glaciers were at extreme risk due to global warming, pollution, and unsustainable human activities, and if not properly managed, they could become a source of perpetual conflicts.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610132-earthquake-of-28-magnitude-jolts-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi experiences two more mild earthquakes, brings tally to 49</strong></a><br><p>

The government, which owns or controls much of the power infrastructure, is grappling with ballooning circular debt, unpaid bills and subsidies that have choked the sector and weighed on the economy.
The liquidity crunch has disrupted supply, discouraged investment and added
to fiscal pressure, making it a key focus under the $7 billion IMF programme.
“Finding funds to plug the gap has been a persistent challenge, with limited fiscal space and high-cost legacy debt making resolution efforts more difficult. Eighteen commercial banks will provide these loans through Islamic financing,” Power Minister Awais Leghari told Reuters.
“It will be repaid in 24 quarterly instalments over six years.”
The facility, structured under Islamic principles, is secured at a concessional rate of three-month KIBOR minus 0.9 per cent — a formula agreed on by the IMF.
Leghari said it will not add to the public debt. Existing liabilities carry higher costs, including late payment surcharges on Independent Power Producers (IPPs) of up to KIBOR plus 4.5pc, and older loans ranging slightly above benchmark rates.
Meezan Bank, HBL, National Bank of Pakistan and UBL are among the banks participating in the deal, he said.
The government expects to allocate Rs323bn annually to repay the loan, capped at Rs1.938tr over six years.
The agreement also aligns with the government’s target of eliminating interest-based banking by 2028, with Islamic finance now comprising about a quarter of total banking assets.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/201157053fa6e18.png?r=190734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382/coas-munir-stresses-potential-for-broader-multidimensional-ties-with-us-built-on-mutual-respect' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‘broader, multidimensional’ ties with US built on mutual respect</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with the United States, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
COAS Munir is on a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — has accompanied Field Marshal Munir.
COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the “comprehensive and candid exchange”, ISPR added.
The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence”, the statement said.
 
 

Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Field Marshal Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development”.
In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.
The army chief also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”, the statement added.
He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict with India and “elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly noted that Pakistan lost 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.
During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.
The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.
 
 

He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the Israel-Iran war as the US weighs whether to intervene militarily or not.
Participants, the ISPR said, noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”. “The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.
The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, the military’s media wing noted. It reflected the country’s “commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue”.</p><small>2025-06-20 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20175937604442c.png?r=181551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918448/pakistan-down-france-3-2-in-penalty-shoot-out-to-reach-fih-hockey-nations-cup-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan down France 3-2 in penalty shoot-out to reach FIH Hockey Nations Cup final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan qualified for the finals of the FIH Hockey Nations Cup after defeating France on Friday in the first semi-final match in Kuala Lumpur.

An under-trial prisoner was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the lavatory of the Attock District Jail in April. Prison officials had claimed that the prisoner had taken his own life by hanging himself with a drawstring. The inmate’s body was found by his fellow prisoners hanging from the window of the jail washroom.
An order from the home department, issued a day ago, said Deputy Superintendent Executive Sarmad Hassan, Assistant Superintendent Mushtaq Ahmed, Chief Warden Muhammad Rafiq, Head Warden Zulfiqar and Warden Muhammad Ayub were placed under suspension for 90 days with immediate effect on charges of “inefficiency, negligence and misconduct” under Section 6 of Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006.
A statement from the home department spokesperson said the five were suspended for “abuse of authority, mismanagement and incompetence” after they were “found involved in torture on a prisoner”.
He said torturing any prisoner was not allowed under prison rules and the home department was implementing a “zero tolerance” policy against violation of laws and abuse of authority.
The statement pointed out that Attock Jail Superintendent Arif Shahbaz had already been removed from his post and transferred to Lahore.
The spokesperson said the home department had issued rules and regulations for the management and administration of all jails across the province, prohibiting the torture of prisoners.
In February, the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights voiced concerns about the dire conditions in prisons, particularly crowding and prolonged delays in justice for death row inmates.
According to Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), a non-profit organisation based in Lahore that represents the most vulnerable Pakistani prisoners, “police torture is endemic and systematic in Pakistan.”
Research carried out by the JPP shows “torture is accepted as an inevitable part of law enforcement in Pakistan, and perpetrators of torture are granted impunity through a combination of socio-cultural acceptance, lack of independent oversight, widespread powers of arrest and detention, procedural loopholes and ineffective safeguards, including Pakistan’s failure to criminalise torture despite being a signatory of the UN Convention Against Torture.”</p><small>2025-06-20 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20130506fc9045c.png?r=161054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918401/australian-trial-says-tech-for-social-media-teen-ban-can-work' target='_blank'><strong>Australian trial says tech for social media teen ban can work</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s world-leading ban on under 16s joining social media sites cleared a big hurdle on Friday as a trial found digital age checks can work “robustly and effectively”, according to AFP.
Australian lawmakers passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media in November 2024, approving one of the world’s toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X.
Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and X could face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32m) for failing to comply with the legislation.
They have described the law — which is due to come into effect by the end of this year — as vague, rushed and “problematic”.
 
 

There has been widespread concern over children’s use of online platforms as evidence shows that social media can have negative effects on children’s mental and physical health.
Digital age verification systems — which would be critical to the ban — can work, said the interim findings of an independent Age Assurance Technology Trial, conducted for the government.
“These preliminary findings indicate that age assurance can be done in Australia privately, robustly and effectively,” it said.
There are “no significant technological barriers” to deploying age-checking systems in Australia, said the trial’s project director, Tony Allen.
“These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said in a statement.
In a separate interview with Australia’s Nine Network, Allen said preventing children from circumventing age verification tools was a “big challenge”, however.
“I don’t think anything is completely foolproof,” he said.
 


There are a “plethora” of approaches to age verification but no single solution to suit all cases, said the trial report, in which 53 organisations took part.
Australia’s legislation is being closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.

Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
The senator’s comment came during a keynote address at the Pakistan-China Dialogue hosted by the Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) under the auspices of the “Friends of Silk Road”, according to a statement by the PCI. The event was attended by diplomats, parliamentarians, students and scholars.
Mushahid, who serves as the PCI chairman, observed: “The global balance of economic and political power is shifting from West to East, heralding the Asian Century.”
He lauded China’s “peaceful rise as a source of strength for developing nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America” and thanked Beijing for its unwavering support of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, especially last month in the face of Indian aggression.
 
 

Condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iranian territory, the senator called the attacks “a flagrant violation of International Law and the UN Charter” and rejected narratives promoting a “new Cold War or so-called China threat”.
“Security is preserved through cooperation, not military blocs, or demonising countries through disinformation”, he stressed.
The event was also attended by a five-member delegation from the Communist Party of China’s International Department (IDCPC) led by its spokesperson, Ambassador Hu Zhaoming.
Speakers celebrated the enduring “Iron Brothers” partnership, championing a multipolar order based on the UN Charter, and highlighted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a catalyst for peace, prosperity and regional connectivity.
PCI Executive Director Mustafa Hyder Sayed, who was also the dialogue moderator, noted that the historic Silk Road friendship between Pakistan and China “has never been transactional or tactical”. “Rather, it is rooted in shared history, trust and a common commitment to uplift the wider neighbourhood.”
He termed the dialogue as part of PCI’s broader effort to amplify voices from Asia and the Global South, given the changing global scenario.
Pointing to escalating Cold War rhetoric, he condemned the newly created US Congress’s “Countering PRC Influence Fund,” which authorises $325m per year from 2023 to 2027 to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and Government of China worldwide.
Mustafa called the measure “a Cold-War-era throwback that diverts resources from development and dialogue, precisely the opposite of what our region needs”.
IDCPC’s Zhaoming said Pakistan was “etched in the deepest hearts of the Chinese people”, adding that “China and Pakistan are like two sides of the same coin — you cannot choose one without the other.”
Highlighting the BRI’s evolution since 2013, Ambassador Hu noted that over 150 countries now participate in the initiative, which “promotes China’s own inland development while fostering global connectivity.” He urged younger generations to “carry the torch of friendship forward.”
Minister of State for Climate Change, Dr Shezra Mansab Ali Kharal, argued that the current world order was “visibly fragmenting”, while China consistently advocated multipolarity, non-intervention and equality among states.
“The BRI embodies this vision,” she said, stressing “fostering a network of interdependent economies that choose dialogue over conflict”.
 
 

Former foreign secretary Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry echoed the call for cooperative paradigms during what he called “a time of flux where wars erupt and rules collapse”.
He said President Xi’s philosophy of “win-win cooperation and mutual respect” offered “the most promising foundation for a future world order when the dust settles”.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Aqeel Malik emphasised that “security and stability are paramount” for CPEC’s success. He proposed Afghanistan’s inclusion in CPEC, calling it “a natural extension of the shared-future vision”.</p><small>2025-06-20 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/20132354b4e5265.png?r=152441' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918402/sana-yousaf-murder-case-islamabad-court-extends-suspects-physical-remand-by-3-days' target='_blank'><strong>Sana Yousaf murder case: Islamabad court extends suspect’s physical remand by 3 days</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court on Friday extended the physical remand of the main suspect in the murder case of social media influencer Sana Yousaf for another three days.
Islamabad Police had arrested Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old’s murder, on June 3, nearly a day after she was gunned down in her house in the federal capital. Police had claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.
Hayat was presented before the court of Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Hafeez upon the completion of his four-day physical remand. His 14-day judicial remand at the Adiala Jail for his identification parade had already been completed, with the victim’s mother and aunt identifying him.
 
 

Deputy district public prosecutors (DDPPs) Adnan Ali and Raja Naveed Hussain, along with Investigation Officer (IO) Mazhar Bashir Khan, appeared on behalf of the state before Magistrate Hafeez.
Hussain informed the judge that the vehicle used by the suspect had been recovered, while his phone was yet to be taken into custody. “The suspect is quite clever and understands the gravity of the crime, which is why he is not letting us recover his mobile phone,” he said.
IO Bashir then requested the court to extend the detained man’s remand by seven days for further “investigation and recovery”, according to the written order.
However, the magistrate approved the remand for another three days, directing the police to produce the suspect before the court on June 23.
 
 

Sana’s mobile phone and the murder weapon had been recovered from the suspect’s possession when he was arrested.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.
The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from citizens, celebrities and even President Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter, MNA Aseefa.</p><small>2025-06-20 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610095-how-is-balochistan-being-affected-by-iran-israel-war' target='_blank'><strong>How is Balochistan being affected by Iran-Israel war?</strong></a><br><p>

The latest salvo in trade tensions between the 27-nation bloc and China covers a wide range of healthcare supplies, from surgical masks to X-ray machines, that represent a market worth 150 billion euros in the EU.
“Our aim with these measures is to level the playing field for EU businesses,” the bloc’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said. “We remain committed to dialogue with China to resolve these issues.”
In response, China accused the EU of “double standards”.
“The EU has always boasted that it is the most open market in the world, but in reality, it has gradually moved towards protectionism”, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a regular press briefing.
“Under the guise of fair competition (the EU) actually carries out unfair competition, which is a typical case of double standards.”
The European Commission said in a statement the move was in “response to China’s longstanding exclusion of EU-made medical devices from Chinese government contracts.”
Brussels said just under 90 per cent of public procurement contracts for medical devices in China “were subject to exclusionary and discriminatory measures” against EU firms.
In addition to barring Chinese firms from major state purchases, “inputs from China for successful bids” would also be limited to 50pc, it said.
Over the last three years, Brussels and Beijing have come into conflict in a number of economic sectors, including electric cars, the rail industry, solar panels and wind turbines.
The decision on medical devices comes at a time of heightened trade tensions with President Donald Trump’s United States, which has imposed customs surcharges on imports from all over the world, including Europe.
The EU has decided to take a tougher stance on trade in recent years, adopting a vast arsenal of legislation to better defend its businesses against unfair competition.
In April 2024, the commission opened an investigation into Chinese public contracts for medical devices, the first under a new mechanism introduced by the EU in 2022 to obtain better access to overseas state purchases.
China, on the other hand, accuses Europe of protectionism.
After a year of negotiations, the commission, which manages trade policy on behalf of the 27 member states, said it had failed to make any progress with China.
“The measure seeks to incentivise China to cease its discrimination against EU firms and EU-made medical devices and treat EU companies with the same openness as the EU does with Chinese companies and products,” Brussels said.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610084-pakistans-backing-for-iran-remains-firm-after-trump-munir-talks' target='_blank'><strong>‘100% the same': Pakistan's backing for Iran remains firm after Trump-Munir meeting</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier in the month, the government claimed to have dismantled an international child exploitation network operating out of a so-called gaming club in Muzaffargarh, where children aged six to 10 were lured, abused and filmed for the sake of selling their videos on the dark web.
“Several children were sexually abused and filmed in Sardarabad village,” a police statement said today.
The matter came to light when one of the victims contacted the police. According to the statement, the suspect had been blackmailing the children using compromised videos.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was lodged at Saddar police station in Muzaffargarh district under section 292 (sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene material) and section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a boy was sexually abused and filmed by his older brother’s former employer when he went to collect his brother’s pending wages. The older brother had previously worked for the suspect as an animal caretaker.
The statement added that the Sadar police station has arrested the suspect, while the victims were being contacted for legal action.
In Pakistan, the punishment for sexually abusing a minor can range from seven years to life imprisonment, while rape of a child carries the death penalty or life term. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020 were enacted to address rising cases of abuse, strengthen penalties, and ensure timely action. Offences related to child pornography are punishable by up to 14 years in prison, along with hefty fines.
 
 

Despite existing laws, cases of child sexual abuse continue to surface across the country.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ’Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
In April, Punjab police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p><small>2025-06-20 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2011085788df287.png?r=110917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918254/punjab-assembly-session-marred-by-watch-theft-long-suspension-and-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly session marred by ‘watch theft’, long suspension and delay</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly descended into pandemonium as the general debate on the provincial budget commenced, leading to a nearly two-hour suspension of the proceedings amidst intense sloganeering by the government and opposition benches on Thursday.
The members reportedly damaged microphones. A Treasury MPA accused an opposition member of stealing his watch, fueling the chaos.
The session, presided over by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, began three hours and 35 minutes behind schedule and immediately plunged into disarray.
The uproar began when treasury MPA Bilal Yamin accused opposition member Ejaz Shafi of stealing his watch. This ignited a furious reaction from the opposition that countered with slogans of ‘Nawaz Sharif is a thief!’. As opposition members streamed into the House in protest, the accusation of the stolen watch echoed through the chamber, with government members waving their watches and chanting ‘watch thief’.
Speaker Khan struggled to restore order.
Bilal Yamin insisted that the opposition’s uproar was an attempt to distract from the watch theft.

Treasury MPA accuses Opp member of stealing his watch

The speaker was forced to adjourn the session and summoned parliamentary affairs minister Mujtaba Shuja, Samiullah Khan and Opposition Leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to his chamber for negotiations. After an hour and fifty minutes, the session resumed. However, as soon as opposition members reentered the house, sloganeering restarted from both sides.
Watch issue
The House, once again, erupted with noise with the speaker’s calls for “Order in the House!” going unheeded. Bilal Yamin, speaking on a point of order, clarified that the commotion was to avoid discussion on his watch, which, he alleged, Ejaz Shafi had snatched from his hand on June 16 during a scuffle in the session. He stated that the watch, though not expensive, held sentimental value due to its connection with his father.
In response, Shafi denied the ‘false and baseless’ accusation. Shafi went on to say that, “it’s not just the Sharif family, but this entire party is full of thieves”. He further demanded that the chief minister who, he claimed, had not attended the House for an entire year, should be searched before him. Following these accusations, the speaker announced the formation of a committee to investigate the matter.
After the commotion subsided, Bhachar began the general debate on the budget 2025-26. The speaker initially cautioned the opposition leader against reading his speech, citing rules that only allow the finance minister to do so. Bhachar agreed to abide by the restrictions.
‘Anti-people budget’
Commencing his speech, the opposition leader declared the proposed budget as ‘anti-people’, asserting that budgets should provide relief to the poor. He accused the current government of prioritising political actions against PTI, specifically ‘torturing’ PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. He questioned the sudden increase in the development budget from Rs842 billion to Rs1.24 trillion, arguing that the government lacked the capacity for such expenditure.
 
 

While acknowledging an increase in the education budget, he demanded a review of public schools to identify where the funds were actually needed. He noted the absence of new development projects despite the increased budget allocation.
Citing the ‘Rehri Programme’ (cart programme) in which a company estimated Rs98,000 per cart but the metropolitan officers deliberately awarded the contract to a company that estimated Rs149,000 per cart. Bhachar also criticised the Rs150 million ‘Bike Lane’ project, which he claimed, was washed away in the first rain despite the CM’s assurance of a one-year warranty.
Bhachar reiterated his earlier concerns about the Ramazan Nigehbaan Programme, alleging embezzlement by 93 government employees.
Agricultural distress
The opposition leader highlighted the plight of farmers due to the wheat crisis, stating that wheat cultivation was at its lowest this year, leaving the farmers struggling while the government favoured specific individuals. He claimed that the farmers faced a loss of Rs36,000 per acre due to the government’s policies.
Bhachar disputed the government’s claim of 1.5m farmers in Punjab, asserting the number was over 80m. He accused the government of exploiting farmers through the ‘Kisan Card’ and withholding over Rs20bn in farmer funds. He also pointed to a 30pc decline in cotton production and over Rs22bn loss for wheat farmers since 2023.
Regarding education, he said that out of 49,000 schools, 25,000 had been outsourced, and 33pc of children were out of school, with more schools being outsourced.

The apex court also said that the people must not be deprived of the park’s utility, subject to a nominal entrance fee meant for its maintenance.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar was hearing a civil petition filed against an order of the Sindh High Court (SHC) at the SC’s Karachi Registry.
 
 

It also allowed a request by the counsel for the respondents to transfer the matter to the principal seat at Islamabad after seeking the approval of the chief justice of Pakistan, as the lawyer submitted that, since the injunctive order had been passed, the interests of the respondents were at stake.

Bench rules ordinary people should not be deprived of park’s utility

Citing DHA, Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC), M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited and others as respondents, the managing committee of Masjid-i-Saheem, located at Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase VI, DHA, along with some neighbouring residents, moved the apex court through their counsel Khawaja Shams-ul-Islam against an order of the SHC passed on March 11.
The bench in its order said that the lawyer for the petitioners had placed before it a case whereby it was claimed that a “public park” meant for the use of common persons was now being licensed to an entity for its commercial gain and that every individual entering the park would be charged exorbitantly.
The counsel also argued that the purpose of the amenity, i.e. public park, cannot be changed into any other amenity, depriving the public at large from utilising it solely as a park.
The lawyer for the petitioners also maintained that although a division bench of the SHC dealt with some of the issues, including the locus standi of the petitioners, nonetheless, a public interest litigation was involved.
Representing the respondents, Advocate Hussain Ali Almani asserted that public entry was not restricted, but it would be subject to an entrance fee for the jogging track.
He also submitted that presently, the respondents were raising a jogging track and had planned to construct padel courts and other allied structures.
The bench in its order said, “We are of the view that apart from the jogging track, no structure of the nature as licensed to them or otherwise, be raised till the next date of hearing and the common person shall not be deprived to park’s utility subject to nominal fee meant for its maintenance.”
At this juncture, the counsel for the respondents requested for the transfer of the case to the principal seat of the apex court, as he submitted that the interests of the respondents were at stake after issuance of the injunctive order.
Thereafter, the bench directed its office to transfer the case to the principal seat in Islamabad for further hearing, after seeking approval of the chief justice, and to fix it for hearing in the opening week after the summer vacations.
The petitioners contended that the amenity plot/parking lot in question was adjacent to the mosque, the entrance of which was connected with the masjid, and that it was a park admeasuring over two acres.
They also asserted that the present controversy arose when M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited had started demolishing/altering the main gate of the masjid and parking lot, and after a long discussion the petitioners were told that the parking lot had been given to the private firm by way of a licence agreement executed between the firm and DHA and CBC.
They further argued that the contract, without an open auction or any public tender and without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, was seriously hampering the right of access to the mosque, as the namazis had been using the designated parking of the masjid for over 30 years.
The petitioners asserted that the impugned SHC order dismissing their petition suffered from legal infirmity, as it ought to have appreciated that state functionaries, in awarding contracts, must act fairly, reasonably, honestly and justly and that the high court has the power to judicially review administrative actions to check their fairness, reasonableness and transparency.
