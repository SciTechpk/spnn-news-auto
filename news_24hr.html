The bill, which seeks to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, reached the presidency on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the CII ruling that classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.
 
 

“The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025 is assented to, as passed by the Parliament,” the notification read.
“Pakistan has reached a milestone in the enactment of important legislation against child marriages,” Rehman said in a statement.
She said that the approval of the bill was successful despite resistance from various sections, adding that President Zardari signed the bill despite pressure.
“The signing of the Child Marriage Restraint Bill is a symbol of a new era of reforms in Pakistan,” she said.
She hailed the approval as a victory for the protection of the rights of women and children, adding, “This law was possible after a long and difficult struggle.”
“This bill is not just a law, it is a commitment that our girls have the right to education, health and a prosperous life,” Rehman continued.
She thanked PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, party leaders, other political parties, representatives of the opposition and the public for their support for the bill.
She also called on other provinces to take steps towards this important legislation.
Earlier, CII member Maulana Jalaludin, who belongs to the JUI-F, said Presi­dent Zardari should prevent anarchy in society and not sign the bill.
Incidentally, members bel­ong­ing to different sects opposed the bill.
Responding to a query, the CII member had said the assembly could not be above the Holy Quran and Sunnah. “This bill is not only against the norms of Sharia but also contrary to the values of our society and our traditions,” Maulana Jalaluddin reasoned, terming the move a western conspiracy to destroy ‘family system’.
The ‘bad intentions’ were evident as the bill was not forwarded to the CII, but approved by parliament ‘in secrecy’, he said.
However, PPP MNA Sharmila Faruqi, who tabled the bill in the National Assembly, said the matter of marriage of girls below 18 years of age, should not be given a religious colour and instead be considered in the context of human rights.
“We are not against marriages. We say marrying girls as young as 13 or 14 years is unfair when girls under 18 years of age do not have right to vote, cannot obtain national identity cards and driving licence,” she added.
In this regard, the PPP lawmaker referred to a decision by Federal Shariat Court of 2022 that allowed the state to set the marriage age.</p><small>2025-05-30 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30112633e684b08.jpg?r=112642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914255/karachiites-continue-to-face-sweltering-weather' target='_blank'><strong>Karachiites continue to face sweltering weather</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Karachiites experienced another day of intense heat as the temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius on Thursday.

“Inflation is projected to remain between 1.5-2.0 per cent in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0pc by June”, significantly higher than a record low of 0.3pc in April, the MoF said in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for May.
It stated that the LSM activity remained sluggish so far, but its outlook may improve gradually in the coming months, with recovery expected to be gradual amid continued year-over-year (YoY) contraction and a recent month-over-month (MoM) decline. Nonetheless, improvements in high-frequency indicators — such as rising automobile output, raw material imports, and a more accommodative monetary stance — indicate cautious optimism, it said.
The MoF said the improved weather conditions and increased water availability were likely to support higher crop yields and better farming conditions, contributing to overall economic growth. Exports and remittances are expected to maintain their upward trend in the coming months, keeping the current account within a manageable range.

Govt expects gradual recovery in big industry production

It stated that Pakistan’s rating upgrade by Fitch Ratings was an acknowledgment of macroeconomic stabilisation in the outgoing fiscal year, supported by improved fiscal performance, a current account surplus, and easing inflation.
Revenue growth outpaced expenditure, reducing the fiscal deficit and further strengthening the primary surplus. The current account posted a $1.9 billion surplus, with a robust growth in exports and remittances. Inflation declined to a record low, paving the way for a more accommodative monetary policy stance. Climate finance initiatives, including the Resilient and Sustainable Facility from the IMF and the launching of the Green Sukuk, reinforced the path toward inclusive and sustainable growth.
It said the fiscal indicators demonstrated enhanced management discipline. During July-March FY25, total revenue grew by 36.7pc to Rs13.367tr, compared to Rs9.78tr last year, led by a 68pc rise in non-tax revenues which reached Rs4.23tr, mainly driven by SBP profits, petroleum levy, dividends, and surcharges.The Federal Board of Revenue collection, on the other hand, increased by just 26.3pc to Rs9.3tr during July-April FY25, up from Rs7.362tr last year, but significantly lower than budgeted target.
Total expenditures rose by 19.4pc to Rs16.34tr, with current spending increasing by 18.3pc and development expenditures by 32.6pc.
As a result, the fiscal deficit declined to 2.6pc of GDP (from 3.7pc) while the primary surplus improved to Rs3.469tr (3pc of GDP) from Rs1.615tr (1.5pc) last year.

At a meeting held at the CM House on Thursday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar agreed to collaborate on a series of ambitious projects, including the Karachi Coastal Comprehensive Development Zone (KCCDZ).
The KCCDZ, initiated by the maritime ministry in 2021 and included in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, is expected to generate significant employment opportunities, with the feasibility study already complete and implementation planned in three phases across 687 acres.
According to a press statement issued from the CM house, the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) briefed the chief minister on the KCCDZ project, a joint initiative with the federal government through an existing Memorandum of Understanding.

This project, estimated at $3.1bn, aims to reclaim land near Machar Colony for developments, including a business bay, high-tech knowledge park, new industry city, cruise terminal, and a desalination plant. The CM said that the proposed project would not affect any human settlement in the area.
A committee, including the Sindh Planning and Development Minister Syed Nasir Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, and Commissioner Hasan Naqvi, will address land-related issues between the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and the Sindh government. The federal maritime ministry will soon appoint its representatives to the committee.
The meeting included provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Nasir Shah, Muhammad Ali Malkani, Environment Advisor Dost Muhammad Rahimoon, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, P&D Chairman Najm Shah, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi, Environment Secretary Agha Shahnawaz and others.
On the federal side, Parliamentary Secretary for Maritime Affairs Dr Darshan Punshi, Director General Ports & Shipping Alia Shahid, Secretary Board of Investment Dr Arif Iqbal, Chairman Port Qasim Authority Rear Admiral (R) Moazzam Ilyas, General Manager KPT Atiq Rahman and other officials were present.
At the outset of the meeting, the chief minister affirmed Sindh’s commitment to collaborate with the maritime ministry on all upcoming projects, emphasising the need for joint efforts to drive the province’s development.
Sewerage system
Recognising the dire need to prevent untreated wastewater from polluting the sea, the chief minister underscored the importance of rapidly installing sewage treatment plants throughout Karachi.
He extended a standing offer to collaborate on every project with the federal ministry, ensuring synergy and maximising benefits for the people of the province.
The federal maritime affairs minister expressed his confidence that projects undertaken in partnership with the Sindh government would deliver substantial benefits to the province and its residents.
Both the federal and provincial governments concurred on the critical importance of working together to promote sustainable coastal development in Karachi.
Sewage treatment overhaul
The chief minister said that the provincial government was actively installing treatment plant-3 (TP-3) in collaboration with CRBC, alongside plans to establish a desalination plant with a capacity of 50,000 gallons of water daily.
He said that the broader Greater Karachi Sewerage Plan (STP-III) was being expedited to tackle the issue of untreated sewage flowing into the sea via the Lyari and Malir rivers. “Upgrades to treatment plants TP-1 and TP-2 will increase their capacity to 100 MGD and 180 MGD, respectively, while a new treatment plant (TP-4) with a 180 MGD capacity will be constructed in Korangi, specifically treating water from the Malir river basin,” he added.
An eco-tourism project was also discussed to launch, offering boat tours through Karachi’s mangrove areas.
Truck stand
The meeting was told that relocating the truck stand from the city had been assigned to the committee of the Advocate General of Sindh and the Commissioner of Karachi. The KPT representatives would also be in the committee, and they would jointly propose the location for shifting the truck stand and then get approval from the chief minister.

It is located in the Milky Way galaxy about 15,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Scutum, flashing every 44 minutes in both radio waves and X-ray emissions. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
The researchers said it belongs to a class of objects called “long-period radio transients,” known for bright bursts of radio waves that appear every few minutes to several hours. This is much longer than the rapid pulses in radio waves typically detected from pulsars — a type of speedily rotating neutron star, the dense collapsed core of a massive star after its death.
Pulsars appear, as viewed from Earth, to be blinking on and off on timescales of milliseconds to seconds. “What these objects are and how they generate their unusual signals remain a mystery,” said astronomer Ziteng Wang of Curtin University in Australia, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.
In the new study, the researchers used data from Nasa’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, the ASKAP telescope in Australia and other telescopes. While the emission of radio waves from the newly identified object is similar to the approximately 10 other known examples of this class, it is the only one sending out X-rays, according to astrophysicist and study co-author Nanda Rea of the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona.
The researchers have some hypotheses about the nature of this star. They said it may be a magnetar, a spinning neutron star with an extreme magnetic field, or perhaps a white dwarf, a highly compact stellar ember, with a close and quick orbit around a small companion star in what is called a binary system.
“However, neither of them could explain all observational features we saw,” Wang said. Stars with up to eight times the mass of our sun appear destined to end up as a white dwarf. They eventually burn up all the hydrogen they use as fuel. Gravity then causes them to collapse and blow off their outer layers in a  “red giant” stage, eventually leaving behind a compact core roughly the diameter of Earth — the white dwarf.
The observed radio waves potentially could have been generated by the interaction between the white dwarf and the hypothesised companion star, the researchers said.
“The radio brightness of the object varies a lot. We saw no radio emission from the object before November 2023. And in February 2024, we saw it became extremely bright. Fewer than 30 objects in the sky have ever reached such brightness in radio waves. Remarkably, at the same time, we also detected X-ray pulses from the object. We can still detect it in radio, but much fainter,” Wang said. Wang said it is thrilling to see a new type of behavior for stars.
“The X-ray detection came from Nasa’s Chandra space telescope. That part was a lucky break. The telescope was actually pointing at something else, but just happened to catch the source during its ‘crazy’ bright phase.

The committee chair­m­­an, MNA Pullain Ba­­loch, also issued similar directives to Radio Pak­istan and the Shalimar Broad­casting Company, a public limited organisation that operates A-TV channel and FM Radio 94.
The committee was informed that PTV generated an advertising revenue of Rs7.5 billion, surpassing the target of Rs6.19bn in the last financial year.
The target for the current year was likely to be achieved.
The committee was also told the PTV was facing financial constraints as a major chunk of Rs10bn collected as TV fee in electricity bills is spent on salaries and pensions.
Regarding the delay in payment of salaries, the PTV officials told the committee that funds were diverted to pay international financial obligations and acquisition of international media rights.
It resulted in temporary financial constraints, the officials claimed.
The PTV management also presented details of employees who were appointed due to political affiliation and subsequently laid off during the ongoing restructuring.
While taking notice of delay in allotment of plots to journalists in sectors F-14 and F-15 and Barha Kahu in Islamabad, the committee directed the information ministry to scrutinise the applications and redress the grievances of aspirants within the next two months.
The committee members said journalists were facing multitude of issues due to this inordinate delay on the part of the ministry.
The meeting also reviewed the report of a subcommittee chaired by MNA Mahtab Akbar Rashdi on the Pemra (Amendment) Bill, 2025, moved by Asia Naz Tanoli.
The committee direc­ted Pemra to give its views on the subcommittee’s recommendations.
The convener and the mover of the bill separately briefed the committee on the report.

• Finance secretary says legal framework will only be introduced if govt legalises crypto
• Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
ISLAMABAD: Amid growing official promotion of Bitcoin adoption, both the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Thursday said that cryptocurrency remains banned in the country and all its transactions are illegal under current regulations.
During a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that although the prime minister had recently formed a Crypto Council — chaired by the finance minister — through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, a cryptocurrency ban is intact under SBP and SECP regulations.
“There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” Mr Bosal said, conceding that no parliamentary backing exists for cryptocurrency use.
 
 

Mr Bosal also reconfirmed later to journalists that the federal budget would be announced on June 10 and discussions with the International Monetary Fund were ongoing virtually on budget estimates and proposed measures. He said the Asian Development Bank was expected to approve an $800 million loan to Pakistan on June 3.
Committee members expre­ssed confusion over the government’s approach. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig questioned why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto when it remained legally banned, warning that investors could face serious consequences.
Mohammad Mobeen wondered why the government was dealing with the subject of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency instead of the SBP. He stressed that while the government was calling crypto illegal, it had simultaneously allocated power capacity for mining operations.
Further highlighting the policy inconsistency, he pointed out that Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), had been holding meetings with high-profile global leaders.
Shahram Tarakai said the country’s foreign exchange would flow out of the country very soon through cryptos and the government would then be in a fix.
Other members raised questions about whether the crypto mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers.
Sohail Jawad, an executive director of the SBP, said the central bank had issued a directive in 2024, declaring the legal status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, and that stance was still intact.
In fact, the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still referring crypto-related cases to law enforcement agencies for further action, he said.
He said a national working group of digital currency had been established and suggestions had also been given to the Pakistan Crypto Council. He said El Salvador was the only country with legalised cryptocurrency in the world, and even that nation was reconsidering the decision.
The State Bank of Pakistan does not recognise crypto assets, which are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system. The SBP issued a formal notice in 2022 advising the general public to be cautious of and refrain from trading cryptocurrencies.
Need for regulation
The committee discussion on cryptocurrency was triggered by a bill on digital currency regulations proposed by MNA Sharmila Farooqi. She argued that Pakistan needed to regulate crypto to prevent money laundering, especially after its exit from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list.
The Pakistan Crypto Council was officially launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
The debate coincided with the unveiling of the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the newly promoted special assistant to the prime minister on crypto and blockchain.
An official statement released by the Ministry of Finance said the unveiling was held at Las Vegas, United States, at an event for an elite audience that included US Vice President J.D. Vance, and the sons of US President Donald Trump — Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.
“This wasn’t just a policy moment — it was a rebranding of a nation,” the statement said, adding that Mr Saqib conveyed a bold message that Pakistan was no longer defined by its past.
Speaking at the event, Mr Saqib said Pakistan is “being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen.”
He added, “I’m not just here as a minister. I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”
A statement issued by Mr Saqib’s office said that while “other leaders talk about potential, Bilal is unlocking it — with bold national moves that put Pakistan at the centre of the global crypto conversation”.
He also announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin wallet, holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.
He also thanked President Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.

Earlier this week, Aleema Khan, sister of the former prime minister, proposed a ‘give-and-take formula’ for the release of her brother, alleging that “unseen forces” were pressuring judges and inf­luencing legal proceedings against Mr Khan.
“I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said.
On Thursday, however, PTI leader Ali Zafar told media persons after the hearing of a May 9 case in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail that the incarcerated PTI chief said that he would never go for the “give and take formula”.

Fawad Chaudhry meets ex-PM, advises him to ‘simultaneously’ talk to govt as well as establishment

“Khan sahab said that he was willing to talk, but only in the best interest of the country and would not demand any gain or relaxation for himself,” he said.
According to Barrister Zafar, the former premier said if he wanted a favour for himself, he would have gotten it a long time ago.
The PTI lawyer said that Imran Khan was willing to talk to the esta­blishment but only for the country.
Political space
Fawad Chaudhry, who also met Mr Khan on Thursday, told Dawn that during the conversation with the former prime minister, he realised that the ex-PM was not getting “proper and correct” information.
 
 

“It seems that everyone, who manages to meet Khan sahab, tries to get someone appointed or spends time making efforts to get someone removed from the party. I told Khan sahab that there should be some strategy to deal with the situation,” he said.
Mr Chaudhry said that he told Imran Khan that currently the PTI was fighting with the establishment, the government and even with the opposition.
“I also informed (him) that the (PTI) leadership, which is out of jail, is a newcomer, as a majority of them joined the party a few years ago and they are not even aware of the situation,” he said.
The former information minister said he told the ex-premier that it would be undemocratic to stress that the PTI would only talk to the establishment, not with the political parties.
“I suggested that, first of all, we should talk to the opposition to form a joint political alliance and then start talks with the government. I said that we need to talk with the government and the establishment simultaneously because only that is how we can create political space for the PTI,” he said.

During the session, chaired by Junaid Akbar Khan, the PAC also established a new subcommittee to address the matter further. Muneeb Amir Pirzada was appointed as its convener, with Nadeem Abbas, Khawaja Shiraz and Saleem Mandviwalla named as members.
Audit officials highli­g­hted that the Pakistan Post Office Department ope­ned multiple accounts in the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) without pr­o­per aut­h­orisation. While the Fina­nce Divi­sion had approved the opening of three accounts, the Post Office opened two additional ones without approval.
“Despite the audit obje­ctions, no departmental action has been taken so far,” audit officials stated. Communi­cations Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud acknowledged that the Pakistan Post Office was facing significant operational challenges.
However, the committee chair expressed frustration over the lack of coordination between the Finance Division and the department.
“The Finance Division says it never received the request, while the secretary claims it was sent. Where is the disconnect?” asked Mr Akbar.
 
 

The committee has also officially sought a response from the Ministry of Finance.
The session also addressed allegations of illegal hiring within the Post Office.
Audit officials reported that advertisements were issued for 4,252 positions, despite only 3,938 being officially sanctioned.
“Most of the documents submitted by the hired individuals are fake. Jobs were sold, and you’re saying there’s a stay order?” remarked an outraged Mr Akbar.
Senator Afnanullah Khan added, “Those who accepted bribes and those who offered them are both at fault. Legal action should be taken against both.”
The PAC decided to refer the matter to the NAB for investigation.
Misuse of over Rs4bn funds
The committee also took up audit objections concerning the unauthorised use of over Rs4 billion in funds by Pakistan Post.
The committee members questioned how utility bill payments collected from citizens were misappropriated.
“These were public funds submitted by people paying their electricity bills. How can you justify using them for other purposes?” questioned the chairman.
Calling the act akin to “robbery”, PAC members demanded accountability. Khawaja Shiraz Mehmood asked what disciplinary measures had been taken against those responsible.
In response, the communications secretary claimed that internal disciplinary steps had been initiated and emphasised the need for financial reconciliation with the National Bank.
The PAC has summoned officials from the NBP to the next session for further clarification on the matter.

TAJIK President Emomali Rahmon welcomes Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the Palace of the Nation, on Thursday.—APP

DUSHANBE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon on Thursday reviewed bilateral cooperation in different areas, including political, trade, economy, energy, defence, security, and regional connectivity.
During the meeting, they agreed to pursue new avenues for cooperation with a focus on fostering investment opportunities, enhancing educational lin­kages, prompting cultural exchanges, advancing inf­o­rmation technology collaboration and strengthening people-to-people contacts.
Earlier upon his arrival at the Palace of the Nation, the Tajik leader welcomed the premier and his delegation.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Dushanbe at the invitation of government of Taji­kistan to participate in the International High-Level Conference on Glaciers Preservation (ICGP) being held on 29-31 May.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Syed Tariq Fatemi, and senior officials.
Upon arrival at Dush­anbe, the premier was received by his Tajik counterpart Qohir Rasulzoda.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and President Rahmon while holding in-depth and wide-ranging discussions recalled the signing of the historic Strategic Partnership Agreement during the prime minister’s visit to Dushanbe in July 2024, which laid a strong foundation for strengthening bilateral relations and advancing shared interests.
On CASA-1000, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to positioning it as a pivotal project for regional integration. Wel­coming the holding of CASA-1000 Inter-Governmental Coun­cil in Dushanbe on May 15, the PM spoke of the shared commitment to its early operationalisation.
Regarding economic cooperation, the two leaders, while ack­nowledging the untapped potential in bilateral trade, underscored the importance of actively pursuing new avenues of cooperation in line with the decisions taken during the 7th session of Pakistan-Tajikistan Joint Com­mission on Trade, Economic and Scientific Technical Cooperation, held in Islamabad in December.
They agreed to effectively leverage the existing institutional frameworks including 12 Joint Working Groups (JWGs) to enhance collaboration, especial­­ly in oil and gas and energy sectors.
They took note of growing bilateral cooperation in the field of defence and security and reiterated their resolve to boost the same to overcome the common security challenges. They emphasised the need to enhance cooperation in counterterrorism, combating cross-border organised crime and human and drug trafficking.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction on cooperation at the multilateral fora, including at the UN, OIC, SCO and ECO.
PM Shehbaz reiterated
Pakis­tan’s commitment to strengthening connectivity linkages with Central Asia and highlighted China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as a linchpin of Pakistan’s connectivity with the region.
‘Unlawful actions’
He briefed President Rahmon on the latest situation in South Asia. He said the region could not afford India’s irresponsible and unlawful actions since May 7, which amounted to acts of war and violation of the UN Charter and international law.
He also underscored that the resolution of Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, remains fundamental to securing lasting peace.
President Rahmon said that as a staunch friend of Pakistan, he too was very worried at the events of early May, adding that he would always promote peace and stability in the region. He added he was impressed by the prime minister’s remarkable leadership that was critical to the restoration of peace and security in the region.
President Rahmon reaffirmed Tajikistan’s desire for intensifying cooperation in all fields, terming Pakistan as a trusted partner. He underlined the im­portance of closer collaboration in the areas of science and technology, agriculture, industry, hyd­­­ropower generation, and tourism.
The PM extended invitation to President Rahmon for an official visit to Islamabad. President Rahmon also hosted a special reception in honour of Prime Minister Shehbaz.
Azeri investment
Earlier, the PM said Pakistan was ready to receive $2 billion investment from Azerbaijan in multiple sectors.
The prime minister, while talking to Azerbaijan TV prior to his departure from Lachin to Dushanbe, said: “Yesterday, [Azerbaijan’s] President Ilham Aliyev again reiterated his commitment to invest $2 billion in Pakistan. We are ready for this investment for mutual benefits,” he said.

“Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 2025” by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) finds that while direct disaster costs averaged $70 billion to $80bn a year between 1970 and 2000, these figures surged to $180bn to $200bn annually from 2001 to 2020. The growing economic burden highlights the intensifying impact of disasters worldwide.
The “big five” disasters — earthquakes, floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves — have accounted for over 95pc of direct recorded losses over the past 20 years. In 2023 alone, these hazards caused direct economic losses of more than $195.7bn, or about 0.015pc of global GDP. Extreme heat, once overlooked, is now included among these primary hazards due to its role in fatalities, reduced productivity, and lower well-being.
Pakistan’s 2022 floods, which killed more than 1,700 people and caused $30bn in damages, led to substantial impacts on capital markets and the country’s sovereign credit rating. “As climate change intensifies extreme events, future climate-induced rating downgrades may be more likely,” the report said. This poses a growing concern for economies and investors alike, including pension funds, insurers, and central banks that hold sovereign debt.

Warns risk reduction critically underfunded at 2pc of aid

Between 1970 and 2023, geophysical disasters such as earthquakes caused approximately $1.59tr in economic losses. Another $5.18tr in losses came from 24,433 reports of floods, storms, droughts, and extreme heat, with other disasters contributing an additional $100bn.
Despite the overwhelming evidence, only 2pc of development aid is allocated to disaster risk reduction. “Under-estimating the risk of disasters means under-valuing the benefits of risk reduction,” the report says. As populations and development increasingly concentrate in vulnerable areas, the exposure and vulnerability to hazards grow significantly.
Climate-induced school disruptions are also rising. In 2024, at least 242 million students across 85 countries faced school closures due to climate events. Of these, 74pc were in low- and lower-middle-income nations, exacerbating educational inequalities and long-term impacts.
 
 

From 2000 to 2023, earthquakes, extreme heat, storms, floods, and droughts were responsible for 90pc of disaster deaths — with earthquakes alone accounting for half. Since 1900, 12 earthquakes have killed more than 50,000 people each, five of which occurred after 2000.
Water-related hazards dominated from 1970 to 2019, making up 50pc of all disasters and 45pc of disaster-related deaths. Floods have increased by 134pc since 2000, with Asia recording most of the associated deaths and economic losses. The number of people exposed to floods rose from 28.1 million in 1970 to 35.1m in 2020 — a 24.9pc increase.
Droughts are similarly widespread. Between 2007 and 2017, they affected at least 1.5bn people and caused $125bn in losses. Most drought-related deaths since 2000 have occurred in Africa. As of 2025, over 920m children — more than one-third of the global child population — are highly exposed to water scarcity.
“Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector to climate impacts,” the report notes, with 82pc of all drought-related losses between 2008 and 2018 occurring in agriculture in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
Between 1984 and 2023, regions such as central U.S., Argentina, Turkey, northwest India, Pakistan, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia, and parts of Australia experienced the highest frequency of severe agricultural droughts — around 8 to 12 events over the 40-year span. Much of this variation is linked to El Niño and La Niña cycles.

Chaotic US trade policy has sent global markets on a roller coaster in recent months. Equity markets were rattled by Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, which have since been repeatedly delayed and adjusted.
Following a market revolt after the April 2 tariff shock, Trump paused most import duties for 90 days and vowed to hammer out bilateral deals with trade partners.
Markets have swung wildly through Trump’s on-and-off tariff changes. The S&P 500 index is up 4.1% since duties were announced while European stocks have gained 2.0%.
Gold is up 5.9% from April 2, and the dollar index is down 4.4%. Ten-year Treasury yields have climbed 23 basis points to around 4.4%.
But stocks showed little reaction to the appeals court decision, having already pulled back from the rally sparked by Wednesday’s trade court ruling.
Markets have grown accustomed to the president announcing steep tariffs only to postpone them soon afterward, giving rise to the acronym TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out), coined by the Financial Times.
Asked on Wednesday by a reporter for his response to the term TACO, Trump said the question was “nasty” and in his defence of tariff changes, said: “It’s called negotiation.”
“Trump has already rolled back most of these tariffs anyway, so these court rulings are just headlines,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York.
“As far as I’m concerned, as long as the market doesn’t tank on the news, it’s just a secondary byproduct,” Sarhan added.
 
 

Earlier, a federal court blocked most of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, dealing a major setback to the president as he bids to redraw the US trading relationship with the world by forcing governments to the negotiating table through tough new tariffs.
The three-judge Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped his authority, and barred most of the duties announced since he took office in January.
Attorneys for the Trump administration promptly filed an appeal against the ruling, which gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs.
“It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

Justice Aminuddin Khan, who headed the 11-judge bench, remarked that PTI had apparently misled the candidates into joining SIC, which was not even a parliamentary party.
The remarks were made on Thursday as the bench resumed the hearing of a set of review petitions filed against the court’s July 2024 order.
Faisal Siddiqi, who was representing SIC, conceded some “mistakes were committed” by the party, but went on to add that “we all make mistakes”. He remarked that even great judges gave bad judgements in the past.

Justice Hilali asks if eight judges amended Constitution by extending deadline for independents to join parties

Justice Khan observed even if the court accepted the SIC’s contention that this confusion was entirely the Election Commission of Pakistan’s fault, the party has also admitted the wrong it committed.
During the hearing, Justice Hilali wondered whether the majority judgement by eight judges in July 2024 had amended the Constitution by extending the requirement of joining a party after winning the election within 15 days.
She also questioned why the SIC chairman, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who has had a political party since 2013, contested the election as an independent candidate.
“How candidates who in their nomination forms mentioned them as independents were qualified for the rese­r­ved seats since these reserved seats were meant only for the political parties that contested elections and entered the parliament?” the judge questioned.
The PTI never entered the parliament as a party after its members contested elections as independents.
Democratic constitutionalism
Mr Siddiqi, the SIC lawyer, contended the majority judgement addressed all questions being raised by the bench.
He argued that courts have to adhere to the provisions of the Constitution, but those provisions have to be understood in terms of democratic constitutionalism.
“If every judgement has to be democratic, then what will be the impact of the Constitution?” asked Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
He wondered whether the counsel wanted judges to decide cases on the public’s will to save the democratic process even if it went beyond the Constitution.
Mr Siddiqi replied that while looking at the Constitution, one should keep in mind that this was a democratic document and that was why every provision “should enhance democratic norms”.
Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, observed that his reading of the judgment was that the judges expressed their views through certain observations without referring to the facts of the case.
It seemed that with this bias in their mind, the judges proceeded to discuss and concluded the case afterwards.
The counsel agreed that judges have laid the foundations of the judgment in the beginning and decided the case on these principles but disagreed that it amounted to bias.
When the counsel stated that there were certain points in the judgment that had been agreed upon by all 11 judges, Justice Mazhar wondered whether these reviews pertained to all three judgments or to the eight-judge majority judgment.
Justice Khan emphasised only the majority judgment was under review while the other two were intact.
He also said the counsel was “going beyond the scope of the case” before the court.
The counsel said the majority of the judges had agreed that a number of members contested elections as independent but were PTI-affiliated candidates.
Secondly, all 11 judges held that the reserved seats belong to PTI.
He argued that petitioners who filed the reviews cannot argue that PTI was not a party and therefore, cannot be granted relief.
The lawyer added that Justice Mandokhail and former CJP Qazi Faez Isa, in their note, had granted relief to the PTI.
“That is why their argument was self-destructive,” the counsel emphasised and recalled since PTI did not hold intra-party elections, they were not granted the election symbol, which led to “certain consequences” at the time of filing nomination papers.
The counsel argued the ECP, while misreading the decisions of the PHC and Supreme Court, considered PTI candidates as independents when the party was entitled to get 78 reserved seats in the national as well as provincial assemblies.
Since the party could not get reserved seats, PTI members decided to join SIC, the counsel explained.
At this point, Justice Hilali again asked whether SIC had representation in parliament.
The majority of judges in the July 2024 order agreed several candidates in the parliament belonged to PTI but not to SIC. Therefore, they were entitled to reserved seats, the counsel argued.
Meanwhile, the petitioners, PML-N, PPP and the ECP have already filed additional grounds before the bench.

Produced under HRCP’s Legislation Watch Cell, the report’s findings were presented by digital rights activist Farieha Aziz at an advocacy meeting held as part of a European Union-funded project. Introducing the session, HRCP Director Farah Zia noted with alarm the recent wave of repressive laws, particularly those undermining civic spaces and being used to suppress dissent and freedom of expression.
Farieha Aziz, who authored the report, pointed out that Peca criminalised vague categories of “fake and false information,” carrying penalties of up to three years’ imprisonment. It also establishes a powerful regulatory authority, a complaints council and a tribunal — all subject to disproportionate executive control.
Additional concerns include the reclassification of previously bailable and non-cognisable offences into non-bailable and cognisable ones, thereby widening the scope for coercive action.
 
 


Commission’s report claims law contains serious flaws

Moreover, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency has replaced the Federal Investigation Authority, operating without adequate safeguards.
Speaking at the meeting, journalist Adnan Rehmat emphasised the state’s responsibility to protect individuals’ rights, according to a statement issued by the HRCP. He advocated for the decriminalisation of free speech and suggested engaging political parties through broad-based representation.
Journalist Saleem Shahid criticised Peca for allegedly violating constitutional rights to free speech and access to information. He urged journalists and civil society to form a united front to defend these freedoms.
Former BNP-M legislator Sanaullah Baloch underscored that freedom of expression is essential to a strong parliament.
HRCP Co-Chair Munizae Jahangir highlighted the issue of hyper-regulated connectivity in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the pressure faced by journalists operating in these regions and in Azad Kashmir.
 
 

In this context, journalist Asad Ali Toor shared his personal experience of discovering that his family’s bank accounts had been frozen — allegedly in connection with his work — a tactic Munizae Jahangir described as “economic terrorism”.
Digital rights activists Usama Khilji and Aftab Alam called for the formation of a national coalition of civil society members, journalists, and human rights defenders to engage political parties on the rapid escalation of curbs on freedom of expression and opinion.
Supporting the proposal, HRCP council member Farhatullah Babar stressed the need for countering disinformation while simultaneously protecting the broader rights to free speech and access to information.
Concluding the meeting, HRCP Islamabad Vice Chair Nasreen Azhar proposed that the coalition should identify all laws that conflict with constitutional guarantees of fundamental freedoms.

More than 2000 athletes from 43 countries will compete in the 26th edition of the Asian Athletics Championships, set to take place in South Korea, according to the official Olympics website.
In a video message on his Instagram Stories, he said, “I am competing tomorrow in [South] Korea at 6:15am Pakistan Time.”
He said that this was his first tournament following last year’s Olympics. “Please pray for me so that I qualify for the finals,” he said.
“The final would take place on May 31 at 1:10pm PKT,” he said, asking for prayers so that he could “secure the medal and make Pakistan proud”.
In August last year, Nadeem set a new Olympic record and won a gold medal in the men’s javelin final in Paris with a 92.97m throw.

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday night, seven terrorists were killed in operations in the North Waziristan and Chitral districts.
In North Waziristan, “Indian-sponsored khawarij attempted to attack a security forces’ check post in general area Shawal,” the ISPR said, using the state-designated term for terrorists. “The attempt was effectively thwarted by own troops and in [the] ensuing fire exchange, six Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell.
“However, during intense fire exchange, Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail (age: 24 years, resident of District Mardan), a brave young officer who was leading his troops from [the] front, fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his three men,” the ISPR said.
The three other soldiers martyred in the operation were 42-year-old Naib Subedar Kashif Raza from Chakwal district, 35-year-old Lance Naik Fiaqat Ali from Haripur district and 26-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Hameed from Abbottabad district.
In the second encounter in Chitral District, security forces successfully neutralised one “Indian-sponsored kharji”.
Earlier, security forces killed five terrorists linked to “Indian proxy Fitnah-al-Hindustan” in two separate operations in Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
According to a statement issued by ISPR this evening, one of the two engagements was an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Loralai district.
“During the … operation, [our] own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were successfully neutralised,” the ISPR said, adding that weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered.
According to the ISPR, the dead terrorists were involved in numerous terrorist activities, including attacks on the N-70 highway near Rarasham on August 26, 2024, and February 18, 2025, that resulted in the deaths of 30 people.
“The killed Indian-sponsored terrorists were highly wanted by law enforcement agencies, and were relentlessly pursued by the security forces,” the statement added.
In the second engagement in Kech District, one more terrorist was “sent to hell”.
“[The] Security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace [of] Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism and their facilitators to justice,” the ISPR statement concluded.
President Asif Ali Zardari issued a statement from his office paying tribute to security forces for the two operations, reiterating his resolve to eradicate Fitnah-ul-Hindustan.
“Security forces are taking action to eradicate the menace of terrorism and the nation stands united,” he was quoted as saying. “Operations against Fitnah-ul-Hindustan will continue until terrorism is completely eradicated.”
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

The casualties were reported after a series of lightning strikes and structure collapses occurred amid extremely heavy rain.
The spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com, that the casualties were reported in the Mohmand and Mardan districts of the province.
“Two people were killed while one was injured in a lightning strike in Mohmand,” he said. “As soon as the incident was reported, the Rescue 1122 control room took immediate action and dispatched a medical response team to the scene.”
He added that the team took timely action and provided first aid to the injured at the scene and later moved him to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Nawagai.
“The bodies of the two deceased were transported to District Headquarters Hospital Ghalnai after medico-legal formalities,” he added.
“Rescue 1122 medical, fire and disaster teams are performing relief operations,” Faizi said. “Roads are closed in several areas due to falling trees. Rescue 1122 disaster teams and local people are working to clear the roads.”
Providing details of the casualties, Rescue 1122, in a statement, said that in Takht-i-Bahi, a mother and daughter were reported to have died after a ceiling collapsed while a girl was injured, adding that in Katlang Qasmi, a 60-year-old woman was seriously injured, while two children sustained critical wounds in a similar incident at Akhun Baba.
Fifteen-year-old Abdul Salam was seriously injured in a wall collapse on Bakhshali Cham Dheri Road. In Manga, three people were critically hurt in another wall collapse. A 38-year-old woman was injured when a gate collapsed near Jabal Madrasa, and a 40-year-old woman sustained serious injuries in a wall collapse in Rustam Peshkando.
“Rescue 1122 said its medical teams provided first aid to all the injured and transported them to nearby hospitals,” the statement said.
The World Meteorological Organisation forecast that most of South Asia would experience above-normal rainfall and above-average temperatures during this year’s southwest monsoon season from June to September.
Earlier this week, at least three people lost their lives and multiple others were injured as strong winds and thunderstorms lashed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-05-29 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29230229e90651a.jpg?r=230404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914123/switzerland-monitoring-for-flood-risk-after-huge-glacier-collapse' target='_blank'><strong>Switzerland monitoring for flood risk after huge glacier collapse</strong></a><br><p>Swiss authorities on Thursday were monitoring for possible flood risk in a southern valley, following a massive glacier collapse that created a huge pile of debris after destroying a small village.
On Wednesday, the Birch glacier in Switzerland’s southern Valais (Wallis) region collapsed, sending tons of rock, ice and scree hurtling down the mountain slope and into the valley below.
The barrage largely destroyed the hamlet of Blatten, which had been home to 300 people and was evacuated last week due to the impending danger.
One person, a man aged 64, believed to be in the affected zone at the time, remained missing. A police spokesman said the difficult conditions had forced the search for him to be called off on Thursday afternoon.
Authorities declared a local state of emergency on Thursday as they monitor the situation after the huge pile of glacier debris, stretching some two kilometres, blocked the river Lonza.
“There is a serious risk of an ice jam that could flood the valley below,” Antoine Jacquod, a military security official, told the Keystone-ATS news agency. “We’re going to try to assess its dimensions today,” added Jacquod.
Authorities said an assessment would be made at 6pm (9pm PKT) from the nearby village of Ferden as to whether an approach to the zone could be attempted.
As a precaution, 16 people were evacuated late on Wednesday from the villages of Wiler and Kippel located downstream from the disaster area in the Loetschental valley, known for scenic views stretching some 30km and home to around 1,500 people living in traditional villages.

‘Not very stable’
“It’s like a mountain, and of course, it creates a small lake that gets bigger and bigger,” explained Raphael Mayoraz, the cantonal official in charge of natural hazard management, on Wednesday evening.
An artificial dam was preemptively emptied to receive the water pushed back by the wall of ice, earth and rubble. Were that water to overflow from the dam, authorities would need to consider evacuating the valley.
The level is rising 80 centimetres (31 inches) an hour, according to Swiss daily Le Temps.
The huge amount of debris makes the peaks overlooking the valley appear smaller, while a gaping hole can be seen on the side of the mountain from where the land slid down into the valley.
The Valais cantonal government has meanwhile asked the army, which set up a base camp in Turtmann on Wednesday and is readying helicopters for making an approach to the affected zone, to provide clearing equipment and pumps to secure the riverbed.
 
 

“The deposit … is not very stable, and debris flow is possible within the deposit itself [which] makes any intervention in the disaster area impossible for the time being,” cantonal authorities stated, adding there was risk on both sides of the valley.
They also warned of a risk of torrential lava within the debris deposit itself, preventing, for the time being, any intervention in the disaster area.
Seismic event
YouTube footage of the collapse showed a huge cloud of ice and rubble hurtling down the mountainside, into the valley, and partially up the mountain slope on the other side.
The force was such that Swiss monitoring stations registered the phenomenon as a seismic event.
 


According to Mayoraz, “three million cubic metres of rock fell suddenly onto the glacier, carrying it with them” down into the valley.
Warming temperatures have both shrunk the Alps’ glaciers and have made them more unstable.
Swiss glaciers, severely impacted by climate change, melted as much in 2022 and 2023 as between 1960 and 1990, losing in total about 10 per cent of their volume.
In late August 2017, approximately 3.1 million cubic meters of rock fell from Pizzo Cengalo, a mountain in the Alps in Graubuenden canton, near the Italian border, claiming the lives of eight hikers.
Some 500,000 cubic metres of rock and mud flowed as far as the town of Bondo, causing significant material damage but no casualties.</p><small>2025-05-29 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606809-china-lauds-pakistans-responsible-conduct-during-standoff-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>China lauds Pakistan's ‘responsible conduct' during standoff with India</strong></a><br><p>

The remarks came as the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB) heard review pleas against a ruling that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats.
In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had dismissed the review petitions on the first day of hearings.
The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
The CB live-streamed its proceedings on the SC’s YouTube channel, after accepting the SIC’s application for it last week.
 


Advocate Faisal Siddiqui appeared before the court today on behalf of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which the PTI-backed independent candidates had joined during the 2024 elections after the PTI’s election symbol was revoked.
Sikandar Bashir Mohmand was present as the ECP counsel while Barrister Haris Azmat appeared as the PML-N lawyer.
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail noted that he and ex-CJP Isa, in their minority judgement, had agreed with the eight-judge majority verdict to the extent of 39 candidates. He further said that CJP Yahya Afridi had also acknowledged the PTI’s right to reserved seats.
Despite the 8-5 split, 11 out of the 13 judges had declared the PTI a parliamentary party. In his standalone order, Justice Afridi had ordered the ECP to provide an opportunity to the parties concerned about the reserved seats and, if required, to revisit its earlier decision within seven days.
Justice Mazhar, a part of the original majority verdict, also noted: “The minority judges acknowledged the PTI on the same grounds as the majority judges.”
 
 

The proceedings were then adjourned till 11:30am on June 16, with Siddiqi set to continue his arguments.
During the previous hearings, the CB had questioned the SIC’s standing in the case, noting that the original order had allocated seats to the PTI and not the SIC. Senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan, counsel for women lawmakers affected by the SC ruling, has also contested the legality of that verdict.
Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.
Justice Ayesha had formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.
In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked the PML-N lawyer whether he had addressed the point of a party’s candidates being declared as independent in his written response. Azmat replied that he had tried to answer the question.

Siddiqi contended that the Supreme Court Rules had not been considered in some petitions and asked that those be dismissed.
He said he would answer the question of why SIC chairman Hamid Raza contested the elections independently, at which Justice Mandokhail noted that the matter of “who contested in what manner” was not before the court.
However, Justice Hilali, referring to her questions in previous hearings, remarked: “I had some questions, which I did not get a satisfactory answer to.”
She noted that the SIC had existed as a political party since 2013, wondering how it was “made a parliamentary party” despite Raza not contesting the polls from his party.
“It was stated in the reserved seats case that voting is a fundamental right, even though voting is not a fundamental right,” Justice Hilali said.
 
 

Here, Justice Mandokhail recalled that he and ex-CJP Justice Qazi Faez Isa, in their minority judgement, agreed with the eight-judge majority verdict to the extent of 39 candidates.
“Justice Yahya Afridi also said that the PTI had a right to reserved seats,” the judge added. In his standalone order, Justice Afridi had ordered the ECP to provide an opportunity to the parties concerned about the reserved seats and, if required, to revisit its earlier decision within seven days.
Justice Mazhar, a part of the original majority verdict, observed, “The minority judges acknowledged the PTI on the same grounds as the majority judges.”
Siddiqi then questioned how the review applications could depend on the minority rulings, pointing out that the same judgements had “accepted the PTI as a party”.
Justice Panhwar noted, “The verdict challenged by those who brought the review petitions had not even been read before us.”
Justice Mazhar questioned whether judges could decide outside the constitutional scope. “Even if for the public aspiration and democracy, can judges rewrite the Constitution?”
Siddiqi responded that the Constitution had not been rewritten, at which Justice Hilali observed that it had been. “Three days’ period was extended to 15 days,” she said, referring to the time given to 41 independent candidates to resubmit their party affiliation.
Upon the lawyer contending that the majority of the judges were in favour of the PTI getting the reserved seats, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “You are creating issues for yourself.”
Siddiqi then replied, “We have no issue whether the PTI gets the reserved seats or the SIC; it is the same.”
The lawyer argued, “Everyone should get equal rights. PTI candidates were deliberately not given their rights.”
 
 

Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “Democracy has been mentioned. Is it not democracy for the candidates to decide on their own? No one can be forced to join another party. Those independent candidates who want to join another party can do so.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin addressed Siddiqi, saying: “You keep going to the past.” The lawyer responded that the original ruling had not been read aloud before the bench, at which Justice Mandokhail asked why he was complaining when no one had stopped him from reading it.
At one point, Justice Hilali again questioned the SIC’s role in the conundrum.
Addressing Siddiqi, she asked: “Why did you (SIC) not tell the PTI that ‘we are not contesting the elections’? The SIC chairman should have informed the PTI that he is running in the elections independently.”
Referring to the dissenting order by Justice Aminuddin and Justice Afghan that had denied the PTI reserved seats, the lawyer stated, “I do not agree with Justice Aminuddin’s judgement but it was a very forceful decision.”
At one point, Justice Mazhar, Justice Hilali and Siddiqi went back and forth over the right to vote being a fundamental constitutional right.
Siddiqi cited Articles 17 and 19 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to affiliation and speech, respectively.
When Justice Hilali asserted that voting was not a fundamental right by birth but created by the statute, Siddiqi explained that there were three types of rights — “natural such as the right to life, given by the statute and fundamental that can only be taken away after a Constitutional Amendment”.
As the hearing was adjourned till June 16, Siddiqi said he would want two hearings to complete his arguments.</p><small>2025-05-29 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29210832bad9ecb.gif?r=220131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914115/karachi-temperatures-expected-to-hit-40c-over-next-3-days-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi temperatures expected to hit 40°C over next 3 days: Met Office</strong></a><br><p>Temperatures in Karachi are expected to soar over the next three days, ranging between 37°C and 41°C, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Thursday, adding that hot and dry weather is also likely to prevail across most parts of Sindh.
The forecast suggested that the minimum temperature in the city will hover between 29°C and 31°C.
Humidity levels are expected to rise by May 31, reaching around 55 per cent in the evening, while winds will predominantly blow from the west and southwest.
The Met Office added that isolated areas in Badin and Tharparkar districts may experience dust and thunderstorms or light rain today.
Climate change is a pressing reality for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.
A day earlier, the United Nations warned that there is a 70pc chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 would exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius international benchmark.
The planet is, therefore, expected to remain at historic levels of warming after the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024, according to an annual climate report published by the World Meteorological Organisation, the UN’s weather and climate agency.
On Monday, a young man died from heatstroke in Kunri town as extreme heat paralyzed life in Sindh’s Umerkot district, with temperatures soaring to 46°C with 52°C “feel”. The prolonged power outages and water shortages have further aggravated the situation for people.
The extreme heat the arid region is witnessing these days has equally affected wildlife with dozens of peacocks and livestock, including goats and cows, reported dead from scorching heat and thirst.</p><small>2025-05-29 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606805-five-india-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-two-balochistan-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Four soldiers martyred, 12 terrorists killed in KP, Balochistan operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Dr Jamshed Marri, dispensary of Sibi Teaching Hospital, told Dawn.com, “As soon as information was received that a Daewoo bus travelling from Sadiqabad to Quetta lost control due to high speed and overturned, Kachhi Levies, Highway Police, and rescue teams immediately reached the spot and started rescue operations.”
The bodies of the deceased and the injured were taken to the Sibi Teaching Hospital, while four critically injured passengers have been moved to Quetta for better medical facilities.
Dr Marri noted that the injured included the bus driver and the conductor.
Police said that according to initial investigations, the cause of the accident appeared to be speeding. However, further investigation into the incident was underway.
Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind expressed grief over the accident and said that the government expresses its condolences to the families of the deceased and prays for the speedy recovery of the injured.
He assured that all possible help would be provided to the affected people.
In 2021, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed that 5,608 people lost their lives in road accidents across Pakistan.
More specifically, an alarming increase in road accidents has been registered in cities such as Karachi where 500 people were killed while 4,879 were injured in 2024 due to a host of reasons ranging from reckless driving to construction activities, according to hospital data.</p><small>2025-05-29 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2918210288490a6.jpg?r=182143' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914098/pm-shehbaz-to-announce-new-tariff-policy-to-make-industries-more-competitive-awais-leghari' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to announce new tariff policy to make industries more competitive: Awais Leghari</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Power Division and Energy Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari on Thursday said that a new tariff policy — expected to make industries more competitive — is to be announced soon by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz approved a comprehensive five-year tariff reform plan to be announced in the federal budget 2025-26, aiming to drastically reduce customs duties, additional customs duties, regulatory duties on raw materials and semi-finished goods, and a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
Consequently, the premier constituted a high-powered steering committee to implement the five-year National Tariff Policy, ensure its effectiveness, monitor macroeconomic indicators related to tariffs, and develop a strong narrative to attract foreign investment and generate industrial surpluses for export.
Addressing an energy workshop in Islamabad today, the federal minister said, “The government has reduced power price for industries by over 30 per cent in the past year.”
The minister mentioned the plan to privatise power distribution companies, adding that the decrease in their losses was encouraging.
He said the government was focusing on renewable energy and that it has shut down 3,000 megawatts of furnace oil-based plants in the past few months.
Leghari said that twenty-seven thousand agriculture tube wells in Balochistan will be shifted to solar power in the next two to three months.</p><small>2025-05-29 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29195911291465c.jpg?r=200148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914110/seduction-course-filming-sparks-spain-arrest' target='_blank'><strong>‘Seduction’ course filming sparks Spain arrest</strong></a><br><p>Police said on Thursday that they arrested a man in Barcelona accused of secretly filming his conversations with women in the street and using the footage to promote an online “seduction technique course”.
Officers allegedly found 239 secretly recorded videos on the suspect’s social media profile in which women shared personal details, such as their nationality, occupation or daily routine.
The suspect, who is believed to have used a hidden camera, approached women on the streets of Barcelona and filmed conversations with them without consent, Spain’s National Police said.
“He is suspected of involvement in offences against privacy and sexual assault,” the statement read.
The footage often showed the women’s faces clearly and was used as promotional material on the suspect’s website, where users could pay €3,000 ($3,400) to enrol for an online “seduction techniques” course and access the secret recordings.
The course’s content included both theoretical instructions on how to approach women and real-life examples based on the videos he had recorded, police said.
Police began their investigation in April after a woman reported the man had touched her inappropriately and tried “to kiss her twice” in the course of a conversation.
She later discovered a video of the incident posted on a popular social media platform, where it had already garnered more than 700,000 views.
Police arrested the suspect in May and he has been released under judicial supervision while awaiting trial, a police spokesman said.</p><small>2025-05-29 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606794-mercury-likely-to-cross-40c-in-karachi-tomorrow-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Mercury likely to cross 40°C in Karachi today: Met Office</strong></a><br><p>

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not recognise crypto assets, which are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system. The SBP issued a formal notice in 2022 advising the general public to be cautious of and refrain from trading cryptocurrencies.
During today’s meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations, prompting different remarks from committee members.
“There are no regulations for cryptocurrency,” Farooqui said, adding that since Pakistan was moving towards digital currency, cryptocurrency should be decentralised.
She highlighted Pakistan’s exit from the ‘grey list’ of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog — and said, “How will Pakistan protect cryptocurrency from money laundering?”
 
 

In 2018, Pakistan was placed on the so-called ’grey list’ for allegedly failing to take adequate measures to curb terror financing and money laundering. The country was removed from the list in 2022.
While highlighting the SBP’s ban on crypto investment, Bosal said, “Preliminary work is underway in the Crypto Council but there is a need for proper regulations for cryptocurrency.”
The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was officially launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to SBP official Sohail Jawad, there was a legal framework required for cryptocurrency. “The National Working Group on Digital Currency has been established, while suggestions have been given to the Crypto Council,” he said.
“Only El Salvador has legalised cryptocurrency in the world, and now they are reversing this decision,” he added.
Meanwhile, committee member Osama Ahmed said, “There is no ban on holding cryptocurrency in Pakistan.”
He said that cryptocurrency was being used to order vehicles from Japan, adding, “Has the State Bank taken any action on this?” He asked, “Is the government supervising the mining of cryptocurrency?”
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig noted the youth were investing in cryptocurrency.
“The value of cryptocurrency is increasing due to government measures, so the government should clearly state whether cryptocurrency is legal or not,” he stressed.
The finance secretary said that while the Crypto Council was established through the executive approval of the prime minister, it had not yet received legal approval.
“The Council must address the concerns raised in the meeting today,” he said.
Earlier today, PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
 
 

In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.
He also revealed that the government had allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in the first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.
Speaking on this development, Baig said that the government had set the electricity rate for crypto mining at seven to eight cents while Pakistan’s industries were demanding nine cents per unit.
“Why doesn’t the government provide electricity to industries at nine cents?” he remarked, saying, “Our exports can increase if industries are provided with electricity at this rate. The government should provide electricity to residential consumers at this rate.”
Farooqui added, “How was the decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity [for crypto mining] made?”
She also asked whether the government conducted a detailed review of this decision, saying, “Pakistan itself is suffering from load shedding.”
Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal.  However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.
In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p><small>2025-05-29 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606816-maharaja-of-kashmir-claims-immunity-in-pakistan-high-commission-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>'Maharaja of Kashmir' claims immunity in Pakistan High Commission attack case</strong></a><br><p>

Thomas Barrack raised the American flag over the ambassador’s residence for the first time since the US embassy closed in 2012, underlining a rapid expansion of US ties with Damascus since President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced the lifting of sanctions and met Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.
“Syria and Israel are a solvable problem. But it starts with a dialogue,” Barrack told a small group of journalists in Damascus. “I’d say we need to start with just a non-aggression agreement, talk about boundaries and borders,” he said.
Barrack also said that Syria would no longer be deemed a state sponsor of terrorism by the United States, saying the issue was “gone with the Assad regime being finished”, but that Congress had a six-month review period.
“America’s intent and the president’s vision is that we have to give this young government a chance by not interfering, not demanding, by not giving conditions, by not imposing our culture on your culture,” Barrack said.
 
 

Interim President Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander, is rapidly reorienting a country that had turbulent ties with the West and close relations with Iran and Russia during more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.
Syria has long been a frontline state in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with Israel occupying the Syrian Golan Heights since a war in 1967. Israel seized more Syrian territory in the border zone following Bashar al-Assad’s ouster in December, citing concerns about the jihadist roots of Syria’s new rulers.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Israeli and Syrian officials were in direct contact, having held face-to-face meetings aimed at calming tensions and preventing conflict in the border region.
Trump urged Sharaa to normalise relations with Israel when they met in Riyadh earlier this month.
Barrack, who is also the US ambassador to Turkey, was named as Syria’s US envoy on May 23.
He noted Syria had been under US sanctions since 1979. Some of the toughest were implemented in 2020 under the so-called Caesar act, which Barrack said must be repealed by Congress within a 180-day window.
“I promise you the one person who has less patience with these sanctions than all of you is President Trump,” he said.
The US closed its embassy in Damascus in February 2012, nearly a year after protests against Assad devolved into a violent conflict that went on to ravage Syria for more than a decade.
Then-ambassador Robert Ford was pulled out of Syria shortly before the embassy closed. Subsequent US envoys for Syria operated from abroad and did not visit Damascus.
During Syria’s 14-year war, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, millions were displaced both internally and outside the country and the West ratcheted up pressure against Assad by cutting ties and imposing tough sanctions, but he clung to power with help from Iran and Russia.
Sharaa led al Qaeda’s official wing in Syria for years until severing ties with the global terrorist network in 2016.</p><small>2025-05-29 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606789-pm-shehbaz-reaches-tajikistan-on-two-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Tajikistan vow to elevate strategic cooperation to new level</strong></a><br><p>

Amid media reports claiming that the budget had once again been rescheduled due to the Eidul Azha holidays, Schehzad wrote on X today that no decision has been made to postpone or reschedule the budget.
“As communicated earlier, the upcoming Federal Budget FY26 is on schedule to be announced on June 10, 2025,” he wrote. “Similarly, the upcoming Pakistan Economic Survey FY25 is scheduled to be announced on June 9, 2025.”
 






Additionally, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal told reporters that there was no change in the budget date.
“The federal budget will be presented on June 10,” he told the media after exiting a committee meeting at the National Assembly.
According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), Eidul Azha is expected to fall on June 7, which means the third day of Eid will likely fall on June 9 — the same day the Economic Survey is due to be released.
Last week, Schehzad announced on X that the federal budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.
Before that, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal announced that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p><small>2025-05-29 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/291712154a5661c.jpg?r=171741' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914092/pm-shehbaz-touches-down-in-tajikistan-to-cap-off-four-nation-tour' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz touches down in Tajikistan to cap off four-nation tour</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday landed in Tajikistan as he continues his four-nation tour of friendly countries.
Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent military escalation with India.
Yesterday, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the PM arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe today for his two-day visit, being received by Tajik PM Kokhir Rasulzoda at the airport.
“Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the prime minister,” PTV News reported.
 






During his two-day visit, the PM is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, in which the PM will discuss “cooperation between Pakistan and Tajikistan in various fields … and will thank the Tajik President for Tajikistan’s strong support … during the recent tensions between India and Pakistan,” the broadcaster added.
According to PTV News, the PM will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation during his visit, where he is expected to brief participants on Pakistan’s struggle against climate change and efforts to preserve glaciers.</p><small>2025-05-29 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606759-vendor-displaying-sacrificial-animals-to-attract-the-customers-at-peshawars-ring-road-cattle-market-on-june-6-2024-app' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh issues code of conduct for Eid ul Adha hides collection</strong></a><br><p>
