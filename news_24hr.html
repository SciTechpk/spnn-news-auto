Addressing a press conference in Quetta alongside other top officials, the chief minister said: “On August 14, the suicide bombers were to target those innocent citizens who were celebrating Independence Day.”
He commended the security agencies, the Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department, and the police for saving the province from “huge destruction”.
 


CM Bugti then aired a recorded statement of an arrested man, who said he had done a Master’s from Quaid-i-Azam University and a PhD from Peshawar University, and was working as an 18th Grade lecturer. The man said his wife was also a government employee.
After the video statement aired, CM Bugti noted that the information shared was “not in great detail”, so that ongoing investigations were not affected.
He recalled the Nov 2024 Quetta Railway Station bombing, in which “32 precious lives were lost and 50+ were injured”, and explained how the arrested lecturer was allegedly involved in facilitating the attack.
“He (the lecturer) had him sit on a motorcycle and dropped him near the railway station, and after that, handed him over to another handler about 1 kilometre away from the railway station,” Bugti said.
Stating that the Balochistan militancy issue was attributed by some to “them being deprived”, the chief minister asked rhetorically: “How are these people deprived?
“The mother is still receiving a pension which means she was a government employee, his wife is also a government employee, he himself is a Grade 18 [officer], has studied and done a PhD on Pakistani scholarship, brother is an employee in Reko Diq [project], which means he was not deprived iin any way,” Bugti added.
‘I went against the law and betrayed the state’
In his statement, the lecturer detailed that he got introduced to three men affiliated with “an organisation” during his 2020 visit to Quaid-i-Azam University, and that two of them were later killed. The lecturer said two men, Dr Habetan and Feh Khaliq, then got him to join the militant group and had him meet with Basheerzai.
“All these introductions were made through Telegram,” the man said, referring to a messaging app known for privacy features like secret chats, self-destructing messages, and anonymity. He said he facilitated “three acts” on the group’s directives when he went to Quetta, adding that his alias in the organisation was Feh Hameer.
Recalling how he assisted the group as told by Dr Habetan and Feh Khaliq, the lecturer said he provided a place to a militant who got injured in a clash in Kalat. “I handed him [to another person] before the incident, and the next day, he died in the railway suicide bombing here,” he said.
He then recounted another similar incident, where the man he gave shelter to for seven to eight days was “about to be used in some event of August 14”. The lecturer also confessed to having bought a pistol that was used “in targeting security forces and government employees”.
The lecturer said: “These are the acts I have done, the facilitation I have done. If it’s considered, the state has given us everything — respect, pride, a job — and even to my wife, but despite this, I went against the law and betrayed the state.
“I am deeply ashamed that I remained involved in these actions and regret it, and the aim of this video is that the coming generations, youth, students here save themselves from these groups spreading anarchy,” he added.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that the latest cases involve a six-year-old girl from Union Council Pattan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohistan district, and a 21-month-old girl from Union Council Matli-2 in Badin district.
“With these detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 21, including 13 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement said.
Polio was a highly infectious and incurable disease that could cause lifelong paralysis.  The only effective protection against the debilitating virus is through the repeated administration of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, alongside timely completion of all routine immunisations, the statement said.
It added that from September 1 to 7, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign will take place, targeting more than 28 million children under the age of five in 99 districts across all provinces and regions.
“The campaign in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be conducted from 15 September. The goal is to ensure every child in these districts receives the vaccine to protect them from the lifelong consequences of polio,” it said.
It added that the campaign was part of the ongoing efforts to quickly strengthen immunity among children and close existing protection gaps.
“Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to ensure their children receive the polio vaccine during this and every campaign.”
Last week, poliovirus was found in 36pc samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.</p><small>2025-08-18 06:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619313-fresh-monsoon-spell-lashes-kp-punjab-as-pakistans-rain-death-toll-surpasses-650' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh monsoon spell lashes KP, Punjab as Pakistan's rain death toll surpasses 650</strong></a><br><p>

Of the total destroyed schools, 52 are government primary schools, seven middle and two high schools, according to official data.
Officials in education department told Dawn that the damage to buildings of schools would surge as more reports of destroyed schools were in pipeline. Dir Lower has recorded 17 destroyed government primary schools, the highest number, due to heavy rains and flash floods, followed by Shangla with eight destroyed primary schools.
In Haripur, the buildings of seven schools collapsed including five primary and one each middle and high schools.

Official says alternate arrangements to be made for imparting education to students

Similarly, the buildings of eight primary and two middle schools were destroyed in Mohmand tribal district, five in Battagram including four primary and one middle, four in Abbottabad including two primary and one each middle and high and two primary schools and one middle were destroyed in Swat, two in Mansehra and one each in Buner and Chitral Upper.
The devastating rains and floods have also partially damaged the buildings of 414 government schools including 319 primary, 36 middle, 43 high and 16 higher secondary in the affected areas of the province.
Of the total partially damaged schools, 122 are situated in Swat including 88 primary, 13 middle, 13 high and eight higher secondary, 67 in Abbottabad including 52 primary, seven middle, six high and two higher secondary, 72 in Shangla including 55 primary, six middle, nine higher and three higher secondary and 69 in Dir Lower including 68 primary and one middle.

Likewise, 29 schools have been damaged in Haripur including 27 primary and one each middle and high, 17 in Buner including six primary, four middle, five high and two higher secondary, 12 in Mohmand including six primary, two middle and four higher schools and nine in Battagram including four primary, three middle and two high schools.
The catastrophe has also partially damaged eight schools in Mansehra out of which five are primary, two middle and one high, three primary schools in Dir Upper and one primary school in Bajuar.
The official data also revealed the four teachers and one non-teaching staff were killed due to rains and floods in Buner while three other teachers were injured. The data shows that four students were killed in the disaster.
“We will continue students’ education by all means,” the secretary of elementary and secondary education department, Mohammad Khalid, told Dawn when asked as to how they would impart education to students enrolled in the destroyed schools.
He said that they would opt for establishment of pre-fabricated schools to save time as such structures could be established within one or two months.
“The department has already planned establishment of 50 pre-fabricated schools in different parts of the province. We will change the plan and set up such schools in flood-affected areas,” he said.
An official of elementary and secondary education department told Dawn that the infrastructure of government schools was present in each village and neighbourhood council, that’s why education department faced huge losses in natural and manmade disasters.
“Hundreds of government schools had been destroyed in the devastating earthquake in 2005 in Hazara division. Provincial government reconstructed a large number of those schools but still many could not be rebuilt owing to inefficiency of Federal Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Erra) and Provincial Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Perra),” he said.
The infrastructure of education department was also severely affected during war against terrorism as many government schools were bombed by terrorists. Some schools were also destroyed by the devastating floods in 2010 in the province.

The Baein and Auj drains at the river Ravi have started overflowing, and hundreds of acres of land have been submerged. Land erosion is being reported near Chak Jamil, Fatehpur, Shahpur and Chanjhora villages due to the floodwater. Water level in Ravi has risen from 12,000 cusecs to 51,400 cusecs.
Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 rescued 68 people trapped in the floodwater due to flooding in the rain drain flowing into the Shakargarh tehsil. Of these, eight citizens were trapped near village Dinpur and 60 were rescued near village Sikmal. The local administration has setup 15 flood relief camps on the banks of River and its rainwater drains.
Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza said that the situation on the banks of Ravi and its rain drains was under control. He said that all the departments of the district administration were on high alert.

68 people trapped in floodwater rescued near Shakargarh tehsil

The river Sutlej is experiencing a low to mid-level flood and dozens of villages near the Baba Farid Bridge protective embankment on the Pakpattan-Minchanabad Road are at risk of flooding.
 
 

Local villagers report land erosion at the embankment on the river’s right bank. Villages in Pakpattan and Minchanabad tehsil of Bahawalnagar are at risk of flooding. Locals fear the floodwater could damage surrounding villages, including Malik Bahwal, Mir Khan, Shahou Moor, Naveed Khan Goun and water could also reach the shrine of Chan Pir in Pakpattan. Pakpattan Assistant Commissioner Rab Dino Maitlo told Dawn via phone that the situation in Pakpattan was under control.
However, villagers near Baba Farid Bridge have reportedly begun reinforcing the embankment on a self-help basis. Meanwhile, local administration has set up eight flood relief camps in the area and Rescue 1122 personnel are advising villagers to relocate along with their livestock to safer areas.
At Head Sulemanki on Sutlej, water flow has risen to 60,000 cusecs after a flow of 2,0000 cusecs in the last 24 hours. Okara Deputy Commissioner Ahmad Usman Javed and District Police Officer Muhammad Rashid Hidayat visited Head Sulemanki to gauge the situation.
They were told that relief camps had been established and officials of health, livestock and Rescue 1122 were performing their duties. The camps had been stocked with medicines and food, and cattle fodder had also been arranged at the camps. Announcements were being made from local mosques at localities on the banks of the river to vacate the area.
At Taunsa Barrage, Dera Ghazi Khan the inflow of water in Indus was recorded at 420,000 cusecs while the outflow was 417,000 cusecs on Sunday morning. Populations from low-lying riverine areas have been evacuated and flood relief camps have been established.
Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Ashfaq Ahmed Chaudhry chaired a meeting to review the situation. The meeting was informed that two major spells of rain were expected by August 23, which could increase the water levels in the river and could also cause hill torrents. The commissioner said the situation was under control and all departments were on high alert. The commissioner directed deputy commissioners and relevant officials to ensure availability of de-watering machines to deal with possible urban flooding.
He further directed to ensure availability of livestock vaccination, fodder, and anti-snakebite vaccines. Strict enforcement of the ban on boating and swimming in rivers and streams was also ordered, with mandatory use of life jackets for emergency boatmen.

Cambridge University Press said tradwife, a portmanteau of traditional wife, reflected “a growing, controversial Instagram and TikTok trend that embraces traditional gender roles”.
The dictionary also took on the challenge of defining skibidi, a word popularised in online memes, as a term which had “different meanings, such as cool or bad, or can be used with no real meaning”.
The gibberish word was spread by a YouTube channel called “Skibidi Toilet” and is associated with the mindless, “brain rot” content found on social media and consumed by Gen Alpha’s overwhelmingly digital lifestyle.
The dictionary defined delulu, derived from the word delusional, as “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.
As an example, it cited a 2025 speech in parliament where Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used the phrase “delulu with no solulu”.
 


“It’s not every day you get to see words like skibidi and delulu make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, Lexical Programme manager at the Cambridge Dictionary.
“We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power. Internet culture is changing the English language, and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the Dictionary.”
Other new phrases include “lewk”, used to describe a unique fashion look and popularised by RuPaul’s Drag Race, and “inspo”, short for inspiration.
Work from home culture has given rise to “mouse jiggler”, referring to a way to pretend to work when you are not.
There is also “forever chemical”, man-made chemicals that stay in the environment for years and have gained traction as concerns grow about the irreversible impact of climate change on the health of humans and the planet.</p><small>2025-08-18 06:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18110036742674d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931544/14-punjab-youths-booked-for-harassing-torturing-family-in-lasani-express' target='_blank'><strong>14 Punjab youths booked for harassing, torturing family in Lasani Express</strong></a><br><p>NAROWAL: Pakistan Railway police have registered a case against 14 unidentified youths for harassing and torturing a woman and her children aboard the Lasani Express.
A complaint registered with the Lahore Pakistan Railway police, Razia Sultan, resident of Fateh Ali Colony of Narowal, said that she boarded the Lasani Express passenger train with her daughters and son to travel to Narowal from Lahore. She alleged that two boys, aged between 20 and 22, started harassing her daughters. She said that when she and her son tried to stop them from molesting her daughters, they attacked her son. She said other passengers intervened and saved her son.
However, she alleged that as soon as the train stopped at the Narang Mandi railway station, around 10 to 12 boys came and attacked her and her children. She said that they punched and kicked them and they were helpless because of the sudden attack. She said that on hearing their screams, passengers in the train rescued them from the youths. 
An FIR was registered against 14 unknown boys on the complaint of the woman in Lahore. 
Eyewitness passengers Muhammad Kamal and Azeem Akhtar said these young men board the passenger train daily from Narang Mandi, Kala Khatai and Sri Rampur railway stations. They claimed that this was not the first incident of harassment of girls, women and families. 
They alleged that these group travel without tickets and Railways personnel and police were also afraid of them. 
They said that these youths worked at various factories and shops in Lahore and they routinely abuse travellers in passenger trains between Lahore and Narowal. 
Passengers Abdul Shakoor and Farhan Ali said the trains were overloaded and families and female students were not safe from these unruly youth. 
They claimed that these young men occupy seats without tickets, refuse to vacate them for families and routinely misbehave and abuse passengers. 
They said the Pakistan Railways had failed to provide safe travel facilities to passengers, especially female students and families. 
They said that after a video of a young man abusing women in the Lasani Express went viral on social media, female passengers and families were now scared to travel in the train. 
Citizens and passengers have demanded that Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif take immediate notice of this situation.

Speaking at the inaugural African Political Parties Summit in Ghana, which was attended by more than 200 delegates from over 40 countries, Mr Mushahid emphasised that Nelson Mandela’s approach provides a blueprint for political stability and inclusive governance.
The senator participated as co-chairman of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) and president of PAIDAR, Pakistan’s first think tank focused on Africa, his office said in a statement on Sunday.
Drawing on his personal interactions with Mandela, Mr Mushahid said he was convinced that the South African leader’s legacy was rooted in forgiveness, generosity, and a refusal to be shackled by vengeance.

Highlights revolutionary leader’s legacy of forgiveness, generosity, and voluntary transfer of power after one presidential term

“The Mandela Model rejects politics of vendetta and victimisation, which only trap societies in the past,” he noted.
He added that Mandela championed inclusive, institutional democracy by treating public office as a public trust, and set a historic precedent by stepping down voluntarily after single elected term as president.
“Most of Asia and Africa suffers from power-hungry politicians,” Mr Mushahid regretted.
 






Palestine and Kashmir
He also highlighted Mandela’s unwavering support for the causes of self-determination in Palestine and Kashmir, describing him as a principled statesman who stood by oppressed peoples.
During his visit, the senator met Ghana’s Vice President Jane Naana, Chief of Staff Julius Debrah, and Ethiopia’s Deputy Prime Minister Ebrahim Farah, among other leaders. He also paid tribute at the mausoleum of Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, whom he hailed as a pioneer of Pan-African unity and non-alignment.
In Accra, Mr Mushahid addressed a Pakistan Day gathering, interacted with African think tanks, media, and business leaders, and expressed hope for stronger Pakistan-Africa ties in diplomacy, trade, investment, education, IT, and cooperation on mining and critical minerals.

On the other hand, several major roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Highway, Ghizer–Shandur Road, and Naltar Highway, along with various link roads, remained blocked, leaving thousands of people, including tourists, stranded.
Local residents faced acute shortages of drinking water, prolonged power outages, and disruption of mobile and internet connectivity in several areas.
In Gilgit city, residents held protest demonstrations, blocking main roads against the prolonged water and electricity crisis. They said locals had been without basic utilities for several days.
‘Ministers to supervise KP relief ops’
In the wake of recent destructive rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed federal ministers to supervise relief operations in the province.
 
 

“On the prime minister’s directives, federal ministers will participate in relief operations in the flood-hit districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” said an official statement from the PM Office.
As per the instructions, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam will oversee relief distribution in Shangla and Buner; the Federal Minister for Power Division will assist in Buner; Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf will supervise operations in Mansehra; and the PM’s Special Assistant Mubarak Zeb will oversee aid distribution in Bajaur.
The prime minister is personally overseeing NDMA’s relief operations across all flood-affected districts of KP.
Under the PM’s Relief Package, more truckloads of supplies are being dispatched to the affected districts. The relief goods include food rations, tents, and medicines, which are being handed over to the respective district administrations.
Water levels in rivers
Meanwhile, the PDMA Punjab reported that the River Sutlej continued to experience fluctuating water levels, with a low-level flood situation at Ganda Singhwala and Sulemanki.
The authority said that the current water flow stands at 70,000 cusecs at Ganda Singhwala and 74,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with authorities closely monitoring the situation due to ongoing fluctuations.
The Sutlej River is expected to remain at low to medium flood levels in the coming days, with flows ranging between 75,000 to 85,000 cusecs.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that water flows exceeding 80,000 cusecs could trigger low-level flooding in the Sutlej, while 120,000 cusecs may lead to moderate flooding, and 175,000 cusecs could cause high-level flooding.
The PDMA has also forecast severe monsoon rains in most districts of Punjab, with the seventh spell of monsoon rains expected to continue until August 22/23.

A spokesperson for the FIA in Balochistan said on Sunday that the accused, Abdul Malik, was detained near the Chaman Passport Office while accepting extra payments from people in exchange for expedited passport services.
“Authorities recovered 13 Pakistani passports, 51 tokens, 48 data forms, nine verification forms and a mobile phone from the suspect during a raid,” the spokesperson added.
Malik failed to provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the recovered documents. Further investigation is underway.
In a separate operation, the FIA Balochistan Zone arrested five suspects allegedly involved in human trafficking and rescued four individuals.
The Anti-Human Trafficking Circle apprehended Rasool Bacha, Aminullah, Hashmat Ali, Talib Hussain and Ehsanullah, who were reportedly members of a gang facilitating illegal travel abroad using fake documents and charging millions of rupees.
“The group was sending people to Iran and Turkiye through illegal routes and fake documents,” the FIA spokesperson said.
“Three of the suspects — Rasool, Aminullah and Hashmat — were listed as most wanted by Pakistani embassies in Iran and Turkiye,” he said, adding that they had already sent large numbers of people abroad illegally. Talib and Ehsanullah were found to be involved in helping people cross the border unlawfully.
During the raid, four citizens were rescued from the suspects’ residence. The group was reportedly working for an agent named Faheem Gujar based in Iran. The FIA said investigations are underway and raids are being conducted to apprehend other members of the network.

The carrier, which normally carries 130,000 people daily and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines, had planned to start ramping up operations on Sunday evening, after a labour relations board ordered the union to return to work and start binding arbitration.
The union said no, setting up an almost unprecedented standoff with the Canadian government, which had requested the back-to-work order.
The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents 10,000 Air Canada cabin crew, had pushed for a negotiated solution, saying binding arbitration would take pressure off the airline.
The attendants are striking for better wages and to be paid for work on the ground, such as boarding passengers. They are currently only paid when planes are moving, sparking some vocal support from Canadians on social media.
CUPE invited Air Canada back to the table to “negotiate a fair deal,” calling the order to end its strike unconstitutional. The airline said it would delay plans to restart operations from Sunday until Monday evening and described the union as illegally defying the labour board.
The government’s options to end the strike now include asking courts to enforce the order to return to work and seeking an expedited hearing. The minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of parliament, which are on break until September 15.
“The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector workers that may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labour Relations School.
Another option is to encourage bargaining, Pohler said.
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberal government moved to end the strike by asking the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order binding arbitration. The CIRB issued the order, which Air Canada had sought, and unionised flight attendants opposed.
The previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.
The CUPE said its rejection was unprecedented when such an order was made according to rules, known as Section 107, that the government invoked in this case.
Travelers at Toronto Pearson International Airport over the weekend said they were confused and frustrated about when they would be able to fly.
Italian Francesca Tondini, 50, sitting at the Toronto airport, said she supported the union even though she had no idea when she would be able to return home.
“They are right,” she said with a smile, pointing at the striking attendants.
The dispute between cabin crews and Air Canada hinges on the way airlines compensate flight attendants. Most, including Air Canada, have traditionally paid them only when planes are in motion.
In their latest contract negotiations, flight attendants in both Canada and the United States have sought compensation for hours worked, including for tasks such as boarding passengers.
New labour agreements at American Airlines and Alaska Airlines legally require carriers to start the clock for paying flight attendants when passengers are boarding.
American’s flight attendants are now also compensated for some hours between flights. United Airlines’ cabin crews, who voted down a tentative contract deal last month, also want a similar provision.</p><small>2025-08-18 04:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18095208f95de9e.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931596/anp-led-multiparty-moot-declares-past-policies-a-failure' target='_blank'><strong>ANP-led multiparty moot declares past policies ‘a failure’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A multiparty conference (MPC) on Sunday declared that past internal and foreign policies are responsible for the current instability and terrorism plaguing Pakis­tan, particularly in the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa and Balochistan provinces.
The conference, organised by the Awami National Party (ANP), asserted that peace and development are not possible without democracy, the supremacy of the constitution, and granting rights to the provinces.
Although 20 political parties atten­ded the conference, the PTI was absent. According to ANP sources, the PTI was invited to the conference, but no prominent leader from the party attended it on Sunday.
Attendees included Senator Aimal Wali Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui and PPP’s Nayyer Bukhari, among others.

Calls for an end to military operations in KP, Balochistan

In a joint declaration, the participants condemned all forms of terrorism and extremism, which they alleged were a result of past policies, and stressed the need for new steps to address the issues.
The declaration suggested an end to military operations in KP and Balochistan and called for the establishment of a “Truth Commission, under judicial oversight, to investigate losses”. The participants also demanded the abolition of so-called “death squads” and illegal armed groups to protect citizens.
The conference urged for the full implementation of the 18th Constitu­tional Amendment and suggested that non-constitutional bodies, especially the Special Investment Facilita­tion Council (SIFC), should be abolished.
 






The participants stated that the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award should be implemented as per the Constitution and that the rights of provinces over their minerals and resources must be granted.
The declaration also suggested the cancellation of land allotments in Balochistan and KP.
On human rights, the participants of the meeting called the enforced disappearances a violation of the Constitution and demanded that all missing persons be recovered and produced in courts.
They also called for the release of political prisoners, the lifting of travel restrictions on politician Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal, and the abolition of the Peca Act to ensure media freedom.
The declaration stated that Pakis­tan should not participate in foreign wars and should remain neutral. It called for historic trade routes to be reopened and for the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their homes. It also demanded an halt to the forced repatriation of Afghan refugees.
Additionally, the declaration  rejected a proposal to merge the Levies Force with the police in Balochistan and the decision to merge the Frontier Consta­bulary with the Federal Constabulary.
It demanded that all powers in the merged districts be transferred to the civil administration and that laws like the “Action in Aid of Civil Power” be abolished.
The declaration demanded a relief package for flood-affected districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and handing over of Rescue 1122 vehicles to the provincial government.
However, PML-N and PPP refused to sign the joint declaration.

Last week, four Al Jazeera journalists were killed in cold blood, among them Anas al-Sharif, the most prominent face on the global television network who had courageously been reporting on the catastrophic war and famine conditions in Gaza. The journalists were killed in a drone attack on a makeshift media tent outside Al-Shifa hospital. Targeting journalists is a war crime but Israel has acted with impunity and has long shown contempt for international humanitarian law or norms.
The Israeli military has been carrying out deliberate assaults on journalists since its war on Gaza began nearly two years ago. According to the UN, 242 journalists have been killed in that period, which is described as the highest number in any conflict. Israel’s military claimed responsibility for the murder of Anas al-Sharif saying he was a “Hamas terrorist” — a patently false allegation that Al Jazeera vehemently denied. Labelling journalists as militants is a disingenuous tactic Israel has always used. According to the Israeli-Palestinian news outlet ‘+972 magazine’ Israel’s military has a special unit charged with identifying journalists to ‘smear’ as Hamas members and target them.
The killings of journalists sparked global outrage. UN Secretary General António Guterres denounced it and the UN’s Human Rights Office called it a grave breach of international law. Journalists’ bodies and human rights organisations, including Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Committee for the Protection of Journalists all issued strong condemnations of these extrajudicial murders and called for accountability and international action to stop Israel. There have been worldwide protests over the killings.
Clearly, Israel’s intent is to silence voices and prevent media coverage of the atrocities and war crimes it is committing in Gaza as well as the mass starvation it has subjected Palestinians to. Suppressing the truth is a time-old practice of occupying forces, but it is always in vain. Despite Israel’s ban on the international media from reporting from Gaza, the world knows exactly what’s happening there, thanks to brave local journalists who have risked their lives to report the atrocities. Pictures of starving children have been on television screens across the world and video footage of Israeli soldiers firing on desperate aid-seekers have gone viral on social media. This, in fact, is the most documented genocide in history.

Even though Israel faces global isolation, US backing enables it to continue its genocidal war.

Israel has stepped up both its military offensive and its war on truth ahead of its planned takeover of Gaza City leading to the full occupation of Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his plan for the military capture of Gaza City earlier this month with Israel’s military given the go-ahead to launch an offensive to achieve this objective. This prompted worldwide condemnation with UN officials warning it would lead to “unimaginable suffering” and “another calamity”, which would reverberate across the region. Arab states, Pakistan, the EU and many Western countries denounced the impending move. In an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Aug 10, China, the UK, France, Russia and other members voiced opposition to the plan and called on Israel to reverse its decision. The only exception was the US, which backed Israel.
The shift in global especially Western opinion against Israel is palpable. It is being driven by the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and Israel’s use of starvation as weapon of war. As a BBC correspondent put it, “Starvation appears to be an inflection point for European countries — a moral impetus to drive their divergent diplomacy.” Last week, the foreign ministers of 27 countries, including over 20 European nations, issued a joint statement demanding that Israel allow unhindered aid into Gaza.
More Western nations are moving towards recognition of a Palestinian state. Australia has followed France, Canada and the UK, who announced plans to recognise Palestinian statehood, even though the UK has qualified that by saying it will refrain from doing so if Israel moves towards ending the war. France’s decision is particularly significant as it is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. These announcements are aimed at raising diplomatic pressure on Israel but haven’t been enough to stop it from continuing the war. As of now, 147 of the UN’s 193 member states recognise the state of Palestine.
The US, of course, remains opposed to recognition, saying that would reward Hamas. This echoes Tel Aviv’s stance. The US position on a two-state solution, which it long supported but is now ambivalent on, isolates it from the rest of the international community and bucks the global consensus reflected in several Security Council resolutions. Mike Huckabee, the American ambassador in Israel said in June — and wasn’t contradicted by the administration — that he did not think a sovereign Palestinian state is still a goal of US foreign policy. If this is the case, then it marks a significant shift in American policy under President Donald Trump. Again, it would be in line with Israel’s complete rejection of a Palestinian state and imply backing Netanyahu’s vision of a ‘Greater Israel’, a notion that has recently been condemned by the OIC.
Despite Israel’s growing global isolation, Netanyahu can ignore that as well as violate international law and continue its ethnic cleansing policy because he can count on unwavering US support. Trump’s oft-repeated desire for a Gaza ceasefire rings hollow as he has done nothing to pressure Israel in this direction. Throughout the war, Washington has extended military, diplomatic and financial support to Israel. It has also backed the militarised aid-distribution system Israel set up, which has been rejected by the UN and is widely seen as ‘death traps’; over 1,400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food at these sites.
All this with no real effort to restrain Netanyahu, has given Israel a licence to do whatever it wants in Gaza. The US has also not dissuaded Tel Aviv from its disastrous plan to take over Gaza City and eventually reoccupy the entire Strip. Washington and the self-proclaimed ‘man of peace’ are fully complicit in the catastrophic situation in Gaza. And the world, for all its condemnations and moral outrage, has been unable to mount real pressure on the US to change course.

These improvements — achieved mainly through IMF-prescribed austerity policies — have prompted global rating agencies to lift Pakistan’s sovereign rating, hinting at a restoration of market confidence in its economy. But the weaknesses are still obvious. Large-scale manufacturing shrank by 0.74pc last year, missing even the government’s modest growth target of 3.5pc.
This is not an isolated setback. Big industry has been stuck in a cycle of low growth or contraction for three years on the trot. That LSM, which contributes around 8pc to GDP, has failed to achieve sustainable momentum for three years running should set off alarm bells for policymakers as it is yet another reminder of the structural weaknesses weighing on the fragile national recovery. The year-on-year growth of 4.14pc in LSM output in June — the fourth straight month of positive numbers — offers hope.
Yet, the simultaneous month-on-month decline of 3.67pc underscores the brittleness of this recovery. This volatility indicates deeper, unresolved issues: higher than regional energy prices, weak investment on elevated borrowing costs, high tax burden on the corporate sector, policy unpredictability and ‘informal’ curbs on imports, including raw materials, due to a dollar liquidity crunch. The recent positive spurts in big industry output, therefore, should not be mistaken for a turnaround. The slower growth in LSM output mirrors the overall low growth of GDP, which expanded by just 2.7pc last year after swinging between contraction and modest growth in the previous two fiscal years.
In its last monetary policy statement, the State Bank rightly underlined the need for steadily executing structural reforms to consolidate recovery, deepen macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable growth. The recent macro improvements — reflected in lower inflation thanks to a global drop in oil and commodity prices, reduced fiscal deficit achieved largely through curtailed development spending and austerity measures and a build-up of foreign exchange reserves supported by debt rollovers by friendly countries, modest multilateral inflows, rising remittances and strict import controls — are fragile at best.
These improvements depend on external and temporary support, such as debt rollbacks, limited multilateral financing, remittances, etc, rather than durable fiscal and productivity reforms, leaving the economy only a small shock away from crisis. That Pakistan’s rating remains in speculative territory despite the upgrade from rating agencies is a reminder that markets still view the risks as high.
The question is: can policymakers use this breathing space to push through reforms that improve productivity, cut energy costs and attract investment? Without this, the economy will remain where it has been for years: underperforming, vulnerable and dangerously reliant on stopgap measures.

• Hamas calls relocation plans ‘a brutal assault’ and ‘blatant deception to cover up massacre’
• Israelis rally seeking end to war, prisoner swap deal
GAZA STRIP: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli attacks killed at least 40 people on Saturday, as the Israeli military hinted at an approaching call to push civilians from Gaza City ahead of a new offensive.
The latest toll comes more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to capture the Palestinian territory’s largest city, following 22 months of war that have created dire humanitarian conditions.
According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of the Palestinians killed on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting to collect food aid near distribution sites in the north and in the south.
Ahead of the offensive, COGAT said that starting from Sunday, the military would supply more tents and shelter equipment.
“As part of the preparations to move the population from combat zones to the southern Gaza Strip for their protection, the supply of tents and shelter equipment to Gaza will resume,” it said in a statement.
 






Hamas later slammed the move, saying the announcement was part of a “brutal assault to occupy Gaza City”.
Earlier, Gaza’s civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said conditions in Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood were rapidly deteriorating with residents having little to no access to food and water amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
The spokesman added that about 50,000 people were estimated to be in that area of Gaza City, “the majority of whom are without food or water” and lacking “the basic necessities of life”.
Bassal told AFP the number of people killed in the central Gaza Strip on Saturday had risen to 40.
On Friday, the Israeli military said its troops were operating in Zeitun.
Hamas said in a statement that Israeli forces had been carrying out a “sustained offensive in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods of Gaza City, particularly in Zeitun”.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army’s chief of staff said Sunday the military was pressing ahead with plans for the next phase of its Gaza offensive, with a focus on Gaza City.
“Today we are approving the plan for the next phase of the war,” Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said during a field visit to the Palestinian territory, according to an army statement.
In response, Hamas said the plans would result in “a new wave of extermination and mass displacement”.
The Palestinian group also condemned the proposals “a major war crime” which it said reflected Israel’s “disregard for international and humanitarian law”.
Hamas said Israel’s statements on this, including its plans for the installation of tents in southern Gaza, were “a blatant deception to cover up the imminent massacre and forced displacement”.
Israelis rally
Demonstrators across Israel called on Sunday for an end to the Gaza war and a deal to release prisoners still held by Hamas, a push lambasted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.
The protests come more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to capture Gaza City.
A huge Israeli flag covered with portraits of the remaining captives was unfurled in Tel Aviv’s so-called Hostage Square – which has long been a focal point for protests throughout the war.
Demonstrators also blocked roads, including the highway connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem where they set tires on fire, according to local media footage.
Some Israeli government members who oppose any deal with Hamas slammed Sunday’s demonstrations.
Famine warnings
The Israeli plans to expand the war into Gaza City and nearby refugee camps have sparked an international outcry as well as domestic opposition.
UN-backed experts have warned of widespread famine unfolding in the territory, where Israel has drastically curtailed the amount of humanitarian aid it allows in.

• Move comes amid push to address continuing glut in gas network
ISLAMABAD: The government is almost set to allow new gas connections at the price of imported LNG — around Rs3,900 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at the current rate — and almost four times the current connection fee.
Sources told Dawn that a summary has been moved by the petroleum division to the federal cabinet for lifting the ban on new connections, with a first-year target of 120,000.
Priority would be given to applicants who had previously been issued demand notices or had paid the urgent fee but could not get connections because of a subsequent ban. The number of new connections would be enhanced for next year.
Around 250,000 applicants fall in this category, who would have to file affidavits not to approach the courts for their past claims and the connection fee increase. Before the ban, consumers were allowed to pay an upfront fee of Rs25,000 to secure a connection on a priority basis, unlike the routine Rs5,000-Rs7,500 fee. On the other hand, a new LNG connection earlier cost Rs15,000.
At present, more than 3.5 million applications for new connections are pending with the gas companies. While new connections provide an additional avenue for the gas companies to claim a guaranteed return on fixed assets (pipelines and related infrastructure), this also leads to higher gas losses and lower revenue recoveries on top of greater gas shortages in winter.
No wonder then that the Lahore-based Sui Northern is rationing gas supplies even before the peak winter demand and provides gas to domestic consumers for 6-9 hours per day — at breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. The recent increase in fixed charges starting July 1, 2025 by 50pc provides an additional incentive to secure higher funds without the additional gas supply.
 
 

The moratorium on new gas connections was imposed in 2009, partially removed after six years before being enforced again in 2022 due to rising gas shortages. Sources said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had recently expressed displeasure with delays in new connections.
New connections
The new connection fee would now be set at Rs40,000-50,000 and the consumers would be billed at the notified re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) price — currently at about Rs3200 per mmBtu. The final price, including general sales tax, would go up to Rs3,900-Rs4,000 per mmBtu. The average gas price for high-end domestic consumers with a monthly consumption of 300 cubic metres per month currently stands at Rs3,300 per mmBtu and goes up to Rs4,200 per mmBtu for more than 400 cubic metres of monthly consumption.
The cabinet was informed that a comparative price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was worked out at around Rs5,300 per mmBtu, and it was being used by millions of poor and lower-middle-class consumers, including those in the remote areas, which meant the LNG-based piped gas supply would still be cheaper 35-40pc.
Gas surplus
The removal of the gas connection ban is being pushed to address a continuing glut in the gas network that is putting at risk the integrity of the pipeline system and the sovereign international commitments. The Ministry of Finance recently suggested considering “demand side intervention through lifting of moratorium on new gas connections” to address the issue of the LNG surplus.
The higher LNG imports also involve greater foreign exchange requirements. Interestingly, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had been resisting allowing the cost of LNG diversion to domestic consumers for almost a decade, but it recently allowed Rs75 billion in revenue requirements of gas companies for the 2015-22 backlog and indicated it’d adjust the 2023-25 claims in the subsequent price revisions.
Even with existing gas connections, the two gas companies, particularly SNGPL serving Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, face acute gas shortages in winters and imported LNG supply to residential consumers leads to the multiplication of circular debt. Already, the gas companies face around Rs200bn of annual revenue shortfall on this account.
However, the government has found itself in a paradoxical situation owing to economic slowdown, forced closure of gas to industrial captive power plants, unaffordable electricity rates, and insignificant utilisation of LNG by the power sector, for which the entire import arrangement was made in 2015-16, including sovereign commitments and more than $7bn worth of infrastructure.
The mandatory 66pc LNG utilisation in four “must-run” power projects of over 5200MW, for which the long-term international contracts were signed in 2015-16 and then in 2020-21, has since been reduced to 33pc LNG utilisation. These plants, however, remain outside the grid through tactical operations, shifting the power sector’s circular debt to the petroleum sector.
At present, more than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of domestic gas fields have been put on forced closure to create space for the imported LNG at more than twice the domestic producer price.
This is not only at the expense of domestic gas fields, but also causes weekly losses of billions of rupees to gas producers, compromising future exploration and development activities.
This means at least three monthly cargoes under the long-term contracts with Qatar have become surplus. This is on top of the diversion of a monthly LNG cargo to the international market that was contracted by Pakistan under a guaranteed private long-term contract.
Last winter, the government had postponed five cargoes — 500mmcfd — from Qatar, which are now due for rescheduling in FY2026 on top of about 150 annual routine cargoes.

• Official says ‘faulty carriages’ impede train’s ability to stop
LAHORE/BAHAWALPUR: The Karachi-bound Awam Express train hit a sand-hump and derailed on Sunday morning apparently due to brake failure, leaving a passenger dead and 33 others injured.
The initial assessment held train driver responsible for not stopping the train properly owing to over speeding.
On the other hand, the federal minister for railways ordered for a ‘thorough inquiry’, appointing the federal government inspector of railways, a senior position in the department, to probe the incident and submit a report.
The train was on its way to Karachi after departing from Lahore railway station in the evening.
When it reached near Lodhran, around 400km from Lahore, it received reception signals for Line No-5. But the driver, allegedly due to over-speeding, couldn’t stop and hit the sand-hump.
 
 

As a result, the train engine, four passenger coaches and a luggage van derailed completely. Some of them overturned, leaving a passenger dead and 33 others injured.
Soon after the accident, cries for help were heard from the derailed coaches as passengers remained stuck for sometime and later succeeded in coming out on their own.
Rescue-1122 reached the spot after some time and started shifting the injured passengers to the government hospital where one of them died.  He was identified as Waqas, 37, from Khushab.
According to an internal document, while entering the Line No-5 the train overshoot and hit the sand-hump, leaving the locomotive and five coaches, including a luggage van, derailed.
A relief train from Multan was also called to reach the spot to remove the affected coaches and engine from the line in a bid to restore the rail traffic on Main Line-1.
As many as four trains, including 6-Down, 48-Down and 39-Up, delayed for hours.
The initial investigation held the driver responsible for the derailment. “Had he applied brakes well on time, he would have averted the crash. We have reached a consensus that he failed to stop the train on Line No-5, left with no option but to enter the sand-hump,” it concluded.
On the other hand, a senior PR official held faulty passenger coaches responsible for the accident and requested the federal minister for railways to thoroughly get this aspect investigated.
“In fact, the reports mentioned on papers are different than the practical [situation]. On paper, this train had one dummy coach [the coach without brake]. But I think it is not correct, because if there is one dummy among 12 coaches, the driver would have succeeded in stopping the train without any issue. This means, there were around 5/6 coaches that were dummy but not mentioned in the papers as faulty,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.
Talking about the rolling stock, he said a number of passenger coaches and goods’ wagons are not up to the mark, leading to frequent derailment incidents.
The Federal Railways Minister, Hanif Abbasi, while presiding over an emergency meeting, reprimanded officers for not doing well for the safety of passengers.
 
 

The minister also ordered the officers to ground dummy coaches from the railway system and if there is need to stop operation of any train, it must be done. “The officers must come out of their AC offices and inspect the rail track, rolling stock etc,” he said.
According to rescue 1122 media coordinator Muhammad Safdar, 11 passengers were rendered first aid on the spot, while 22 seriously injured including six women, were taken to DHQ hospital, Lodhran.
A press release issued by Multan Railways division, 21 passengers suffered injuries and out of them two were taken to Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur.
Divisional Superi­ntendent Iftikhar Ahmed of Multan Railway division, who also rushed to Lodhran Railway station, told journalists that the down track has been cleared and the derailed bogies have been removed after 10 hours’ struggle.
Despite derailment on the down railway track, he said, the railway traffic has not been suspended and Awam Express passengers were sent to Karachi by the Hazara Express.

Chairing a review meeting on cashless economy in Islamabad on Sunday, he directed all the provincial chief secretaries to fully cooperate with the federal government in expanding the Raast digital payment system to the district level.
The prime minister expr­essed satisfaction over the progress made towards a cashless economy and digital financial systems.
 
 

The meeting was briefed that Pakistan will develop digital public infrastructure to create digital IDs for every citizen, integrating national identity cards, biometrics and mobile numbers.
These digital IDs will enable secure and efficient payments.
It was further said that the provincial governments have shown significant progress in linking government-to-public and public-to-government payments with the Raast system.
The meeting was info­rmed that the federal development agencies have granted right of way for fibre connectivity, while discussions are ongoing with Pakistan Railways and the National Highway Authority to expand digital infrastructure.

Set in the 24th century, it showcases astounding technological leaps. One unmissable character is a humanoid robot called Data. Although immensely capable, he’s unable to experience emotions; any attempt returns comical failures.
Meanwhile, humans have spread to other planets. In one episode, one such planet is visited by a powerful character Ardra. A contract is said to entitle her to ownership of both the planet and its inhabitants. The people submit to her, convinced of her power and authenticity; however, the protagonist, Captain Picard, demands arbitration. Confident of success, Ardra agrees but only if Data is the arbiter. Her reason: the artificial intelligence (AI) within him “is incapable of deceit and bias”. Hold that thought!
We may not yet have a Data, but we are unmistakably in the age of AI. It can conduct surgeries, decide lawsuits and drive cars. But imagine having your chest ripped open by a robot which, although well-calibrated and immune to fatigue, overestimates your pain threshold because of your skin colour. Now switch to a courtroom, where an AI judge — invited by the honourable Supreme Court — hands down a life sentence without explaining the decision, as the commercial licence prohibits disclosure. The scene shifts again: you are in a self-driving car, thoroughly tested in the US but unable to recognise a donkey cart in Pakistan, and it accelerates instead of stopping.
These are no improbable hypotheticals. AI learns from human experiences fed to it during training; any exceptions result in biased decisions that can be inconvenient, life-changing, even fatal. For example, in 2016, a passport application of an Asian man in New Zealand was rejected because AI declared the eyes in his photo were closed. They weren’t. They were only smaller. The applicant had ‘no hard feelings’ against the robot. Glenn Rodríguez, though, wanted to be released from jail after an exemplary 26-year record. However, the proprietary AI system COMPAS denied his parole application; and the board had no idea why. Later research showed that COMPAS deemed him high-risk simply because he was black. In 2016 again, a self-driving Tesla crashed into a truck because it mistook its white side for the sky. The driver died.
The point is not to scare anyone, it is to raise awareness. AI holds immense potential, but its ability to mimic or even surpass human accuracy across a range of situations can inflate trust in its safety and ethicality, ignoring the fact that the learning process behind this impressive performance is not faithful to human cognition and neurobiology. Also, modern AI systems are complex, with properties that may only be discovered long after their creation. They can embed systemic human bias and perpetuate it at scale: due to limited medical access, dermatological data grossly underrepresents people with darker skin tones. This leaves even doctors with little evidence to test the efficacy of costly treatments — and AI risks reinforcing such under-treatment. Accordingly, legislation such as the EU AI Act classifies systems impacting human welfare, opportunities and safety as high-risk to stamp the importance of the responsible use of AI.

AI’s ability to mimic human accuracy can inflate trust in its safety.

For an ethnically, environmentally and socioeconomically diverse Pakistan, this presents challenges and opportunities. Bias is multidimensional and cannot be estimated or even defined without engaging stakeholders in a cross-spectrum manner. Therefore, this is an opportunity for researchers from both the technical and social sciences to collectively engage communities and develop contextually aware and demographically representative AI systems for Pakistan. By embracing this appr­o­ach, Pakistan can st­­r­ategically cultivate AI solutions that are in­­herently fairer and more effective for its unique sub-populatio­­ns, directly addressing existing healthcare inequalities and ensuring equitable outcomes in areas like criminal justice and economic opportunities.
To enable broader societal uptake and understanding, it is also important to develop conversion courses that allow people from all academic backgrounds to engage with AI. Experience from the UK shows that such courses attract students from diverse fields and foster stakeholder engagement directly within the classroom.
Fairness, equity and justice are divine ideals, yet they are fundamental to human dignity. The quest for them has now turned to machines. But will artificial intelligence succeed where biological intelligence has failed? This question brings empirical ethics into the spotlight. Regardless, the road to the elusive ideal of true justice is paved with the fundamentals of transparency, integrity and inclusivity.

According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the case was dismissed after “no incriminating material is available on record which connects the accused persons with the commission of alleged offences.
“Hence, the request of 10 days for physical remand of the accused persons is hereby turned down, and the accused persons present in the court are hereby discharged in this case.”
The order added that no private witness of the occurrence was associated during the raid, nor were any statements taken.
“Moreover, no permission for making a raid is attached with the file on a private place. Prima facie, it seems that the accused persons were included in the case on the basis of forged and concocted facts,” the order said.
Lawyer Haider Butt represented the accused in the case. He confirmed to Dawn.com that all the accused were released and the case was discharged against them.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the Punjab government ordered the arrests after videos of the party, purportedly involving 50-60 individuals, including transgender persons, went viral on social media.
Fashion designer Maria B initially posted videos on her social media accounts, demanding action against “transgender activists” that she claimed featured in the clips, terming such gatherings “against the moral values of the country.”
Per the FIR, the footage, dated August 1, allegedly contained “explicit content, prompting public outcry and a swift response from law enforcement.”
The case was registered on behalf of the government at the Naseerabad police station against “a group of 50 to 60 transgender persons under sections 292 (sale of obscene material), 292-A (printing/advertising obscene matter), and 294 (obscene acts in public) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alongside Section 6 of the Sound System Act.”
Following the arrests, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Lahore, Faisal Kamran, had said, “Promoting obscenity under the guise of a party or photoshoot is a serious legal offence.”
He said that illegal and unethical acts will not be tolerated in any form. “All individuals involved in the incident will be brought to justice.”
Kamran added that the screening of the banned film Joyland, which features a transgender love affair, was also stopped in the city. “Strict action will be taken against any activity conflicting with Islam and the law.”
The movie was set to screen in Lahore today, nearly two years after it was barred from cinemas in Punjab. The long-awaited screening was said to take place at an alternative venue instead of a movie theatre.
Responding to the development, Islamabad-based transgender rights activist Nayyab Ali said in a post on X that individuals seen in the video were “not trans activists” and had “nothing to do with our movement.”
Ali also alleged that the video was shot at a private party and only went viral after Maria B posted it, saying, “If it’s fahashi (vulgarity), then who spread it to millions? Maria B did. That’s a crime itself.”
Meanwhile, human rights activists raised concerns over the potential misuse of morality laws on social media. “While obscenity laws exist, their vague wording often leads to arbitrary enforcement, disproportionately targeting marginalised communities,” said a legal expert, requesting anonymity.
The government authorities also vowed to expand the crackdown on “immoral activities” across the province.</p><small>2025-08-18 01:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619288-swat-headmasters-quick-thinking-saves-nearly-1000-students-from-raging-floods' target='_blank'><strong>Swat headmaster's quick thinking saves nearly 950 students from raging floods</strong></a><br><p>

The senior journalist was found dead in his car, parked on Hyderabad Road in Sanghar, on Saturday night under what police termed “mysterious circumstances”. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound to the head.
Sanghar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abid Baloch told Dawn.com that police were investigating the death of DawnNewsTV reporter Khawar Husain Bajwa from “all possible angles”.
“The postmortem of the journalist was conducted in Sanghar’s Civil Hospital, and police are awaiting the provisional findings of the process,” he said.
“Apparently, there is a single bullet wound from a 9mm pistol with an exit wound on the left side of the temple”, SSP Baloch said, adding that only one bullet casing was found.
“We are not drawing any conclusion at this point and are looking at this case from all possible angles,” the SSP explained.
According to Sanghar police, Husain’s body had been kept in the cold storage facility at the Red Crescent hospital in Latifabad, as his parents are said to be arriving from the United States early on Monday morning.
“Then the body will be taken to Sanghar, which is the ancestral home of the journalist, for burial,” the SSP said.
Later today, the Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) ordered the formation of a fact-finding committee under the supervision of the Sindh Additional IGP (Counter-Terrorism Department) Azad Khan to probe Husain’s death.
According to a copy of the order seen by Dawn.com, the committee will comprise the Additional IGP, Karachi West Zone Deputy IGP Irfan Baloch and SSP Baloch.
“The committee will do [a] preliminary investigation and ascertain facts from all angles. The complete report into the incident may be finalised in two days for the perusal of IGP Sindh,” the order read.
Separately, a request was submitted to the Sindh Home Department for the constitution of a medical board comprising senior doctors and forensic experts to perform a “fair, transparent, and impartial postmortem examination”.
The letter, submitted by Additional IGP (Operations) Zubair Nazir Ahmed Shaikh and seen by Dawn.com, requested the formation of the medical panel so that “the matter may reach its logical and conclusive end in accordance with the principles of justice”.
Meanwhile, Sanghar police obtained a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera recording of a restaurant, outside of which was the car in which his body was found.
The SSP stated that a guard at the restaurant told police that he arrived at around 7pm for his duties, and Husain arrived in his vehicle 45 minutes to an hour later.
The guard told the police that the journalist had used the restaurant’s toilet and then sat back in the vehicle.
“After some time when he didn’t place any order, the guard, out of curiosity, went towards the vehicle and reported back to the restaurant manager, telling him he noticed something unusual with a man sitting inside,” the SSP said.
“Two waiters arrived to confirm the watchman’s statement and found out that blood was oozing from the right side of his [Husain’s] temple, with a 9mm pistol in his right hand,” SSP Baloch added.
According to the SSP, Husain’s brother-in-law told police that he didn’t inform them about his Saturday arrival, although he asked them to hold an annual religious ritual as per the family’s tradition. Husain neither told friends in Sanghar about his visit nor did he attend the ritual.
“His sister confirmed that he had celebrated Eidul Azha with her on her insistence, after their parents shifted to the US this May,” the SSP said.
Last night, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought a report from the police chief, with instructions that the investigation be handed over to the best police officer.</p><small>2025-08-17 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/172250182d652f1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931482/fazl-questions-govts-writ-in-tribal-areas-as-various-political-parties-set-their-demands' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl questions govt’s writ in tribal areas as various political parties set their demands</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday questioned the government’s writ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tribal areas as various political parties set their demands in a declaration at the Awami National Party-organised multiparty conference (MPC) in Islamabad.
The ANP organised the conference, which was attended by representatives from the PPP, JI, MQM, JUI-F and Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), among other parties
Speaking at the conference, Fazl said: “No doubt there is a question mark on the government’s writ [in KP’s tribal areas].”
He added that the tribal areas of the province are in the grip of armed groups, as people have to pay extortion money to them.
“Armed groups take 10 per cent of the officially approved funds,” he claimed.
He also questioned why there was a need to restore the jirga system after seven years of the merger of tribal areas with KP.
The multiparty conference also saw speeches by ANP central president Senator Aimal Wali Khan, National Democratic Movement chief Mohsin Dawar, Qaumi Watan Party chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and BNP-M’s Sanaullah Baloch, among others.
The conference’s declaration was read out by Aimal and termed the “ongoing unrest, terrorism and violation of constitutional rights in Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as the result of past flawed domestic and foreign policies”.
It added that all the participating parties agree that sustainable peace and development in Pakistan is not possible without democracy, supremacy of the Constitution and the legitimate rights of provinces.
The resolution called for the cessation of all ongoing military operations in KP and Balochistan, adding that a truth commission should be formed under the supervision of the judiciary to conduct an impartial investigation into the human and financial losses.
“The so-called ‘death squads’ and illegal armed groups should be immediately eliminated, and the protection of public life and property should be ensured,” the resolution read.
It also called for the 18th Amendment to be fully implemented in accordance with its original spirit so that the provinces have their legitimate powers.
The declaration also “condemned” the conversion of the Frontier Constabulary into the Federal Constabulary, and opposed the proposal to merge the Levies with the police in Balochistan.
The failure to arrest the murderers of the ANP’s martyred leaders was also condemned. The declaration called for the establishment of a judicial commission for the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.
Expressing regret over the flooding situation in KP, the MPC also postponed the ‘Islamabad Peace March’, previously scheduled for August 23.
“The new date of the Islamabad Peace March would be decided through mutual consultation,” the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier in the week, Aimal said that the law and order in KP was deteriorating rapidly, and feared that the worsening situation in Bajaur may engulf the entire province.
Around 55,000 people have been displaced from different areas of Mamund tehsil in Bajaur tribal district due to the military operation, while 400,000 residents remain hostage to the suddenly-imposed curfew, local lawmaker Nisar Baz had told the KP Assembly on Monday.</p><small>2025-08-17 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1721461868da72a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931480/terence-stamp-actor-who-played-superman-villain-zod-dies-aged-87' target='_blank'><strong>Terence Stamp, actor who played Superman villain Zod, dies aged 87</strong></a><br><p>Terence Stamp, who made his name as an actor in 1960s London and went on to play the arch-villain General Zod in the Hollywood hits Superman and Superman II, has died aged 87, his family said on Sunday.
The Oscar-nominated actor starred in films ranging from Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Theorem in 1968 and A Season in Hell in 1971 to The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 1994 in which he played a transgender woman.
The family said in a statement to Reuters that Stamp died on Sunday morning.
“He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer, that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,” the family said. “We ask for privacy at this sad time.”
Born in London’s East End in 1938, the son of a tugboat stoker, he endured the bombing of the city during World War II before leaving school to work initially in advertising, eventually winning a scholarship to go to drama school.
Famous for his good looks and impeccable dress sense, he formed one of Britain’s most glamorous couples with Julie Christie, with whom he starred in Far From the Madding Crowd in 1967. He also dated the model Jean Shrimpton and was chosen as a muse by photographer David Bailey.
After failing to land the role of James Bond to succeed Sean Connery, he appeared in Italian films and worked with Federico Fellini in the late 1960s.
He dropped out of the limelight and studied yoga in India before landing his most high-profile role — as General Zod, the megalomaniacal leader of the Kryptonians, in Superman in 1978 and its sequel in 1980.
He went on to appear in a string of other films, including Valkyrie with Tom Cruise in 2008, The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon in 2011 and movies directed by Tim Burton.</p><small>2025-08-17 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17194143baa4f66.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931473/7-killed-in-kps-kohat-over-personal-enmity-police-official' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed in KP’s Kohat over ‘personal enmity’: police official</strong></a><br><p>Seven people were shot dead over a personal enmity in the Raigi Sheno Khel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s district Kohat on Saturday night, police said.
According to the first information report (FIR) available with Dawn.com and lodged by an injured complainant, Zahid Noor at the City police station: “Seven people from two families were killed in the firing when they were returning from the picnic at Raigi Sheno Khel area of Kohat district.”
It said that they had gone for the picnic to Tanda dam and upon returning from it, they came under attack from two sides, resulting in the deaths of six people on the spot.
The FIR copy said that one of the injured succumbed to the injuries at the KDA hospital.
Kohat District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah told Dawn.com that upon investigation, police found that the incident was a result of old enmity, adding, ’’the ones who were targeted have a history of enmity.“
The DPO further added that the deceased went to Tanda Dam, where, on their return — they were attacked. “There were a total of 11 individuals, of whom seven were attacked,’’ Zahidullah added.
According to the DPO, the deceased and injured mainly belonged to Tehsil Sadda of Kurram district and had been residing in Mohammad Zai village of Kohat for a long time due to family enmity.
The DPO told Dawn.com that police have started an investigation.
The police have initially registered a case against unknown persons and started further investigation. Moreover, after the incident, the relatives wanted to protest by placing the bodies on Hangu Road, but the protest was cancelled due to the efforts of local elders and the assurance of the police that  the culprits would be arrested at the earlier.
The first information report was lodged under sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last month, rivals shot dead two individuals and injured another over a murder enmity in the Miankhel Bazaar of Kohat city, police had said.
In June, the police arrested PPP leader and former provincial minister Malik Amjid Afridi in Islamabad in connection with the murder of former district nazim Engineer Malik Asad.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes during the conflict, including advanced French-made Dassult Rafale jets. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
 
 

Addressing a seminar in Lahore today, Naqvi said he was involved in several matters surrounding the war with India and was privy to several key pieces on information.
“The army, air force, navy and government have all been acknowledged during the past month-and-a-half, but our intelligence agencies were doing important work behind the scenes,” he said.
“Our institutions had information on India’s (plans) well ahead of time. We knew whatever they (India) planned, what aircraft they would use. Our intelligence agencies’ role was so important, but they do not come forward. We need to acknowledge them.”
The interior minister said that when Indian planes were downed, the decision was made not to announce this without evidence.
“We had radar data, but we needed field evidence,” he explained. “Within minutes, we received video footage of all six planes which were shot down. We have this footage.”
Naqvi then outlined two incidents where seven Indian missiles struck a Pakistani base, adding that once they were launched, it became clear they were heading across the border.
“People got worried, we have important hardware at this base,” he said, not mentioning the base’s name or location. “Not a single missile hit that base. Some fell short, some hit outside the base.
“When we launched our missiles, we targeted military installations near populated areas, but made every effort to avoid civilian casualties,” Naqvi added. “We destroyed one of their biggest oil depots and there were no civilian casualties. That is when we knew that God was helping us.”
The interior minister added that Nur Khan Airbase near Rawalpindi, which was struck by Indian missiles, suffered no damage.
“We had damage at one base where a member of the air force was martyred, but that’s about it,” he said.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In July, United States President Donald Trump said that five jets were shot down during the conflict. He made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, but did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
While describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, PAF Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed on May 12 said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
Last month, Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang lauded the “exemplary performance” during the aerial clash, praising the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief”.</p><small>2025-08-17 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619212-karachi-likely-to-receive-moderate-to-heavy-rainfall-through-august-23' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to receive moderate to heavy rainfall through August 23</strong></a><br><p>
