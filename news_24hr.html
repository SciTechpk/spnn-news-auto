<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2112292386fa211.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932293/sc-accepts-imrans-bail-pleas-in-eight-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>SC accepts Imran’s bail pleas in eight May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the bail pleas of former prime minister Imran Khan in eight cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander.
The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran had challenged that dismissal before the apex court.
A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, which also comprised Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the petitions today.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi represented the state.
Both concluded their arguments, following which the CJP announced the bench’s decision.
However, Imran has multiple other cases against him. Imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, the PTI founder is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The PTI hailed the SC ruling, using the hashtag “Victory For Imran Khan” in its post on X.
 






The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, the Punjab prosecutor informed the court that he could not appear yesterday due to illness.
CJP Afridi, noting he had two questions from Naqvi, asked, “You must have read the Lahore High Court’s verdict. Can a final observation be made in a case of bail?”
During the hearing on August 12, the chief justice had raised questions over some observations made by the LHC, noting that the SC will not touch upon the legal findings so as not to affect any party’s case.
Asking his second question, the CJP said, “This same court (LHC) gave bail to a suspect on the charge of conspiracy. Will the principle of precedence not apply to this case?”
The prosecutor responded that a court’s observation in a bail case was always of an “interim nature”. “A court observation does not have any impact on the trial,” he contended.

The severe flooding destroyed earthen homes and agricultural fields in Sumra Nashaib, Dulu Nas­haib, Lohanch Nashaib, Mir­ani Paka, Loni, Darkhan, Cha­dhar, Mohana, and Mosan Shah, leaving families displaced and without shelter. Many struggle to save livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
In Taunsa, several villages such as Bait Lakho, Jarh Leghari, Jarah, Urra, Bodu Manaan, Thulla Chaki, Eida Arain, Basti Habib, Lal Shah, and Kotla Miran have been submerged, with houses reduced to rubble. Thousands of acres of crops in these areas are underwater and entirely ruined, leaving the displaced population without shelter or livelihood, forced to live under the open sky.
In Muzaffargarh, hundreds of residents in villages of Tehsils Jatoi and Alipur were also compelled to evacuate as floodwaters from the Indus inundated their areas.
 






In Tehsil Jatoi, the villages of Laskani and Kehal saw mass evacuations after a breach of 10 to 15 feet occurred in a Zamindara bund. Locals attempted to fill the breach on their own, receiving no assistance from district or divisional authorities.
Similarly, in Alipur tehsil, the villages of Bait Dewan, Mouza Shahpur, Mouza Thehri, Mouza Phul Sanjra, Basti Gishkori, Basti Faizu Mandoos, Basti Allah Bachaya Gopang, Basti Kolachi, Basti Bosan, Basti Turk, Basti Lashari, and Basti Noor Mand Gopang have also been inundated. Cotton, sesame, mung beans, and other crops have been destroyed.
In the Langarwah area of Alipur tehsil, the rising level of Indus River breached a flood protection bund on Wednesday, inundating hundreds of homes and vast agricultural lands.
Wazir Khan Gopang, a resident of Bait Dewan, said that his 20 acres of sesame and 10 acres of cotton had been destroyed. He lamented the government’s failure to take preventive measures. He and his family had to relocate, and he was struggling to save his livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
PDMA warning
As rivers swell and dams near maximum capacity, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a red alert across Punjab. With rainfall expected to continue until August 24, district administrations have been instructed to stay on high alert, and citizens are urged to exercise extreme caution.
 
 

The PDMA issued a comprehensive alert following widespread monsoon rains and warned of a worsening flood situation in several districts.
Over the past 24 hours, Narowal recorded the highest rainfall at 94mm, followed by Sargodha (54mm), Joharabad (39mm), Sheikhupura (36mm), and Faisalabad (31mm), with significant precipitation also reported in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, and other major cities.
Heavy rains are expected to continue in most districts of Punjab until August 24, with concerns over thundershowers and potential cloudbursts in the upper regions.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the current monsoon spell was a bit more intense than the previous ones and directed all district administrations to remain on high alert.
The Indus River is experiencing medium-level flooding at Taunsa and Chashma, while low-level flooding has been reported at Tarbela and Kalabagh.
The Sutlej River is also at a low flood level at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki.
Critical water storage levels indicate that Tarbela Dam is at 98pc capacity and Mangla Dam at 74pc, while Indian dams are reportedly around 70pc full.
Authorities have warned of a likely increase in water flow in the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers and their tributaries due to the anticipated heavy rains.
The alert has been issued to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and relevant departments including local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, and transport.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed has instructed Wasa officials and district administrations to take preventive measures and ensure full emergency preparedness.
Citizens have been advised to exercise extreme caution during the rainy season, particularly keeping children away from rainwater drains, low-lying areas, rivers, and canals.
Rescue and relief agencies have been directed to maintain their presence in the field during periods of rainfall.

According to the Zoom Earth weather tracking website, an intense system forming over Sindh would hit urban centres like Hyderabad and Karachi after midnight on Wedn­esday. The system, which is likely to head out to sea by the morning, might precipitate heavily concentrated downpours in lower Sindh.
 
 

A spokesman for the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA) advised residents in vulner­able areas, including Karachi, Hyde­rabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas and Sukkur, to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
Urban flooding is expe­cted to persist in Kar­achi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
Simultaneously, districts such as Thatta, Badin, Jamshoro and Da­du face an elevated risk of flash flooding.
Rising water levels in the Indus River and its tributaries may inundate low-lying areas, prompting fears of widespread disruption.
Major highways and local roads could be sub merged, severely affecting traffic and daily routines across the region.
In anticipation of flooding, authorities have urged residents to relocate valuables and livestock to safer locations.
Households are advised to prepare emergency kits with essential supplies, including food, water, medicines and first aid. Extreme caution is recommended when handling electrical appliances, and submerged roads or electric poles should be strictly avoided.
Disruptions in power and telecom services are also likely. Citizens are encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to a post by the FO on X today, Wang was received by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar.
“He will hold important meetings, including the 6th Strategic Dialogue between China and Pakistan,” the post said.
 






The FO had previously posted that Wang had arrived in Islamabad last night, where he was received by Dar.
“Delighted to receive my dear friend, H.E. Wang Yi, Foreign Minister China, in Pakistan this evening,” Dar wrote on social media yesterday.
He added, “I look forward to productive discussions tomorrow at our Dialogue, and with the leadership during his calls on President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.”
 






Earlier yesterday, the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue was held in Kabul between Dar, Wang Yi and Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi, respectively, on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism,“ the FO said. “They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan.”
 






Last month, Pakistan and China agreed to launch joint training programmes in multiple fields, including construction engineering, artificial intelligence, agriculture and hospitality management, under the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II).
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit from August 31 to September 1. On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Earlier this week, the government announced that this upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC-II, focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.</p><small>2025-08-21 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a6460c431c2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932118/murad-urges-political-stakeholders-to-stop-pointing-finger-aid-karachis-recovery' target='_blank'><strong>Murad urges political stakeholders to stop pointing finger, aid Karachi’s recovery</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Expressing concern over performance of certain local bodies including towns under control of the opposition Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has called upon all political stakeholders to refrain from blame games and fulfil their respective responsibilities to  aid the city’s recovery.
Talking to the media and responding to a question on coordination and accountability among agencies during a visit to the city a day after heavy rain lashed the metropolis, the CM expressed concern over the performance of some local  representatives, including JI’s town chairmen, particularly after the formation of town administrations, which he said had led to division and inefficiency in  service delivery.
 
 

He acknowledged certain shortcomings, welcomed constructive criticism, and announced disciplinary action against officials who failed to perform.
He underlined the urgent need for modern and efficient drainage systems to mitigate the impact of extreme weather in the future, ensuring urban resilience and citizens’ safety.

CM acknowledges shortcomings in dealing with rain, vows disciplinary action against negligent officials

He said about “160 to 170 millimetres” of rain had fallen within three to four hours, aggregating to “185 to 200mm” in 12 hours — levels that naturally cause urban flooding in a densely populated city.
Despite the torrential rain, the chief minister claimed that the administration had managed to clear water from the city by late night.
Recalling the catastrophic flooding of 2020, he noted how water then had remained stagnant for over 24 hours, contrasting it with the relatively prompt drainage this time.
 
 

Addressing questions, Mr Shah said the World Bank had approved a $1.6 billion package for Karachi in 2020, with $100 million already disbursed, primarily to strengthen the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
He rejected “misleading narratives” about the funds, stressing that disbursements were phased and conditional on performance. He added that approximately Rs28 to Rs30b had been utilised transparently so far for critical water infrastructure upgrades.
Highlighting the chronic issue of fragmented road-cutting permissions issued independently by agencies such as the Cantonment Boards, KDA and KMC, he proposed establishing a “Central Road Cutting Authority” to regulate and oversee road excavation and repair, thereby preventing repeated damage to city roads.
He also pointed out that the powers of certain institutions, including the water board, had been devolved to the mayor’s office to strengthen urban governance. He praised Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab for enhancing resources and taking practical steps instead of merely demanding funds.

Judge Caprio, host of ABC series ‘Caught in Providence’ was known for his kindness, even while serving justice. According to CNN, Caprio billed his courtroom as a place “where people and cases are met with kindness and compassion“.
“Judge Frank Caprio passed away peacefully at the age of 88 after a long and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer,” said a post on the social media-famous judge’s Facebook account.
 
 

“Beloved for his compassion, humility, and unwavering belief in the goodness of people, Judge Caprio touched the lives of millions through his work in the courtroom and beyond,” the post recalled.
“His warmth, humour and kindness left an indelible mark on all who knew him […] In his honour, may we each strive to bring a little more compassion into the world — just as he did every day.”
Videos of Caprio “treating defendants with empathy and respect gained more than a billion views on social media and earned him the title of ‘the nicest judge in the world’”, Time magazine noted.
In clips posted on YouTube, Caprio is “often seen empathising with those in his courtroom”, CNN noted. “Caprio also used his fame to address issues like unequal access to the judicial system.”
In 2019, the internet sensation won the hearts of many when his interaction with a Pakistani student went viral. Caprio let off Ahmad Salman, an immigrant student, for three parking tickets.
A month later, the judge invited Salman to his family’s Sunday dinner, according to a snippet shared by the Caught in Providence show in 2022.
In a video statement, Judge Caprio’s son detailed that his father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago.
“It was the love and support that he received from all of you that lifted his spirits and boosted his soul to find the strength to fight on and outlive his diagnosis by a year and a half.
Caprio served as chief judge of the municipal court of Providence, Rhode Island, from 1985 to 2023, according to Time. He is survived by his wife Joyce Caprio, five children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p><small>2025-08-21 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21111759289fc2f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932283/olympic-champion-imane-khelif-denies-malicious-claims-of-retirement' target='_blank'><strong>Olympic champion Imane Khelif denies ‘malicious’ claims of retirement</strong></a><br><p>Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has denied claims made by her former manager that she has retired from the sport, saying she is still training regularly.
Algerian Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting were in the spotlight at the Paris Games last year over their eligibility after they had been disqualified from the 2023 World Championships by the IBA, which said sex chromosome tests had ruled them ineligible.
However, they competed in the women’s category in Paris after being cleared by the International Olympic Committee, with both winning gold medals in their weight classes.
Khelif has not competed since her win in Paris.
In an interview with French newspaper Nice-Matin on Wednesday, Khelif’s former manager Nasser Yesfah said she had “left the world of boxing”.
In a follow-up interview with the same newspaper hours later, Yesfah clarified he was only referring to Khelif’s boxing commitments in the city of Nice, where she was previously part of the Nice Azur club.
Khelif criticised Yesfah’s comments in a post on Facebook on Wednesday.
“It is based solely on statements made by a person who no longer represents me in any way, and whom I consider to have betrayed my trust and my country with his false and malicious statements,” Khelif wrote.
“I have never announced my retirement from boxing. I remain committed to my sporting career, training regularly and maintaining my physical fitness between Algeria and Qatar in preparation for upcoming events.
“The publication of such rumours is intended solely to disrupt and damage my sporting and professional career.”
Khelif had been due to compete in a World Boxing tournament in the Netherlands in June, but opted to skip it shortly after the governing body initially announced its plans to introduce sex testing for all boxers in its competitions.
World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst later apologised after Khelif was named in their announcement on mandatory sex testing, saying her privacy should have been protected.
Khelif, 26, has repeatedly said she was born a woman and has a long history in female boxing competitions. In March, she said she would defend her title at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p><small>2025-08-21 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2110080859227ee.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932122/rescue-operation-in-flood-hit-areas-completed-kp-cabinet-told' target='_blank'><strong>Rescue operation in flood-hit areas completed, KP cabinet told</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Rescue operation in the flood-hit areas has been completed, while search for the missing persons is still under way, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet was informed on Wednesday.
The cabinet met with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair and its members and senior government officials in attendance.
Officials informed participants that damage to infrastructure and public lives and property by rains and flash floods was being assessed and once the exercise was completed, its details would be laid before the cabinet.
Additional chief secretary (home and tribal affairs) Abid Majid said the relevant departments had been directed to expedite data collection for the early provision of compensation to the affected families.

CM orders immediate restoration of health centres, water supply

He said mobile phone service providers should ensure complete restoration of their coverage in the calamity-hit areas to people to get connected with relatives.
Mr Majeed said the planning and development department had come up with an app to ensure easy access to data in the affected areas.
Mr Gandapur said the compensation was being provided to the families of those killed in floods and those who suffered injuries.
He ordered immediate restoration of health centres in affected areas with full availability of essential medicines and deployment of mobile hospitals.
The chief minister called for proactive measures to prevent possible outbreaks of epidemics, provision of fodder for livestock, and necessary steps to protect animals from diseases.
He ordered the immediate restoration of drinking water schemes such as tube wells, and the speedy rehabilitation of road connectivity.
“We [government] will ensure that those whose houses were destroyed are provided with new homes, while the compensation covers livestock losses. Also, businessmen will be supported with a comprehensive relief package,” he said.
The chief minister said in addition to the already allocated Rs3 billion, Rs2 billion was released to strengthen ongoing relief and rehabilitation efforts in the flood-affected areas.
While responding to the urgent needs of various departments and the pressing requirement for rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by the recent floods, the cabinet approved a supplementary grant of Rs20 billion, according to an official statement.
It added that the funds would be utilised for fast-moving and near-completion projects across the province to ensure fast completion.
The cabinet sanctioned financial assistance for victims of the recent floods, approving Rs2 million for each deceased and Rs0.50 million for each injured besides approved the release of Rs1 billion (initially) to Provincial Disaster Management Authority for the launch of the “Food Stamp” initiative under which Rs15,000 would be provided to each flood-affected family.
It approved Rs180.300 million as a one-time special grant to KP Police for the families of Shuhada and for injured police personnel besides approved Shuhada package for the five martyred crew members of the helicopter crash in Mohmand during Bajaur air relief operation.
In view of the forthcoming holy month of Rabi-ul-Awal, the cabinet approved the sanction and release of Rs62.3 million as Grant-in-Aid for organising Seerat Conferences in Peshawar, divisional headquarters, and all districts of the province.
The cabinet approved exemption from the “release policy” for the financial year 2025-26 for the Peshawar High Court and granted it full access to the SAP system for posting funds to individual projects under the Law & Justice Sector, along with authority to carry out intra-sectoral re-appropriations, in line with last year’s practice.
It also granted approval to the financial assistance of Rs20 million in favour of Shaukat Yousafzai, former member of KP Assembly, for medical treatment.
The cabinet approved the transfer of two kanals of land in the name of relief, rehabilitation and resettlement department for the establishment of a Rescue 1122 station in Barang tehsil of Bajaur district and a non-ADP scheme amounting to Rs1.38 billion for the construction of Kumbar Bypass Road in Lower Dir district.
It also approved draft amendments to the KP Right to Public Service Act, 2014, and the appointment of chief commissioner to the KP Right to Public Service Commission and the nomination of two members for the Workers Welfare Board.

• Letter says CJP’s response, now in public domain, neither provides valid reason nor legal justification for not convening full court
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s decision to make public the minutes of the committee meeting held on Oct 31, 2024 — convened to call a full court session to determine the vires (validity) of the 26th Constitutional Amendment — has caused a considerable stir on the judicial front.
Two notes from Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi were  uploaded on the SC’s official website on August 14, reviving the debate  on 26th Amendment controversy.
On Wednesday, a letter surfaced from two senior judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. The letter appeared to be a response to the publication of the minutes of the three-judge committee formed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
The two judges had convened the committee meeting on Oct 31, last year and had formally requested CJP Afridi to constitute a full court to hear the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
The two notes from the CJP suggested that he had declined to implement the committee’s decision to place the constitutional challenges before the full court comprising all judges of the apex court, beca­use such a move could dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among the judges and further expose the court to public scrutiny.
However, in response to CJP’s explanation, both judges wrote a joint letter on Wed­nesday. In the letter, they wrote: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending, and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e., the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.
This was the most appropriate forum (in terms of composition) to resolve the fundamental constitutional issues in a manner that would not only satisfy the dictates of law and justice but also ensure a judicial decision whose legitimacy could not be questioned.”
Consensus
As a result, the court failed to develop an institutional response. The judges emphasised that this process could not be substituted by the CJP’s informal individual meetings with judges — especially when the other two committee members (the judges themselves) were neither involved in, nor invited to, these informal consultations.
In the letter, the judges wrote that they had made strenuous efforts to have a full court meeting convened — either through a sitting on the judicial side or at least an administrative meeting —to hear the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
At a time when no issue was more important for the court, a consensus was needed. That consensus, they stated, could only have been achieved in a manner consistent with the law and the court’s usual practice — through a full court meeting. Unfortunately, that consensus never emerged, the letter lamented.
“What was required,” the letter noted, “was collective deliberation and decision-making. That, regrettably, never took place. At a time when no question was more important for the court, a consensus should have been immediately sought through a full court meeting to enable the judiciary to respond institutionally.”
Such a response, they added, could only have come from the judges themselves — by convening in open court or in a full conclave. The dire consequences of not doing so, the letter warned, continue to reverberate through the court, the wider judiciary, and the entire constitutional framework.
The letter also expressed regret over the violation of the committee’s decision as it transitioned to a more formal phase. The Oct 31st meeting had been properly convened under the law, and the majority in attendance had made binding decisions reflected in the official minutes.
This decision, they wrote, was legally binding and could not be disregarded. When the challenges were not scheduled for hearing on Nov 4, 2024, as directed by the committee, the two judges wrote again — partly as a protest and certainly to ensure compliance. Unfortunately, this letter, too, was disregarded.
The judges reiterated that a binding decision of the committee had not been implemented. They stated they had thoroughly examined both notes of the CJP — now available in the public domain — and concluded that they neither provided a valid reason nor legal justification for non-compliance. “Had the full court been timely convened, as required by law,” they emphasised, “the entire matter would have been deliberated appropriately.”
Regarding the meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the judges observed that neither of the CJP’s two notes had been shared with other committee members. One of the notes was merely read aloud by the CJP at the JCP meeting on Nov 5, 2024.
The judges argued that the JCP was not the appropriate forum for addressing this issue, nor could the committee’s Oct 31 decision have been referred to the constitutional bench or any related committee on either Oct 31 or Nov 5, as such entities did not exist at that time.
Moreover, they said, those entities lacked the jurisdiction to override or nullify a lawful decision taken by the committee.
“We reiterate that on both of those dates,” the judges wrote, “the only legally binding decision in effect was that of the committee on Oct 31, which ought to have been fully implemented in both letter and spirit. Regrettably, this was never done.”
Finally, the judges addressed the public release of the committee’s minutes and related documents on the SC’s website. “Since the minutes and record have now been uploaded, despite the committee’s previous directive against doing so, and are irreversibly in the public domain,” the judges wrote, “we now require that this letter also be placed on the website alongside the record and materials related to the Oct 31 meeting.”
“If this is not done immediately,” the letter concluded, “this communication may be placed in the public domain through other appropriate means. And if, ultimately, it is now for History to judge — then let the record, at the very least, be complete.”

Speaking to media here, the Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, said that sustainable peace
in the province requires collective efforts and public cooperation. He said that following arrest of a key suspect in Quetta, the scope of investigations has been expanded.
He said that security agencies had received intelligence regarding certain target killers, which led to raids at multiple locations in the province. Several suspects were taken into custody during these operations.

According to the spokesperson, a lawyer was also detained along with other suspects during one of the raids, but he was released after preliminary investigations cleared him of any wrongdoing. He said that security forces’ actions are ongoing to maintain law and order across Balochistan.
 
 

“We have already made it clear that operations are being conducted in grey areas, where identifying adversaries is not easy,” he said.
He further said that peace and stability cannot be achieved by security forces alone and it requires joint efforts from all sections of society.
“No innocent person will be wronged, as questioning and investigations are part of the legal process,” he added.
The provincial government, Mr Rind said, will continue its efforts to restore peace and security in the province.

• PM, army chief interact with flood-hit people in Buner
• Shehbaz blames ‘human blunder’ of unregulated construction for worsening rain destruction
• Tells Centre & provinces to join hands on disaster, reforestation, and construction policies
• Over 20 killed as rains lash Karachi, Gilgit-Baltistan
BUNER: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday directed federal and provincial authorities to formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones, as he blamed the unregulated construction in “hazardous areas” for an increase in the damages caused by floods.
He made these remarks during his visit to Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where he addressed the flood victims and promised to utilise all resources for their relief and rehabilitation. The premier described floods, triggered by heavy rains and mountain torrents carrying rocks and debris, as “a doomsday of sorts” for the affected communities.
“More than 350 of our brothers and sisters have lost their lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone, while nationwide, over 700 lives have been claimed by this tragedy,” he said, adding that hundreds remained injured or missing.
 


Meanwhile, more than 20 people were killed on Wednesday in a torrential spell of monsoon rain across the country, as downpours have swept away entire villages over the last week, leaving more than 400 dead, AFP reported.
The KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said that the death toll from the floods across the province surged to 385, while 182 others were injured. It said Buner recorded the highest number of 228 deaths, while Swabi recorded 41 deaths.
Recalling the catastrophic floods of 2022, PM Shehbaz stressed that lessons had not been learned, particularly regarding construction in hazardous areas. He criticised the building of hotels and houses on riverbanks and floodplains, terming it a “human blunder” that had worsened the scale of destruction.
“There is no law anywhere in the world that allows construction in such dangerous places,” he said, warning that further spells of heavy rains were expected before September 10.
 
 

The PM directed federal and provincial authorities to immediately formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones. He said he would convene a meeting of all chief ministers and their chief secretaries to make joint decisions on disaster preparedness, reforestation, and regulation of construction.
“If we continue to allow influence and corruption to dictate building permits, then neither the people nor the governments will be forgiven,” he remarked.
Relief measures
He also announced emergency relief measures, including the restoration of electricity in flood-affected districts. He said 37 of the 47 damaged feeders in Buner and Swat had already been made functional and ordered that electricity supply be provided for one week, regardless of the bill payment history. He added Gilgit-Baltistan and KP were also being repaired on priority.
 
 

Emphasising the role of deforestation in worsening the floods, the prime minister urged strict action against indiscriminate tree-cutting in KP. “If the trees had remained, they would have helped hold back water and rocks,” he said, calling for a ‘national movement’ to stop deforestation and protect natural resources.
He lauded the efforts of the KP government, the Pakistan Army under Field Marshal Asim Munir, civil administration, and local relief organisations in assisting victims. He highlighted the dual challenge of external threats and natural disasters faced by the country, praising security forces for their service.
He also announced civil awards for public servants, such as Zahoor Ahmed, a teacher who lost his life while rescuing children during the floods.
Concluding his visit, the PM urged unity and collective responsibility in the face of recurring climate disasters. “Our limited resources must be spent wisely, on education, health, and sustainable infrastructure, not on repairing preventable destruction again and again,” he said.
A statement issued regarding his visit quoted the PM as saying that Pakistan must act as “a hard state where no one is above law” and necessary actions be taken against defaulters without distinction.
The statement said the premier and army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir received a comprehensive briefing on the ongoing rescue and relief operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The COAS also interacted with troops, police and civil administration personnel involved in rescue efforts, lauding their selfless commitment in assisting victims of floods and torrential rains. He directed ground formations to approach this responsibility with devotion and spare no effort in alleviating the hardships of flood-affected families.

This initiative marks a key milestone in the ongoing development of Pakistan’s financial market infrastructure.
The launch event, held at the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), was attended by CEOs of banks, microfinance institutions, payment system operators, payment service providers, senior SBP officials, and other industry stakeholders.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed highlighted that PRISM+ aligns with the central bank’s Vision 2028, aiming to bolster Pakistan’s digital financial infrastructure. With PRISM+, Pakistan joins a select group of countries adopting the ISO 20022 global messaging standard for both retail and large-value payment systems.
Built on advanced standards, PRISM+ offers enhanced functionality, including structured financial messaging, improved interoperability, and greater transparency.
The system also introduces innovative features such as real-time liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, future-dated payments, and seamless integration with the Central Securities Depository (CSD) for auctions, repos, and monetary operations.

Addressing the Auto Parts Summit 2025, organised by the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Mr Akhtar outlined a vision for a thriving domestic automotive industry.
“The new tariff policy coupled with a new industrial policy and regulatory reforms, along with the plan to revive certain sick industries such as the steel mills, will prove that the future of Pakistan’s automotive industry is bright,” he said. He assured local manufacturers that the government would stand by them, adding, “But we want you to be competitive, and we will help you.”
In a move to level the playing field, the SAPM assured auto parts makers that quality standards applicable to local manufacturing will also be strictly implemented on imported parts and vehicles.
However, industry stakeholders voiced significant concerns over government policies they see as detrimental to local enterprise. Paapam Chairman Usman Malik highlighted the challenges posed by the commercial import of used cars, arguing it undermines the local industry.

Local parts makers decry used car imports

He pointed out the apparent contradiction in the government’s approach, which promotes an environmentally friendly electric vehicle policy while simultaneously allowing the import of used petrol and diesel engine cars.
Mr Malik warned that such imports threaten to “destroy” local auto parts manufacturers, who currently supply 70pc of parts for cars and 90pc for motorcycles. He stressed that this would also negatively impact local employment.
Despite these challenges, the domestic auto parts industry demonstrates considerable potential, with annual exports reaching around $200 million, according to Mr Malik. He noted that these locally manufactured parts adhere to international safety standards, and that Pakistan’s Millat Tractors are being exported to the US.

An article in the Washington Post described America’s recent thaw with Islamabad as unexpected, amid a sharp deterioration in relations with New Delhi.
When Trump won reelection in November, many in Pakistan braced for a rough ride. In his first term, he had openly favoured India, castigating Pakistan for “deceit” and sheltering “terrorists”.
Yet six months into his second term — and after the most serious India Pakistan flareup in decades — the tables appear to have turned.
Trade spats and a personal falling out with Narendra Modi have pushed US India ties into crisis, while Pakistan has edged into Washington’s good books, WaPo noted.
In August, a frustrated Trump criticised India’s oil purchases from Russia, slapping 50pc tarrifs on New Delhi and launching a fierce rebuke: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Islamabad secured a 19pc tariff rate — low by regional standards, and far beneath the 50pc levy slapped on India.
Trump has also boasted of joint plans to explore Pakistan’s oil, while Pakistani officials have pitched cryptocurrency ventures and access to rare minerals.
 
 

Behind the scenes, Islamabad has hired Javelin Advisors, led by longtime Trump associates George A Sorial and Keith Schiller, and cultivated family networks.
World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm backed by the Trump family, signed a letter of intent with Pakistan’s Crypto Council in April; the visiting US delegation included Zachary Witkoff, son of real estate developer Steve Witkoff, now Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.
But some former officials worry that Pakistan’s leadership has been blinded by its recent successes and is not attuned to the risks. “Flattery is not a strategy — it’s not long-term,” warned Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.
According to WaPo, the army, widely viewed as Pakistan’s ultimate power broker, took charge of the outreach, dispatching Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington during inauguration week to soothe Congress.
Still, there are ambitions in Islamabad to lock in gains — notably access to American defence kit from attack helicopters to naval hardware. “We can’t go back to the golden years of the 1950s,” said former ambassador Masood Khan, “but we can build a paradigm that benefits both the United States and Pakistan.”

This summer, three provinces controlled by the three major political parties have borne the brunt of a major rain-related emergency, and none is in a position to accuse the other of not having done enough to prepare their province for the calamity.
The clear fact is that Pakistan is facing accelerating climate change impacts and needs to think outside of conventional frameworks in order to build resilience and preparedness. The monsoon is intensifying, glaciers are melting, near catastrophic heatwaves are becoming more and more frequent. This is not political theatre. It is a dire and urgent new reality opening up before us with rising ferocity. The first thing to shed is the reflex to politicise these catastrophes, because that literally does nothing to help.
 
 

The three governments — in KP, Punjab and Sindh — have just faced unusually strong rain events. But notice how turning these calamities into opportunities for political point-scoring has backfired spectacularly. When Punjab was inundated in July, for instance, the PTI lawmakers in the provincial assembly held what they called a ‘people’s assembly’ outside the building in protest against the suspension of their colleagues. So far so good. Politics and theatre are cousins after all.
But some among them took the opportunity to skewer the provincial government for the rain-related devastation in the province. Three among them were named in a report carried by this newspaper, and their criticism of the government of Maryam Nawaz took aim at the floods caused by the rains. Crops and farmland were destroyed, they shouted, homes caved in, and “development projects” showcased by the Punjab government were “washed away”. Yet the government “remains indifferent”, according to the report.

There is much that each provincial government needs to do to increase preparedness for the natural disasters hitting the country.

The need and desire of the opposition to protest stridently in Punjab is understandable, given the suspensions that their colleagues have been served. Those that kept the focus on the politics of suppression their party is facing had a clear message. But those that veered and tried to use a natural calamity for political point-scoring were in for a nasty surprise only a few days later when the province run by their own party — KP — was hit by an even larger rain-related calamity.
 
 

All the criticism they had levelled at the Punjab government was now washed away as the devastation in KP was larger by order of magnitude to what Punjab had seen. If we keep only a political lens when viewing these disasters, who do we blame for the devastation in KP?
Pretty soon, officials from both provinces were bickering over the meaning of the word ‘cloudburst’. Both provinces had ascribed their devastation to a ‘cloudburst’. In Punjab, they pointed to Chakwal, and in KP, they said Buner had seen a ‘cloudburst’. Then the Met Office weighed in, reminding both that the word ‘cloudburst’ refers to a very specific event and no such event had been seen in Chakwal or Buner, and urged them both to refrain from using this word to describe the cause of their respective devastation.
Why this insistence on ‘cloudburst’? Because cloudbursts are nearly impossible to forecast, and attributing rain disaster to them gets officialdom off the hook for having been unprepared. This is why it is now almost routine for provincial governments to use this word when explaining rain-related calamities in their province.
 
 

At the time of writing, Karachi is bracing for a second round of intense rain; the first left the city flooded on Tuesday, following more than 200mm of rain in a 12-hour period. The flooding was bad, but the drainage was better. I’m old enough to remember when smaller rain events in 1991 or 2006 left the city flooded for days on end. This time, as in 2020 or 2022, they cleared it within hours. So far, so good.
But the question remains: what prevents faster real-time drainage to keep flooding from become as dire as it does in the first place? The foremost expert on the disaster that is Karachi’s urban planning, Arif Hasan, has a good interview with that intrepid podcaster Shehzad Ghias in which he explains how overdevelopment on three main drainage channels is a major contributor to the flooding.
There is much that each provincial government needs to do to increase preparedness for these disasters that are hitting the country with growing intensity and frequency. And it all begins with superior weather forecasting capabilities. Without this, we are flying blind into a storm.
A former chief meteorologist of the country has an important contribution here. In a report in this paper, he is quoted as saying that Pakistan has 85 automatic weather stations around the country to cover more than 700,000 square kilometres of its land mass. According to the World Meteorological Organisation guidelines, there should be one for every 100 square kilometres of flat terrain, and 50 sq km of hilly terrain. This means we are short by factors of thousands in terms of our ability to monitor threats emanating from the weather.
 
 

With this critical weakness we will forever fumble in the dark as the weather turns increasingly hostile. And the resultant calamities will forever be sublimated only through political blaming and point-scoring, getting us nowhere.
A warning sign came around a decade ago when Pakistan experienced five massive floods in five years. Once more, nature is warning that politics alone will not save us.
Three floods in one summer in three provinces controlled by each major political party is a clear enough sign that scoring political points in the middle of natural calamities is the lowest form of politics in the country today. Those who engage in this behaviour are the same as those who in years past tried to score political points via fuel price hikes or ex­­change rate adjustments. It is time to grow up.

Nato military leaders had a “great, candid discussion” during a video conference on the results of recent talks surrounding the conflict in Ukraine, the chair of the alliance’s military committee said on Wednesday.
“On #Ukraine, we confirmed our support. Priority continues to be a just, credible and durable peace,” Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone wrote in a post on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, a small group of military leaders is continuing discussions in Washington to work out options for security guarantees for Ukraine, a Western official told Reuters on Wednesday, shortly after a bigger virtual meeting wrapped up. The source said US General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was holding the talks that also involved around half a dozen other Nato chiefs of defence.

Russia says it must be part talks on security guarantees

The Western official said there were no results yet since the topic of security guarantees had not been discussed in detail at a video conference of all Nato chiefs of defence earlier in the day.
The source expected further meetings of the chiefs of defence in the broader format to be called, in order to discuss any options worked out in the smaller group.
No time frame has been set for discussions as the final decision will lie with political leaders, the official said.
Few details leaked on the virtual meeting of military chiefs from Nato’s 32 member countries. But on Tuesday evening, Dan Caine held talks with European military chiefs on the “best options for a potential Ukraine peace deal,” a US defence official told AFP.
US President Donald Trump brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders to the White House on Monday, three days after his landmark encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
Trump, long a fierce critic of the billions of dollars in US support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, earlier said European nations were “willing to put people on the ground” to secure any settlement. He ruled out sending US troops but suggested it would provide air support instead.
But while Trump said Putin had agreed to meet Zelensky and accept some Western security guarantees for Ukraine, Kyiv and Western capitals have responded cautiously, as many of the details remain vague.
Russia wants in
Russia said on Wednesday it had to be part of any discussion on security guarantees for Ukraine and downplayed the likelihood of an imminent summit with Zelensky, tempering hopes for a quick peace deal.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that “seriously discussing security guarantees without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere”.
Lavrov also cast doubt on an imminent meeting between the sworn enemies, saying that any summit between Putin and Zelensky “must be prepared in the most meticulous way” so it does not lead to a “deterioration” of the situation surrounding the conflict.

He now appears highly optimistic about being able to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine soon to bring to an end the bloody conflict between the two countries — “…if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons”, the American leader told the media ahead of the meeting he hosted for the leaders of Ukraine and seven European countries at the White House.
One of Trump’s campaign promises was to end the war that began more than three and a half years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine. But resolving one of the largest conflicts to have occurred in recent years may not be as easy as Trump thinks. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed so far on both sides in the conflict, which has virtually turned it into a European war. The Russian invasion was seen as the most serious security threat to the entire West and has united Europe more than at any other time in recent history.
America, too, was one of the largest suppliers of arms to Ukraine before Trump broke away from the ranks, hugely weakening the anti-Russia alliance. His initial efforts failed to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire. The terms of peace were too vague to be accepted by either side.
While Moscow is not willing to cede the territories it has occupied during the war and accept Nato’s presence in the region, Ukraine is not prepared to make any compromise on its sovereignty. The trust gap is too wide to be bridged. Trump’s threat to completely stop America’s arms supply to Ukraine will not work as Europe stands solidly behind the country. In fact, European military support for Kyiv has increased significantly in recent months.

The Alaska meeting has cemented the rapprochement between Russia and the US.

Meanwhile, Russia intensified its military offensive, occupying more territories over the past few months. It was apparent that even the multiple sanctions clamped on it by the US and its Western allies failed to deter Moscow. Some reports suggest that Russia has not only recouped its military losses but has also expanded its military capabilities. Russia has reportedly lost 250,000 soldiers so far, but even such a large number of casualties has not affected its war efforts.
After an initial setback, Trump has revived peace efforts in recent weeks. He sent his special envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow earlier this month to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting took place days before Trump’s deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face economic sanctions. The three-hour meeting with Putin proved very productive. A White House official said the meeting went well and that Russia was eager to continue engaging with the US. The Moscow parleys paved the way for a Trump-Putin summit soon after.
 
 

Last week, the US president met his Russian counterpart for the first time since 2019. Trump welcomed Putin back on the world stage with a red carpet welcome when he landed in Alaska. It was Trump’s typical style of diplomacy. It was a remarkable moment for the Russian leader who was spurned by Western nations after Moscow launched the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin’s international travel has since been largely limited to nations friendly to Russia. The International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest on war crime charges.
The Alaska summit failed to produce a ceasefire agreement, as was expected by Trump, but was seen as a victory for Putin. His grand welcome on American soil was beyond expectations. Within a moment, Putin has gone from being a pariah in the West to a partner and friend of the US. The meeting ended earlier than expected without any agreement, yet Trump appeared satisfied.
In post-summit comments, Trump asserted that ‘great progress’ was made in the talks. But he did not share any details on the question of whether any concrete steps were being taken to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. There was no mention of any of the ‘severe consequences’ that Trump had threatened would follow if a ceasefire was not reached. Putin made it clear that Moscow was not willing to initiate an immediate ceasefire as demanded by the US and European leaders. There were also some reports that Russia would require Ukraine to give up some of its territory in exchange for ending the violence.
There may not be any tangible agreement on peace in Ukraine but the Alaska meeting has certainly cemented the rapprochement between Russia and the US. Both leaders agreed to continue the peace process. In his comments at the press talk, Putin made no promises, no concessions and no compromises. He appeared to be in full command of the situation.
Before wrapping up his remarks, he referenced one of the American president’s frequent talking points — that the conflict in Ukraine would have never started had Trump been in power then. It seemed the comment was enough to massage Trump’s ego. Putin looked at Trump and said in English: “Next time in Moscow.” Caught by surprise, Trump replied “Oh, that’s an interesting one.”
 
 

Days after the Alaska summit Trump hosted a round-table meeting for the Ukrainian president and seven other European leaders at the White House. The major concern of the European leaders is Ukraine’s security. They want security guarantees that oblige members to defend an ally under attack, meaning that Ukraine should be provided with similar protection even without formal Nato membership. They argue that a security agreement should be made a part of any peace deal. Russia has made it very clear that it will not accept any Western security cover for Ukraine that would threaten its own security.
Notwithstanding Trump’s desire to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which he believes will earn him a place in heaven besides winning him a Nobel Peace Prize, there is little hope of his wishes materialising at least in the near future.

Rain-related disasters have been witnessed elsewhere in Pakistan as well, particularly KP and GB, with hundreds of deaths reported in the former. But Karachi’s issues of urban flooding are unique in many ways, exacerbated by bad planning and unchecked growth. The mayor has attributed the disaster to ‘climate change’.
 
 

While the latter phenomenon has indeed contributed to erratic weather patterns, global warming alone is not the key culprit responsible for Karachi’s rain-related plight — by now, a grim annual spectacle — as soon as the monsoon clouds arrive.
Flooded streets, people trapped on roads for hours and lack of electricity for long periods during stifling weather conditions were some of the outcomes of Tuesday’s wet spell. Indeed, many parts of the city received a high volume of precipitation, but even less intense rain spells have previously brought the wheels of urban life to a grinding halt.
Disturbing visuals of motorists and bikers trapped on thoroughfares resembling raging torrents, and water entering houses and apartment blocks show that something is seriously wrong with Karachi’s drainage system. And the fixes applied to the problem do not seem to be working.
For example, a drainage system, reportedly costing hundreds of millions of rupees, was installed in the upmarket DHA area, but failed to stop flooding in the neighbourhood. DHA is controlled by a cantonment board, beyond the jurisdiction of civilian agencies. People living in low-income, low-lying areas were similarly affected.
 
 

From the august Supreme Court and independent urban experts to people venting their rage on social media — all have expressed their dismay over the fact that Karachi lacks a proper drainage system, and that the monsoon-related destruction is repeated year after year.
The fact is that the problem has been decades in the making, and it would be unfair to blame the present government alone. Successive administrations have neglected Karachi or paid lip service to its civic issues, as encroachers and land grabbers have steadily disfigured its face. Karachi’s urban issues, including the faulty drainage, are complex, and decades of neglect cannot be undone in weeks or months.
But a start must be made somewhere and the key problems of the city, primarily solid waste disposal, provision of water, a working sewerage system, fair land management, etc, which are all intertwined, must be addressed by the city’s managers and independent experts.
Moreover, a better LG system, which responds to local issues promptly and is answerable to the people, is essential to resolve Karachi’s civic woes, as multiple agencies controlling land in the city also complicates civic governance.

The finance division issued a notification suggesting the withdrawal of a directive for cabinet members to donate a month’s salary.
However, another notification from the same division stated that the one-day pay of senior bureaucrats from Grades 19 to 22 will be donated to the flood victims.
Meanwhile, officials at the Prime Minister’s Office clarified that the decision to donate one month’s salary of cabinet members has not been withdrawn, and that their salaries will be donated to the flood-hit people through another notification issued by the cabinet division.
The cabinet division’s notification said: “The prime minister has been pleased to direct that all federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers and special assistants to the prime minister shall contribute one month’s salary for flood relief.”
A senior official at the Prime Minister’s Office said the apparent contradiction stemmed from the fact that the finance division deals with the salaries of bureaucrats, while the cabinet division oversees the salaries and perks of cabinet members.
 
 

“Although the finance division’s notification gave the impression that the prime minister’s announ­ce­ment had been withdrawn, ministers will definitely donate their monthly pay to the flood victims,” the official said.
Another notification from the finance division clarified that contributions would be calculated on gross pay and allowances before deductions and would not be included in the taxable emoluments of officers and officials.

The approval of the E1 project, which would bisect the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, was announced last week by Smotrich and received final go-ahead from a defence ministry planning commission on Wednesday, he said.
Restarting the project could further isolate Israel, which has watched some Western allies frustrated by its continuation and planned escalation of the Gaza war announce they may recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.
“With E1 we are delivering finally on what has been promised for years,” Smotrich, an ultra-nationalist in the ruling right-wing coalition, said in a statement. “The Palestinian state is being erased from the table, not with slogans but with actions.”

Approves strategy to conquer Gaza City, calls up reservists

The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the announcement on Wednesday, saying that the E1 settlement would isolate Palestinian communities living in the area and undermines the possibility of a two-state solution.
British foreign minister David Lammy said on Wednesday that the widely condemned Israeli settlement plan would, if implemented, constitute a breach of international law and risk dividing a future Palestinian state.
“If implemented, it would divide a Palestinian state in two, mark a flagrant breach of international law and critically undermine the two-state solution,” Lammy said in a post on X, calling on the Israeli government to reverse the decision.
 






A German government spokesperson commenting on the announcement told reporters on Wednesday that settlement construction violates international law and “hinders a negotiated two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank”.
 
 

The two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict envisages a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, existing side by side with Israel.
Western capitals and campaign groups have opposed the settlement project due to concerns that it could undermine a future peace deal with the Palestinians.
The plan for E1, located adjacent to Maale Adumim and frozen in 2012 and 2020 amid objections from the US and European governments, involves construction of about 3,400 new housing units.
Infrastructure work could begin within a few months, and house building in about a year, according to Israeli advocacy group Peace Now, which tracks settlement activity in the West Bank.
Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law.
Plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza City
Meanwhile, Israel’s defence minister approved a plan on Wednesday for the conquest of Gaza City and authorised the call-up of around 60,000 reservists, piling pressure on Hamas as mediators push for a ceasefire.
Defence Minister Israel Katz’s move, confirmed to AFP by a spokesperson, came as mediators awaited an official Israeli response on their latest proposal.
While mediator Qatar had expressed guarded optimism over the latest proposal, a senior Israeli official said the government stood firm on its call for the release of all prisoners in any agreement.
The framework that Hamas had approved proposes an initial 60-day truce, a staggered prisoner release, the freeing of some Palestinian prisoners and provisions allowing for the entry of aid into Gaza.
On the ground in Gaza City on Wednesday, Mustafa Qazzaat, head of the emergency committee in the Gaza municipality, described the situation as “catastrophic”.
He told AFP that “large numbers” of people were fleeing their neighbourhoods, with the majority of those displaced “on the roads and streets without shelter”.

The Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources, chaired by Senator Shahadat Awan, reviewed the compliance reports on audit paras concerning Wapda. The committee expressed serious concerns over the decades-long unresolved legal cases, disputes related to land worth trillions, and the stalled Neelum-Jhelum project.
Senator Awan, while opening the proceedings, pointed out from the record that some of the Wapda cases had been pending for 21 years, and the organisation had not paid attention to these cases for the last sixteen years. He informed the committee colleagues that Wapda was occupying land valued at Rs10bn, while cases exceeding Rs298.48bn were pending in courts, primarily concerning Mangla Dam lands.
Mr Awan also raised alarm over the “illegal contract of Nai Gaj Dam worth Rs30 billion”, which remained under investigation by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). He asked the newly inducted Wapda Chairman, retired Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed, to call an immediate meeting on all these audit cases, and a report on the progress of all these cases should be presented to the committee. The committee called for the swift resolution of such long-drawn cases.

Senators slam ‘grave’ inefficiency, demand urgent action

Other members of the panel also echoed similar concerns. “It seems that Wapda’s legal team is not working”, remarked Senator Faisal Rahman while questioning the lack of progress on longstanding disputes.
In response, Wapda Chairman Saeed informed the committee that he had been in office for only ten days and had already convened three meetings to address these issues. He conceded that Wapda had many cases for which no record was available “but we are trying to reduce the backlog”. He also conceded that Wapda’s records were not digitised but assured the committee that digitisation efforts were underway.
Defending Wapda, Mr Saeed said it was not that Wapda was occupying any property. He said the Wapda had already paid compensation to people affected by Mangla Dam, and now they were pursuing cases in courts.
On the issue of NAB references, Wapda officials confirmed that six cases were currently under NAB’s purview, including two of Kachhi Canal and two of Nai Gaj Dam. The Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources added that these NAB cases were against individuals and not against Wapda, distancing the ministry from direct responsibility.
The Senate Committee, however, insisted on accountability and called the Federal Investigation Agency and Nab to the next meeting for the other side of the cases and directed Wapda and the Ministry of Water Resources to present complete details of all cases. “If any government agency has taken responsibility, then it is our job to enquire,” Senator Awan emphasised.
While discussing the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project, senators voiced concern over its closure following the collapse of the headrace tunnel last year. Officials briefed that the project had earlier faced a tailrace tunnel collapse, which was repaired, allowing operations for nine months before the new breakdown.
Senator Shahadat Awan, however, deferred a detailed briefing on the subject, saying that the Prime Minister had already formed a committee to probe into the project and fix responsibility. Therefore, the committee should wait for the inquiry report before further discussion, he said. Accordingly, the committee postponed the briefing until the completion of the inquiry.
The Standing Committee directed that Wapda’s legal team should immediately coordinate with the Auditor General of Pakistan and the Ministry of Law to resolve audit-related cases from 2015-16 and all criminal and PAC-related cases be reported in detail in the next sitting.

Power was nearly restored across the city, and only a few roads had remained inundated after Tuesday’s heavy downpour before a late evening spell of heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds on Wednesday interrupted Karachiites’ hopes for a quick return to normalcy.
The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed on Wednesday, after Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab declared a rain emergency.
Notifications issued on Wednesday by the Sindh government’s college and school education departments stated that schools will remain closed today due to the heavy rain. The notices are available with Dawn.com.
The government notified that the closure will apply to all private and public institutions in Karachi division, which are under the administrative control of the Sindh government’s College Education Department and School Education and Literacy Department.
Later on Wednesday night, Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) also issued a notification stating it would remain closed today due to heavy rainfall in the metropolis.
“All scheduled examinations stand postponed. The revised dates will be announced in due course of time through official notification,” the notice, available with Dawn.com, read.
“However, the services of Dow Diagnostic Reference and Research Laboratory, Dow Institute of Radiology, Dr Ishratul Ebad Khan Institute of Blood Diseases, Dow University Hospital, Ojha Campus, Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre, Dow University Road (NIPA Hospital) and Dow International Dental College Hospital (Gulistan-i-Johar) shall continue to operate as per the holiday roster, ensuring the continuation of essential services and rain-emergency duties.”
The notification added that postgraduate trainees at Dr Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital, Karachi and Dow University Hospital would follow the holiday roster.
Three children were among four more people killed in rain-related incidents in Karachi on Wednesday evening, raising the death toll to 14 as the metropolis was lashed with heavy rainfall for a second consecutive day.
By 8pm, Orangi Town had recorded the heaviest showers, receiving 37 millimetres in total from the two spells. The PAF Faisal Base on Sharea Faisal followed with 32mm, while Jinnah Terminal measured 18mm. Keamari received 13mm, and the Airport Old Area saw 11mm of rainfall. Other parts of the city experienced lighter showers, including Korangi with 6.8mm, the Met Office station on University Road with 7.6mm, Nazimabad with 2mm, the PAF Masroor Base in Karachi West with 2mm, and Surjani Town with 1.8mm. Several areas, such as Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Gulshan-e-Maymar, Saadi Town, and Bahria Town, recorded negligible or no rain during this period.</p><small>2025-08-20 19:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21001110bbc3c27.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932049/death-toll-climbs-to-14-as-rain-batters-karachi-for-second-straight-day' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll climbs to 14 as rain batters Karachi for second straight day</strong></a><br><p>Three children were among four more people killed in rain-related incidents in Karachi on Wednesday evening, raising the death toll to 14 as the metropolis was lashed with heavy rainfall for a second consecutive day.
Tuesday’s rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupted industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet services outages which continued late into Wednesday, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery. Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration had anno­unced a public holiday in the city today.
 


An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said in a statement that two unidentified children drowned in the Lyari River in Liaquatabad’s C-1 Area and near Al-Asif Square in Sohrab Goth, while Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that their rescue team continued the search operation until nightfall, but it was halted due to darkness.
Separately, a young boy drowned while swimming in accumulated rainwater in a ditch off Northern Bypass, according to Gulshan-i-Maymar police Station House Officer (SHO) Abdul Ghaffar Korai.
“The body was recovered and sent to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital,” he said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body of an unidentified man in his early 60s who drowned was brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital by Site Superhighway Industrial Area police for legal formalities.
Meanwhile, Shah Faisal Colony police said that two young brothers were electrocuted in the area on Tuesday evening.
Shah Faisal Colony SHO Imtiaz Husain Shah told Dawn.com that one of the victims was electrocuted by an underground electric wire near Jamia Masjid Farooqia in Shah Faisal Colony - 4. His brother tried to rescue him, but he also suffered an electric shock and died. The victims were identified as Murad Sultan, 21 and Siraj Sultan, 12.
Shortly after 2:30pm, rainfall was reported in Saddar, Malir, Malir Cantonment, Scheme 33, Gulistan-i-Jauhar Block 2, and near I.I. Chundrigar, Kala Pull Road, and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC). Another spell dumped more rain on the city in the evening, triggering power outages even in areas where electricity had previously been restored.
By 8pm, Orangi Town had recorded the heaviest showers, receiving 37 millimetres in total from the two spells. The PAF Faisal Base on Sharea Faisal followed with 32mm, while Jinnah Terminal measured 18mm. Keamari received 13mm, and the Airport Old Area saw 11mm of rainfall. Other parts of the city experienced lighter showers, including Korangi with 6.8mm, the Met Office station on University Road with 7.6mm, Nazimabad with 2mm, the PAF Masroor Base in Karachi West with 2mm, and Surjani Town with 1.8mm. Several areas, such as Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Gulshan-e-Maymar, Saadi Town, and Bahria Town, recorded negligible or no rain during this period.
In an alert issued at 3pm, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had warned that rains with thunderstorms and strong winds were expected at most places in Karachi and its surrounding areas in the next two to four hours, while heavy showers were also forecast at some locations.
Warning of the risk of increased urban flooding, the PMD had advised the public to take necessary precautions and remain alert.
 






In a post on X, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab warned citizens: “It is expected to rain again from 2pm onwards. I would request people to avoid movement and if it starts to rain, please stay put where you are whether it is your office or residence.”
 






“We are expecting more intense rains,” Anjum Nazir, a spokesperson for Sindh’s meteorological department, as quoted as saying by Reuters.
NDMA warns of more rainfall
The NDMA’s National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday afternoon warned of heavy rainfall of 50-100 millimeters or more in parts of Sindh over the next 12 to 24 hours, highlighting the risk of urban flooding, waterlogging and disruptions to daily life.
A spokesman for the NDMA advised residents in vulnerable areas — including Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, and adjoining regions —to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
The NDMA said urban flooding was expected to persist in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
The authority warned that disruptions in power and telecom services were likely. Citizens were encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.
Electricity outages
In an update at 1:30pm, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said the company’s generation, transmission and distribution system was stable, with power supply continuing in the city through more than 2,000 of 2,100 feeders.
“As soon as rainwater drainage is completed and safety clearance is received from ground teams, the few remaining areas will also be restored soon,” he said, adding that the areas where power was being restored included Saima Pari Centre in Surjani Town; KDA Apartments; Hill View Apartments; Blocks A, C, D, I, J, K, R, and S in North Nazimabad; Block 10-A in Gulshan-i-Iqbal; Murtaza Chowrangi; Sector 21, and Sector 29 in Korangi, and Khyaban-i-Shamsheer, Shaheen, Gizri Boulevard and Commercial Street 1 to 4 in Defence Housing Authority.
“The public is urged to maintain safety precautions. Stay away from electrical installations and poles and exercise caution when using electrical appliances.
“In case of emergency complaints, contact the 118 call centre,” the spokesperson said.
 






In an update at 3:50pm, the Karachi Traffic Police said the following roads and underpasses were closed for traffic due to rainwater accumulation.
Shaheed-i-Millat Underpass at Tariq Road and Drigh Road Underpass towards the airport in District East; Nazimabad No. 1 and 2 underpasses, Liaqatabad No. 10 Underpass, Gharibabad Underpass and Sohrab Goth Underpass in District Central; both roads coming and going towards Qayyumabad at Korangi Crossing and both roads coming and going towards Korangi at EBM Causeway in Korangi District.
“The public is requested to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience and trouble. In case of any emergency, contact the traffic helpline 1915.”
 






The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed today, after Wahab declared a rain emergency. However, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah rebutted a “fake” notification of school closures for tomorrow and Friday, clarifying that the government had not issued any such directives yet.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah⁩ chaired a meeting on Karachi’s rain situation.
“More rain expected, municipal and emergency teams are on alert. Continuous efforts underway for drainage and rescue operations,” said a post on his X account. It noted that 26 de-watering pumps had been deployed citywide to “ease flooding”.
 






CM Shah also visited Sharea Faisal and the Nursery area, where he spoke to the media and highlighted that the effects of climate change were visible around the world.
“Rainwater accumulated in the city, but you can see that the nullahs are flowing,” he said, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“Did the nullahs get cleared within a night? No, the Sindh government had been working on it. But the media was saying that the city had drowned and the administration was not present, which is wrong.
“The entire city administration, municipality corporation’s staff, and I myself are on the streets,” the chief minister added.
State broadcaster PTV News uploaded a post to X stating that the Pakistan Army was continuing relief and rescue efforts in the wake of heavy rainfall in Karachi.
“Due to continuous rain, many vehicles were rescued with the help of [the] Pakistan Army’s relief vehicles,” the post said, adding that elderly people and children were shifted to safe locations by Pakistan Army personnel.
The post included a video showing army personnel working with civil personnel and towing stranded vehicles with heavy trucks.
 






Inundated roads as mayor stresses ‘climate change is a reality’
Floodwater was still accumulated on multiple roads across the city, including near I.I. Chundrigar Road, as Karachi did not witness any further rain till at least 2pm.
While the traffic police listed 10 bypasses and three main roads as being closed till at least 12pm due to urban flooding, Wahab presented a contrasting picture on his social media accounts, sharing videos of only those routes that were clear for vehicles.
The PPP mayor shared videos shot from inside a car of a drive along the Sher Shah Suri Road, Submarine Underpass, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Liaqatabad No. 10 leading to Daak Khana, which did not have any rainwater in the videos.
 

This Google Map screengrab shows road blockades across Karachi on Aug 20, 2025 as of 4:50pm, a day after heavy rainfall led to flooding in various areas.

In a post on X, Wahab urged citizens not to use Shaheed-i-Millat Road at the moment as “work is being carried out to clear the underpasses”. He suggested using Stadium Road or Shahrah-i-Quaideen as alternative routes.
 






Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Wahab said: “Climate change is a reality. If you want to make someone a target of criticism and say whatever you want, you can. But, you can see how huge a challenge climate change is for any government, state, or administration around the world.”
Noting that Pakistan faced “different challenges” from the developed countries, the PPP mayor said climate change had wreaked havoc in other parts of the country too in recent weeks.
He underscored that people had two options: either change their behaviour to combat climate change, or criticise others. He compared yesterday’s torrential rains in Karachi to those that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other northern areas and Islamabad faced this monsoon.
Wahab detailed that there were two rain spells on Tuesday, with the first one ending by 9:30am, allowing the city administration to work on removing the rainwater. “By 12:30pm, the situation had been fixed and the main arteries of your city were open.”
 
 

However, the second spell began at around 1:15pm and continued “non-stop” till 6pm, the PPP mayor highlighted. Even after that, rain continued “on and off” till around 8pm with each spell lasting 10 to 12 minutes, Wahab added.
Noting that 235 millimetres of rain occurred in only Manghopir in 12 hours yesterday, Wahab stressed that Karachi’s nullahs had a capacity of 40mm so rainfall above that would result in a spillover effect. He asserted that a nullah situated in the Nursery area was fully functional and had no blockage.
Rain started again while Wahab was holding the media talk, with the mayor saying he was ready to continue the press conference in the same outdoor setting, and later pushed back an umbrella someone else was holding for him.
According to the rainfall record issued by the PMD at 8am for the previous 24 hours, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rain (178mm), with Keamari following close (173mm).
Airport Old Area recorded 164mm of rain, Jinnah Terminal 156mm, Nazimabad 150mm, Surjani Town 151mm, North Karachi 149mm, Saadi Town 146mm, DHA Phase 7 138mm, Met Office at University Road 145mm, Korangi 139mm, PAF Faisal Base at Sharea Faisal 133mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar (Jamia Rasheed) 103mm, PAF Masroor Base (Karachi West) 101mm, Orangi Town 81mm and Bahria Town witnessed the lowest 5mm.
 






Deaths from rain-related incidents rise to 8
According to separate statements issued by Karachi Rescue 1122, two more people died in rain-related incidents, in addition to yesterday’s six deaths.
Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of a 50-year-old man, identified as Abbas Mohsin, who went missing in a nullah near the Gurumandir area yesterday, Rescue 1122 said. His body was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
 
 

In Defence Housing Authority’s (DHA) Phase 5, Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Yasir, after being informed about an electrocution incident. The man’s body was shifted to the JPMC.
A man and a woman were injured after part of an old building collapsed in the Ranchore Line area, a statement from the Edhi Rescue service said. Both were taken to CHK in an ambulance.
According to statements by Sindh Rescue 1122, “several people” were rescued from Karachi’s Sukhan Nadi, while 18 men and 12 women were evacuated safely from a call centre in PECHS Block 6 after they were trapped there due to rainwater accumulated inside the building.
Among the six people who died yesterday were four members of a family who lost their lives after the walls of a house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12 collapsed during the heavy rain. According to a JPMC statement, a boy aged between two to four years and a six to seven-year-old girl were among the deceased, while a fifth relative was injured.
In another similar incident in Orangi Town, an eight-year-old child lost his life. An unidentified man, aged 20-24 years, died in a suspected electrocution case in DHA’s Phase 7.
Yesterday’s rains severely flooded Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road, and I.I. Chundrigar Road, with hundreds of cars and motorcycles submerged and commuters stuck in traffic jams for several hours. Many had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district as they tried to return home.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept across the city, plunging several areas into darkness. Even upscale neigh­bourhoods, such as DHA and Clifton, were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the residents’ misery.
The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport were also affected, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to an alternative airport due to inclement weather.
More rains expected in Sindh, Balochistan
The PMD has forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
According to the PMD, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Karachi, Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar and Jamshoro.
Scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
 






In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.</p><small>2025-08-20 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/202306090c7019a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932099/india-test-fires-ballistic-missile-ahead-of-us-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>India test-fires ballistic missile ahead of US tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>India on Wednesday test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads, a government statement said, in an apparent show of strength ahead of a threatened US tariff increase.
The Agni-5 missile was successfully launched in India’s eastern Odisha state, with authorities saying it “validated all operational and technical parameters.”
The test-fire came a week before US tariffs are set to double from 25 per cent to 50 pc, unless India meets President Donald Trump’s demand that it stop buying Russian oil.
 
 

India last tested the Agni-5 missile in March 2024.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this month that, in the face of US tariffs, India was seeking self-reliance with energy independence and the development of its own defence systems.
New Delhi has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including in the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia as an apparent counter to rival China.
But India’s relations with China have warmed recently with several bilateral visits, and Modi is scheduled to visit Tianjin later this month in his first visit to the country since 2018.
Agni, meaning “fire” in Sanskrit, is the name given to a series of rockets India developed as part of a guided missile development project launched in 1983.

The letter, which has surfaced amid a brewing controversy, reveals a clash over judicial independence, transparency, and the handling of one of Pakistan’s most politically charged constitutional issues: the 26th Amendment, which alters judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate, with opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
The letter states that on October 31, 2024, Justices Shah and Akhtar, members of the Supreme Court Committee formed under the Practice and Procedure Act, 2023, had pushed for a Full Court hearing to address petitions challenging the amendment’s validity. They argued that only a collective adjudication by all judges could restore public faith in the institution, which was seen at the time to have been battered by political pressures.
However, CJP Afridi, citing informal, private consultations with other judges, insisted that the cases should be assigned to a Constitutional Bench — a body created under the very amendment that was under scrutiny.
In a dramatic turn, the two justices said they had convened a formal Practice and Procedures Committee meeting the same day, deciding by majority to schedule the petitions for November 4, 2024, before a Full Court. The decision was never complied with by the Registrar of the Supreme Court, even after a subsequent letter was issued to them.
The CJP, who skipped the meeting, later issued notes justifying his refusal to comply. The two notes from the CJP, recently uploaded to the Supreme Court’s website, suggest that he had declined to implement the committee’s decision because such a move could have dampened the “much-needed spirit of collegiality” among the judges and “further expose the court to public scrutiny”.
However, Justices Shah and Akhtar complain that these notes were never shared with the members of the Committee, but presented at a Judicial Commission meeting – a move that the justices believe was legally inappropriate. The Registrar’s failure to act on the Committee’s directive further escalated tensions, leaving the petitions unresolved nearly ten months later. The judges also stated that they had thoroughly examined both notes authored by the CJP — now available in the public domain — and concluded that they neither provided a valid reason nor legal justification for non-compliance with the Practice and Procedures Committee’s “legally binding” decision on October 31, 2024.
The letter also raises questions over the sudden public disclosure of the Committee’s minutes of the October 31 meeting on the Supreme Court website despite a prior decision to restrict their circulation. The letter suggests this may be linked to the upcoming resumption of Constitutional Benches in September 2025. The judges have also highlighted amendments to the Practice and Procedure Act that removed Justice Akhtar from the Committee, labelling it as an attempt to centralise power with the CJP.
The controversy comes at a critical juncture for Pakistan’s judiciary, already grappling with accusations of political interference. The 26th Amendment, passed in 2024, has previously been criticised by PTI and legal circles as an effort to block Justice Shah, the senior-most judge, from becoming CJP.
In light of the CJP’s explanations being uploaded, the two justices demanded that their letter, too, be placed on the Supreme Court website to ensure transparency, promising to release it publicly if ignored.
“The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending, and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e., the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.
“This was the most appropriate forum (in terms of composition) to resolve the fundamental constitutional issues in a manner that would not only satisfy the dictates of law and justice but also ensure a judicial decision whose legitimacy could not be questioned,” the letter regrets.</p><small>2025-08-20 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619683-karachi-weather-forecast-will-it-rain-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi weather forecast: Will it rain tomorrow?</strong></a><br><p>
