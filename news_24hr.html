He further said that the treaty still exists despite New Delhi holding it in abeyance “unilaterally and illegally”.
“The words ‘holding in abeyance’ used by India doesn’t exist anywhere in the law. Therefore, the Indus Water Treaty exist as it is, as these words cannot abolish it,” Mr Wattoo said while speaking at a seminar on Saturday.
“Holding the treaty in abeyance is absolutely illegal immoral. It is a violation of all international agreements,” the minister added.

Ex-Indus water commissioner warns China and other upstream countries may block flow of water to India

Talking about the background of the issue, the federal minister said the correspondence between the two countries were underway since 2024.
India wrote a letter to Pakistan, seeking some modification in the treaty under the Article 12 (3) of the treaty. Under the treaty, the minor issues related to water can be discussed and resolved on the level of commissioner of Indus waters representing Pakistan and India under Articles 8 to 11. But if the issues are more important, these can be discussed and resolved by both the parties, Pakistan and India.
“In its April 8 letter, they [India] sought us to tell the place where parties can sit and discuss the issue [related to modification]. In the letter, they also asked us to respond till May 8. But on April 24, India unilaterally suspended it,” he revealed, adding that holding treaty in abeyance doesn’t have any legal cover.
“The treaty cannot be held in abeyance or suspended unilaterally by anyone. It cannot be changed, modified, amended or cancelled by anyone. The treaty still exists.”
Mr Wattoo said Pakistan also wrote in response to India’s letter, stating to sit and discuss.
“We told them for holding negotiations on this, saying to reach results if we reach mutual understandings. But the aggression India did by taking action unilaterally is equal to act of war. The water is our lifeline and on this issue, we can neither compromise nor show any flexibility,” the minister warned.
“Currently, Pakistan is receiving normal flow of water from Indian side,” he said.
Talking about the canals issue in the country, Mr Wattoo said he wrote to all provinces to come forward and devise an action plan in this regard. “We have told the provinces to constitute a committee of independent experts and take a final decision mutually. In this way, the misunderstandings on the part of provinces would also be no more,” he maintained.
Former Indus water commissioner Asif Baig said that India had transboundary agreements on water with China, Nepal, Bangladesh and other neighbours. “Because China is sitting on upstream level from where water flows down to Indian located at downstream position. Similarly, in Pakistan case, India is on upstream location which is being bragged by Indian government. If India dubbing its upstream status as authority to stop water follow to Pakistan transgressing treaty, then what will happen if China and other upstream country block flow of water to India,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, former Indus Water commissioner,   Sheraz Memon said that even if India tried to block water flow toward Pakistan, it would be an exercise in futility due to the country’s insufficient capacity to water maneuverability.
“IWT survived in Pak-India two wars and barrage of terrorism allegations,” he said and suggested that sagacity demanded that treaty should go unaffected in all worst scenarios.
Former Punjab irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari categorically ruled out any one-sided suspension of IWT. He said if India was given liberty to do so, none of international treaties would stand exist and will lose their holistic merits.
“If India remains hell-bent on [stopping the flow of water coming to Pakistan], it will cost billions of dollars to build the infrastructure on rivers,” he added.

• Next review likely in second half of 2025
• Mission thanks federal, provincial authorities for constructive engagement
ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistani authorities have reached a preliminary agreement on a comprehensive financial framework, paving the way for continued negotiations on the budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Officials in the finance ministry indicate that discussions are set to advance in the coming days, with the goal of finalising crucial fiscal policies, including the revenue collection target for FY26, development outlay, defence expenditure, and the highly debated tariff rationalisation plan for the industry.
The areas where agreements remain pending include tax concessions for the salaried class, an increase in defence budget and policies related to real estate. The discussions will also focus on reducing expenditures, as well as continuing reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.
 
 

According to an IMF announcement, the Fund mission, led by Nathan Porter, has concluded its staff visit to Islamabad. The staff visit focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation and the budget strategy for FY26.
The IMF delegation arrived in Islamabad on May 19 to review Pakistan’s recent economic developments, assess progress under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), and initiate discussions on the next federal budget.
“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY26 budget proposals and broader economic policy and reform agenda, supported by the 2024 EFF and the 2025 RSF,” Mr Nathan said.
The next mission, associated with the upcoming EFF and RSF reviews, is expected in the second half of 2025.
Finance ministry officials reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in FY26.
It was stated that during the mission visit, discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and on prioritising expenditures.
 
 

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is facing significant shortfalls in the current fiscal year.
“We will discuss a realistic revenue target for the FBR while keeping in view real GDP growth and inflation,” tax officials said, adding that next year’s target will be based on actual revenue potential rather than setting an unrealistic goal.
“We will continue discussions towards agreeing on the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days,” Mr Nathan said.
He added that the discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector, along with other structural reforms to foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.
Mr Nathan also said that Pakistani authorities emphasised their commitment to ensuring sound macroeconomic policymaking and building financial buffers. In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to anchor inflation within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5-7pc.
At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, preserving a fully functioning forex market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are considered critical to strengthening resilience against external shocks.
The mission thanked the federal and provincial authorities for their hospitality, constructive discussions and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies. The announcement said the IMF team will remain engaged and continue its close dialogue with the authorities.

The launch took place during the National Consu­ltative Workshop on the Power Sector Indig­eni­sation Roadmap, organised by the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) — formerly known as the National Tran­smission and Despatch Company (NTDC) — in collaboration with the LUMS Energy Institute.
Speaking via video link, Energy Minister Awais Leghari said the government was finalising a plan to supply 7,000-megawatt electricity to Pakistan’s export industry at the most competitive tariff in the region. “We are working on providing electricity at a marginal cost to boost exports,” the minister said. He added that power sector indigenisation was vital to shifting the country from an import-dependent to an export-led economy.
The event brought together experts from the power sector, manufacturing industry, regulatory bodies, policymakers and academia to chart a cohesive national strategy for accelerating the localisation of Pakistan’s electrical power equipment manufacturing ecosystem.
Mr Leghari said the NGC was the first national entity to implement an approved Indigenisation Policy, and its strategic procurement model was already delivering tangible results.
He urged the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), power distribution companies (Discos), K-Electric and state-owned and private power generation plants to adopt indigenisation as a strategic imperative — not as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but as a core procurement principle aligned with the National Electricity Plan 2023-27.
 
 

The minister said the government was striving for an export-oriented economy instead of imports, and power sector indigenisation was the need of the hour. The power sector reforms were going on, the Independent System and Market Operator had been fully functional, and the Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company would also be made functional soon, he said.
The Power Equipment Manufacturing Dashboard — developed by the Lums Energy Institute with input from key stakeholders — was jointly inaugurated by NGC board Chairman Dr Fiaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Pakistan Engineering Council chairman Engr Waseem Nazir, NGC Managing Director Engr Muhammad Waseem Younas, K-Electric CEO Syed Monis Abdullah Alvi, and others.
Commenting on the dashboard, the federal minister said its launch would help indigenise the power sector.
On the occasion, Dr Fiaz stated that the NGC’s indigenisation strategy — anchored in policy reform and targeted educational orders — has already saved over $10 million in foreign exchange through import substitution.
Dr Fiaz, also a senior adviser at the Lums Energy Institute, reaffirmed that Lums would continue supporting policy design, digital innovation and institutional transformation in the energy sector.
He said that under the 10-year Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan and the Transmission System Expansion Plan, investment of $8 billion would be needed in the transmission sector. “We want this equipment and material to be manufactured in Pakistan, which will save valuable foreign exchange,” he said.
Mr Younas outlined the tangible progress under the Indigenisation Policy.
He said that since 2022, the NGC had placed over Rs2bn in local orders, including Rs781m in educational orders aimed at building industrial capacity.
Additionally, NGC’s revision of its Type Test Policy in 2023 to align with international benchmarks has opened the door for local manufacturers to compete globally.
The workshop concluded with consensus on actionable steps to align procurement practices with national localisation goals, foster technology partnerships, and create a clear roadmap for import substitution.

Downdetector, which mon­itors internet outages in real time, showed a spike in users’ complaints after 5pm. The tally pea­ked with 372 complaints at 5:36pm, with more than 600 complaints in total reported by late evening.
Users said they were unable to log in to their accounts and send tweets.
However, the number of complaints reduced by 8pm, indicating the restoration of services.
The Pakistan Telec­ommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways.”
“All other internet services across the country remain fully functional,” PTA said.
X was blocked in Pakistan on Feb 17, 2024, after allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections by a former bureaucrat. However, the platform was discreetly restored on May 7 after India fired missiles into Pakistan, resulting in a days-long conflict.
Prolonged disruption
The global internet observer NetBlocks has also confirmed the disruptions were global but not related to any country-level internet filtering.
Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
 






“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
The disruption came two days after a previous global outage, which affected the services of X for several hours on Thursday.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources.
The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.

As diplomats met in New York to prepare for an international conference in June, aimed at advancing global efforts towards achieving a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan called for addressing the root cause: Israel’s prolonged occupation.
“Only by ending the occupation can we secure a just and lasting peace,” Amb­assador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the preparatory session that brought together UN member states to finalise arrangements for eight roundtables.
“This conference is both timely and essential,” he said, pointing out that Palestinian people’s continued suffering, the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the systematic erosion of the two-state solution through illegal settlements and unilateral measures by the occupying power demand a resolute international response.
 



Amb Iftikhar spells out steps at preparatory session for June conference to preserve Palestinian statehood viability

The conference will take place at the UN headquarters in New York from June 17 to 20. It stems from a resolution approved by the UN General Assembly in December 2024 and will be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France.
In his remarks, he said in the lead-up to the June conference, it was imperative to restore and fully implement a ceasefire in Gaza, lift the blockade, ensure unimpeded humanitarian access, including through UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and protect civilians and aid workers.
“Any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians, annex territory, or impose militarised aid mechanisms must be firmly rejected,” he said.
Mechanism, transit corridor
To preserve the viability of Palestinian statehood, he said that, among other steps, the conference “must establish a mechanism to monitor and promote enforcement of relevant UNSC resolutions, including those which term settlements illegal and efforts made to secure Palestine’s admission as a full UN member state; and, operationalise the Gaza Reconstruction Plan endorsed by the OIC and Arab Group. Projects such as a Gaza-West Bank transit corridor, seaport reconstruction, and industrial zones are vital for territorial contiguity and Palestinian unity.”
 






He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian Question, rooted in international law and relevant UN resolutions, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds as the capital of Palestine.
“This conference must serve a turning point, and deliver tangible outcomes,” he told delegates. “Pakistan stands ready to support this conference and contribute to a credible political horizon, for a two-state solution — one that upholds Palestinian rights, ends occupation and delivers durable peace through a viable, sovereign Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he added.
Earlier, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang urged countries to seize the crucial opportunity to finally make progress.
 
 

“The horrors we have witnessed in Gaza for over 19 months should spur us to urgent action to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The devastating cycles of death, destruction, and displacement cannot be allowed to continue,” he said.
“This conflict cannot be resolved through permanent war, nor through endless occupation or annexation. It will only end when Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own sovereign, independent states, in peace, security and dignity.”

According to the Indian publication, the cancellation closely follows India’s recent move to withdraw the transhipment facility previously extended to Bangladesh to export its cargo to third countries — a development that analysts interpret as signalling strain in bilateral relations.
In a regulatory disclosure submitted to the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd and BSE Ltd under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Require­ments) Regulations, 2015, GRSE confirmed that the government of Bangladesh had cancelled the order, originally placed in July 2024.
The cancellation adds to a series of geopolitical developments since the change in political leadership in Bangladesh following the fall of prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government in August 2024. Observers note that ties between the two neighbours have become increasingly tense in recent months.
In a statement, GRSE also announced that it had emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of Next Generation Corvettes (NGC) for the Indian Navy.

• Road, air travel disrupted; walls and roofs collapse, infrastructure damaged
• Widespread outages reported from parts of country
• Crops, power lines damaged in KP; 113 feeders trip across province
ISLA­M­ABAD / LAHORE /PES­H­­­­­A­WAR: At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Heavy rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and hail also struck Islamabad, leading to water accumulation in several low-lying areas and trees falling at multiple spots.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, strong winds and hailstorms caused extensive damage to crops and power lines but no fatalities were reported. Over 113 power feeders tripped across the province, with areas like Peshawar, Mardan, Khyber, Swabi, Swat and Abbottabad worst affected.
Meanwhile, a private airline from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport.
 
 

According to the data provided by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Punjab and Rescue 1122, three people died each in Lahore and Jhelum, two each in Sialkot and Muzaffargarh and one person each in Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Attock, Multan, Rajanpur, Hafi­zabad, Mianwali, Jhang and Layyah as the walls and roofs of the houses collapsed and trees fell on them. About two dozen incidents of the fall of solar panels and billboards were also reported.
A PDMA tally issued at 10pm on Saturday put fatalities at 13 and injuries at 92. Separate incidents reported by Rescue 1122 and other sources added more deaths, pushing the toll higher.
The authority had earlier urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert, according to a . report.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across Punjab to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of the province, the authority said in a statement.
Motorway Police closed several motorways, including sections of M2, M3 and the Lahore-Sialkot route, due to safety concerns. Severe weather and low visibility were reported on parts of the M4 and M5, while thunderstorms disrupted travel across highways linking Lahore to Multan and beyond.
Power infrastructure was also hit hard, with Multan’s power utility Mepco confirming faults across south Punjab’s grid, leading to temporary blackouts in Multan, Khanewal, Vehari and Sahiwal.
The Water and Sanitation Agency in Lahore reported full mobilisation of machinery and pumps to clear underpasses.
Deaths, injuries
According to the PDMA report, most deaths in Punjab occurred due to the collapse of dilapidated houses and being in unsafe locations.
In Sheikhupura, the roof of a factory collapsed due to strong wind, killing a worker from Sadiqabad and seriously injuring five others, the state-run Pakistan Television reported.
Several mud and dilapidated houses were also damaged due to the storm. There were also incidents of falling trees and damage to solar panels in Lahore.
District Officer Rescue 1122 Sibghatullah told Dawn that a labourer died after a wall of an under-construction house in Sood Gangal on Kallar Syedan Road collapsed due to the strong winds. The deceased was identified as Imtiaz Yaqoob, 52.
Scores of people were also injured in Taxila, Lahore High Court Road, Adiala Road, Peshawar Road, Chakri Road, Kotha Kalan, Rawat, Gujar Khan and Chakri near the motorway, he said.
In another incident, a man died after the wall of his house in Fauji Colony, Pirwadhai, collapsed. Naseebullah, 60, was seriously injured in the incident and was shifted to the hospital but could not survive.
In Attock, a child was killed and six others, including a woman and her daughter, were injured.
According to Rescue 1122, the Grade 2 student, identified as Mohammad Hassan Shahbaz, was killed when the wall of his house collapsed in the Mithial village, within the limits of Jand Police Station.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed announced that medical assistance would be provided to the injured people, the PDMA said.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast more rain and thunderstorms across Punjab and KP on Sunday, including in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar and Mardan.
Damage in KP
Strong winds and hailstorms also caused extensive damage to crops and power lines in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but no deaths were reported.
The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) said that more than 113 feeders across the province tripped due to the windstorm. The power utility said that the 19 feeders tripped each in Peshawar and Mardan, 13 in Khyber, 30 in Swabi, 13 in Swat, 15 in Abbottabad and four in Mansehra.
The Peshawar cantonment experienced power outages spanning several hours after the windstorm. Sources told Dawn that the cantonment power supply was underground and Pesco staff had to seek permission from military authorities to start rehabilitation work.
Other severely affected areas included Mingora, Amankot, Rahimabad and Qambar, where residents faced immense difficulty commuting and accessing essential services. Citizens called upon the authorities to expedite drainage and relief efforts to prevent further damage.
In Mingora, Swat, flash floods from overflowing drains inundated homes and disrupted daily life, forcing students to sit exams in complete darkness due to outages.
According to the Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature in the Swat valley dropped to 20 degrees Celsius due to the rain and hailstorm.
Rain and hailstorms in the Ambar and Pandiali tehsils of Mohmand district damaged crops, causing losses to the farmers.
According to initial reports, several slum houses were damaged and trees were uprooted in remote localities; however, no loss of life was immediately reported, official sources confirmed.
Moreover, a heavy windstorm followed by light rain disrupted proceedings on Saturday, the second day of the ongoing Tablighi Ijtema in the Baffa area.
The congregation, which began on Friday, has attracted hundreds of thousands of participants from across Hazara, Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country. The organisers expect an even larger turnout on Sunday, the final day when special prayers will be offered.
Meanwhile, a windstorm followed by light rain also affected life in other parts of the Hazara division.
Flight faces turbulence
Meanwhile, a private airline flight FL-842 from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport. The pilot aborted landing and safely returned to Karachi following air traffic control instructions, Geo News reported.
Passengers, shaken by repeated jolts, refused to re-board after landing in Karachi. Airport sources said 57 passengers cancelled their travel plans, delaying the flight’s re-departure.
At least two other flights to Lahore were diverted to Karachi due to poor visibility, while departures were delayed until weather conditions stabilised.
As the storm subsided, operations at Lahore airport resumed, with flights PK-305 and PA-405 eventually departing for Karachi.

• Officials spar over India’s targeting of civilian areas
UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has warned the United Nations that India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) represents a dangerous escalation that violates international law and threatens the survival of more than 240 million people.
Speaking at a UN meeting on protecting water in armed conflict on Friday evening, Pakistan urged the world community to act before such actions triggered a humanitarian catastrophe or destabilised the region.
“This is a grave violation of international law, including human rights law, the treaty law and customary international law,” said Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Arria Formula meeting convened by Slovenia.
“We strongly condemn India’s unlawful announcement to hold the Treaty in abeyance and call upon India to strictly abide by its legal obligations and refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers that are a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan. We will never accept any such moves,” Ambassador Jadoon said.
 
 

He also drew attention to Indian leaders’ alarming statements, noting that “troubling pronouncements by the Indian leadership to ‘starve the people of Pakistan’ depict a highly dangerous and perverse thinking.
Pakistan used the UN forum to appeal for international consensus against the weaponisation of water.
Ambassador Jadoon urged the Security Council to monitor such developments closely and take pre-emptive action where necessary:
“The Council must play a role by identifying situations where violations of international law, including IHL (International Humanitarian Law) principles, could jeopardise peace and security or lead to catastrophic humanitarian crisis.”
 






Pakistan’s statement highlighted three key points, legal prohibitions, obligations of warring parties and weaponisation of water. International law, including human rights law and IHL, prohibits attacks on water resources and related infrastructure. Den­ying access to water violates established norms and UN Security Council resolutions. Similarly, all parties in a conflict are bound by the IHL and must avoid actions that result in severe humanitarian consequences. Besides, using water as a tool of coercion or warfare is unacceptable and destabilising.
“It is regrettable that one country, exhibiting malevolent designs, has chosen to weaponise water in addition to using it as a bargain chip,” the diplomat said.
Pakistan’s statement comes amid growing concern in Islamabad over India’s recent efforts to bypass treaty mechanisms and undermine the role of international mediators, particularly the World Bank, which had brokered the Treaty 1960. Officials in Pakistan view these actions as part of a broader pattern aimed at eroding cooperative frameworks and applying pressure on Islamabad through non-military means.
Ambassador Jadoon reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for global efforts to ensure the protection of water resources during conflicts and emphasised the need for a “resolute, principled and united stand” against any attempts to politicise or militarise water.
Terror charge rejected
At a separate meeting, delegates from Delhi and Islamabad engaged in a sharp verbal duel at the UN, after Pakistani Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad denounced the Indian military for targeting civilian areas during the recent clash.
The exchange took place at the Security Council during its debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict on Friday.
Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish reacted to his Pakistani counterpart’s tough statement, and while repeating Delhi’s usual allegations said that Pakistan had no justification to talk about civilians when it is using terrorism as a policy.
Pakistani delegate Saima Saleem hit back, accusing the Indian envoy of relying on “disinformation, deflection and denial” as she said India was itself involved in acts of terrorism.
“No amount of obfuscation can hide the facts. India brazenly kills and maims civilians in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, carries out blatant aggression against Pakistan by targeting civilians and sponsors terrorism and assassinations in my country and across the globe,” Ms Saleem, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, told the 15-member Council.
India, she said, had even stooped to a new low of impeding the flow of rivers that serve as a lifeline for the 240 million people of Pakistan.
She pointed out that Pakistan, together with the international community, had condemned the Pahalgam incident.
“If India had nothing to hide, it should have agreed to credible, impartial and independent investigations into the incident,” the delegate said. “On the contrary,” she added, “India continues to subject people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to state-sponsored terrorism to suppress their legitimate freedom struggle.”
Blatant aggression
Earlier this month, she recalled, India committed blatant aggression against Pakistan, launching unprovoked attacks on innocent civilians, killing 40 people including seven women and 15 children and injuring 121 others, including 10 women and 27 children.
“India certainly has no credibility to lecture others on the protection of civilians,” Ms Saleem told delegates.
Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts and sacrifices, she pointed out, were well-known and acknowledged globally and Islamabad remains steadfast in its commitment to combat this menace.
On the other hand, she said, India continues to actively fund and support terror proxies that include Fitna Al Khawarij —the term used by the government for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Balochistan Liberation Army and its Majeed Brigade group — to kill innocent civilians in Pakistan.
She drew the delegates’ attention to the recent savage attack on a school bus in Khuzdar that took the lives of innocent school-going children and left dozens injured.
“If India is genuinely committed to peace and security and good neighbourliness, it should end its state-sponsored terrorism, cease its oppression of Kashmiris, comply with its obligations under international law, UN Charter and bilateral treaties, and engage in meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Ms Saleem added.

Earlier this month, two other Pakistani mountaineers achieved feats of their own, with renowned Pakistani climber Sajid Ali Sadpara summiting the world’s seventh highest peak, Dhaulagiri (8,167 m), without oxygen or porter support on May 11 and renowned Pakistani climber Sirbaz Khan successfully summiting Mt Kangchenjunga (8,586m), the third highest peak in the world, without supplemental oxygen on May 18.
Munawar’s official Facebook account confirmed the feat, writing that he “raised the green flag at the summit of [the] highest peak in the world”.
“This is the first time that a Pakistani has summited Mt Everest from the north side,” the post added. “Saad has safely descended back to Camp 3 for the night. Requesting prayers for safe descent back to the base camp during the next days.”
According to climbers, the route to summit Everest’s northern face starts in Tibet, a different route from most mountaineers who ascend from the Nepalese side.
Additionally, according to mountaineering website Explorersweb, Chinese authorities only started issuing permits to summit the northern face last January.
Summiting Everest from the north bypasses the Khumbu Icefall, a dangerous section on the South Side, making it safer in that aspect.
Mingma G, owner of the Imagine Nepal expedition team of which Munawar was a part, told Dawn.com that Saad Munawar and eight other foreign climbers successfully climbed Everest from the north side on Saturday morning.
“Saad recently began climbing high-altitude mountains and has already conquered Aconcagua, Elbrus, Kilimanjaro, and Lobuche Peak in Nepal,” he added.
Karrar Haidri, Secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, also congratulated Munawar in a statement.
“We are immensely proud to share that Saad Bin Munawar has made history as the first and only Pakistani to summit Mount Everest (8,848.86 meters) via the challenging North Side route — a feat that places him among the world’s elite mountaineers,” the statement read.
The club’s statement added that Munawar is a “renowned adventurer, mountaineer, and author [and] has long been a source of inspiration in Pakistan’s adventure community”.
“Before this Everest ascent, he was the first Pakistani to summit Mt Aconcagua, the highest peak outside Asia,” the statement added. “His leadership in expeditions and mountaineering literature continues to motivate a new generation of climbers.”
In their statement, Imagine Nepal also congratulated the other climbers, including three women, for reaching the summit from the north side.
“Dr Simone Molter from Germany conquered her first 8000m peak, fulfilling her dream after years of preparation and determination,” Imagine Nepal wrote.
“Angela Yeung from South Africa stood on the world’s highest peak for a greater cause — “raising awareness and funds for survivors of gender-based violence through her Impilo Collection Foundation,” it added.
“Chhiri Aangjum Sherpa from Nepal, completed her 4th continental summit, inspiring women everywhere with her strength, unity, and vision,” the statement continued. “These women are more than climbers — they are leaders, activists, and role models proving that no peak is too high when driven by purpose.”
The other climbers included Justin Moore Walker from the United States, Dawa Gyalje Sherpa, Ang Mingma Sherpa, Sonam Tashi Sherpa, Ngima Dorjee Sherpa, Lakpa Tenzing Sherpa, Dawa Kami Sherpa and Thupten Topchen Sherpa.</p><small>2025-05-24 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241944340e3db0d.png?r=211548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072/multiple-casualties-reported-amid-heavy-rains-across-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Multiple casualties reported amid heavy rains across Punjab</strong></a><br><p>At least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains lashed several parts of Punjab on Saturday, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Earlier today, the PDMA urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across the province to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of Punjab, a statement by the PDMA said.
“Relevant departments to be on alert to deal with emergency situations,” the statement read, adding that the provincial control room and all district emergency operation centres have also been alerted.
The situation was being monitored 24/7 in the PDMA control room, DG Kathia said.
He added, “Citizens should be careful and stay away from electric poles and hanging wires.
“Stay in safe places to avoid lightning. Never stay in open places during bad weather and lightning. Avoid unnecessary travel and drive slowly.”

PDMA spokesperson Mazhar Hussain said, “The public can call PDMA helpline 1129 for assistance.”
Motorway Police spokesperson Syed Imran Ahmed said that M2 Motorway from Thokar to Kot Momin, M3 Motorway from Faizpur to Darkhana and Lahore-Sialkot Motorway were all closed due to the severe weather.
“Motorways are closed to ensure public safety and safe travel,” he added.
The spokesperson also said that dark clouds were visible on M4 Motorway from Abdul Hakeem to Sher Shah and M5 Motorway from Multan to Rahim Yar Khan.
“There is a severe thunderstorm at various places on the national highway from Lahore to Chichawatni as well as from Mian Channu, Khanewal, Multan and Lodhran,” he added.
He urged the public to be careful while driving and avoid speeding.

WASA DG Ghufran Ahmed also said, “All staff and machinery were instructed to remain on full alert. Pumps and staff will remain ready at all underpasses.”
Separately, the roof of a local factory in Sheikhupura collapsed due to a strong wind, killing a worker from Sadiqabad and seriously injuring five others, state media Pakistan Television reported.
The report stated that Rescue 1122 teams pulled out the dead body and the injured from the rubble and shifted them to the Sheikhupura District Headquarters Hospital.
 






The PDMA released a report on the damage caused by the storm across the province.
The data released by the PDMA showed that three people died in Lahore, two in Jhelum, one each in Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Sialkot, Mianwali, Layyah and Jhang.
PDMA’s Hussain said, “The deaths occurred due to the collapse of dilapidated houses and being in unsafe locations.”
Several mud and dilapidated houses were also damaged due to the storm, he said, adding, “There were incidents of falling trees and damage to solar panels in Lahore.”
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed announced that medical assistance will be provided to the injured people, the PDMA statement read.
DG Kathia said that financial assistance will be provided to the affected families.
A statement by the Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) said that the power supply was restored to all 132kV grid stations by removing faults on transmission lines.
The team was restoring 11kV feeders and the system will be normalised soon, the statement added.
The company earlier stated that the power supply in South Punjab was affected by the rain. Feeders tripped in Multan, Khanewal, Vehari and Sahiwal, it added.
Mepco Chief Executive Officer Gul Muhammad Zahid directed operational officers to remain alert, the statement read, adding, “Power restoration activities will start after the storm stops.”
On Friday, the PDMA issued an alert about wind and dust storms in different areas of Punjab.
It said that the wind and dust storms would continue today with a possibility of rain in Rawalpindi, Murree, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Faisalabad, Okara, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Khushab, Sargodha and Mianwali.
There would be rain in the south Punjab areas, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar, it added.</p><small>2025-05-24 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2421464373a86a6.jpg?r=214927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913088/trump-rips-into-diversity-and-inclusion-policies-in-rally-style-speech' target='_blank'><strong>Trump rips into diversity and inclusion policies in rally-style speech</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump ripped into diversity and inclusion policies in the United States, knocked Nato and took credit for building up the military on Saturday in a campaign-style commencement speech at the prestigious West Point Military Academy in New York.
Trump, wearing a suit and his signature red “Make America Great Again” cap, mixed advice to “work hard” with a list of his top grievances about cultural and political issues while speaking to a stadium filled with cadets, family members and a largely supportive crowd.
“The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to transform foreign cultures,” Trump said. “The military’s job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime, in any place.”
Since coming into office for the second time in January, Trump has rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the military and throughout the government as part of a larger effort to rescind policies enacted by his predecessor, Joe Biden.
“We’ve liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” Trump told the 1,002 cadets graduating from the academy. “There will be no more critical race theory or transgender for everybody forced onto our brave men and women in uniform, or on anybody else for that matter in this country.”
 


Trump has been a strong supporter of the military even as he has put his own stamp on it, as he has on other branches of government. In February, he fired the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of military leadership.
It was the second time Trump addressed graduates of the academy on the Hudson River following his appearance in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when cadets sat further apart and wore masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
West Point aims to educate the next generation of army leaders for a military that is meant to be apolitical and is sworn to defend the US Constitution.
In a speech full of partisan rhetoric on Saturday, Trump took credit for rebuilding the Army and referenced his tariff-fueled trade war while repeating his longstanding criticism of Nato allies for not spending more on defence.
“We’ve been ripped off by every nation in the world on trade. We’ve been ripped off at the Nato level,” Trump said. “We’ve been ripped off like no country has ever been ripped off, but they don’t rip us off anymore.”
The president will preside over the army’s celebration of its 250th anniversary on June 14 with a parade on one of Washington’s main thoroughfares. The anniversary coincides with Trump’s own birthday.
This week, Trump spoke about a signature piece of his military vision, announcing he had selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield and named a Space Force general to head the programme aimed at blocking threats from China and Russia. Trump said on Saturday that the shield would protect West Point.
Experts have said the Golden Dome could provoke other states to launch similar systems or develop more advanced weapons to evade the missile shield, escalating an arms race in space.</p><small>2025-05-24 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24141259b47c243.png?r=142019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913040/pakistani-users-able-to-access-x-after-brief-disruption-amid-global-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani users able to access X after brief disruption amid global outage</strong></a><br><p>Services on social media platform X were restored on Saturday evening as users in Pakistan were able to access the site.
According to real-time monitor Downdetector, fewer problem reports were submitted on Saturday evening, with a low of 40 complaints reported by 8:36pm.

Earlier, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
According to a statement, the telecom body said that this disruption follows a similar one reported on Thursday, which was resolved by the platform itself.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways,” the statement read. “All other internet services across the country remain fully functional.”
The PTA added that global internet observatory NetBlocks also confirmed that the outages are international and “not related to any country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
Users in Pakistan previously reported mass disruption on the social media platform, with real-time monitor Downdetector showing a peak of 372 outages at 5:36pm.
Over 600 complaints in total were reported on Saturday.

Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
“Our team is working 24/7 to resolve this. Thanks for your patience — updates soon,” it said at 5am PKT.
 






In the early hours of Friday, the platform had said: “X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today. We are experiencing a data centre outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue.”
 






With X stating a “data centre outage” as a reason for the service disruption, users speculated that a fire at the platform’s data centre in the US state of Oregon’s Hillsboro city was the cause of the issues.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources. The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.
Downdetector, which tracks outages, did not show problems reported by users at 1pm. However, outages had spiked to 76 at around 8:30pm last night.

While updates by X did not mention issues with messaging services, many users reported not being able to access their direct messages (DMs), with an error reading: “Cannot retrieve messages at this time. Please try again later.”
Some users also reported being logged out of their accounts, with an error stating “something went wrong”.
 






X had remained blocked in Pakistan since Feb 17, 2024 — when allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections gained momentum — but was restored on May 7 amid the recent conflict with India.
Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, bought the platform (formerly Twitter) for $44 billion in late 2022. He rebranded it to X in July 2023, with the domain fully migrating to X.com in May 2024.
In March this year, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired X in a deal that valued the social media network at $33 billion.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump and heads the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><small>2025-05-24 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606039-massive-storm-kills-eight-injures-45-across-punjab-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Storm wreaks havoc in Punjab, killing eight, injuring 45</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
According to a press release, the campaign aims to immunise more than 10.6m children under the age of five across all 30 districts of Sindh.
“The campaign is taking place from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and involves the efforts of over 80,000 trained polio workers going door-to-door with support from 25,539 law enforcement personnel to ensure that no child is missed,” the statement said. “Children between the ages of 6 and 59 months will also receive Vitamin A supplements to help boost their immunity.”

According to the press release, this new campaign follows two previous drives in February and April. Earlier this week, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah raised the issue of rising polio cases and expressed the need for accountability and collective action.
“With continued virus circulation in some environmental samples and four polio cases reported in Sindh so far this year, this latest round of vaccinations reinforces the province’s resolve to interrupt transmission and protect children from the lifelong consequences of this preventable disease,” the press release read.
“Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere,” it added, quoting a spokesperson from the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Sindh. “This campaign reflects our commitment to reach every child, even in the hardest-to-reach communities, and to ensure that Pakistan moves closer to eradication.”
According to the EOC, polio teams will be active in 1,292 union councils, supported by district administrations and healthcare partners, delivering polio drops and engaging families at the doorstep.
“EOC Sindh appeals to parents, teachers, religious leaders, community elders, and the media to join hands in this vital national effort,” the press release added. “To report missed children or ask questions about the vaccine, citizens can call the 1166 helpline or WhatsApp 0346-777-6546.”
Pakistan, one of the only two polio-endemic countries in the world, reported 74 cases in 2024.
Earlier today, the KP government set a target of vaccinating approximately 7.3 million children under the age of five during a five-day anti-polio campaign, which also begins on Monday.
Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah inaugurated the campaign during a ceremony at Services Hospital, according to a press release.
Additional Secretary Health and Emergency Operations Centre coordinator Shafiullah Khan, representatives from Unicef and the World Health Organisation, and other officials were in attendance.</p><small>2025-05-24 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606030-private-airline-flight-to-lahore-escapes-disaster-caught-in-heavy-turbulence' target='_blank'><strong>Private airline flight to Lahore escapes disaster, caught in heavy turbulence</strong></a><br><p>

The suspect, a 39-year-old woman, is accused of going on a stabbing spree on Friday at the main station in Hamburg, stunning the northern city in the middle of the evening rush hour.
The woman has “very clear indications of a psychological illness”, police said in a statement, without giving further details on her condition. They added that there were no signs she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack, which left four victims seriously wounded.
The woman was subdued by two passersby and law enforcement officers before being taken into custody at the scene without resisting arrest, police said. She was due to appear before a judge later on Saturday.
Police say they have ruled out a “political motive” for the attack and believe the suspect acted alone.
The victims range in age from 19 to 85.
The four in serious condition were a 24-year-old man and three women, aged 24, 52 and 85, police said. Emergency officials initially said their wounds were life-threatening, but police say all the victims now appear to be out of immediate danger.
Rush hour
The attack took place just after 6:00 pm (1600 GMT) on Friday on one of the platforms in front of a standing train, German media reported.
The suspect was thought to have turned “against passengers” at the station, a spokeswoman for the Hanover federal police directorate, which also covers Hamburg, told AFP.
Some of the victims were treated on board waiting trains in the station, German daily Bild reported.
Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances. Forensic police could also be seen walking up and down the platforms where the attack took place.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his shock in a call with the mayor of Hamburg.
“My thoughts are with the victims and their families,” Merz said, according to a readout from a spokesman.
Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks with often extremist motivations that have put security at the top of the agenda.
The most recent, on Sunday, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld.
The investigation into that attack has been handed over to federal prosecutors after the Syrian suspect told the police officers who arrested him that he had extremist beliefs.
The question of security, and the immigrant origin of some of the attackers, was a major topic during Germany’s recent election campaign.
Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU topped the February vote, which also saw a record score of more than 20 per cent for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Last year, Germany toughened its legislation on carrying knives, now banned at public gatherings and on long-distance trains. They are also banned in specific zones in some cities, including Hamburg’s train station.
Experts and police unions have previously questioned whether such bans are effective.</p><small>2025-05-24 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2417382632715f9.jpg?r=191445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061/field-marshal-munir-lauds-political-leaderships-strategic-foresight-during-marka-i-haq' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir lauds political leadership’s strategic foresight during Marka-i-Haq</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has lauded the strategic foresight of the country’s political leadership during Marka-i-Haq that ensured the country’s success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos against India, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated the army chief with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at the Presidency earlier this week.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), while hosting a dinner, the army chief expressed profound gratitude to the political leadership for their strategic foresight during Marka-i-Haq and lauded the seamless inter-services coordination that ensured operational success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.
Field Marshal Munir also acknowledged the unwavering role of the youth and media in countering the disinformation campaign waged by India, describing them as a “steel wall” against malign propaganda.
“The COAS also commended the outstanding contributions of Pakistani scientists, engineers, and diplomats, whose professionalism and resolve proved critical during the conflict,” the press release said.
“The dinner was hosted to honour the political leadership, steadfast commitment of the armed forces, and the indomitable spirit of the people demonstrated during Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,” it added.
According to the ISPR, the participants of the event included President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers, governors, chief ministers, chairman joint chiefs of staff committee, air and naval staff chiefs,  senior leadership of major political parties, high-ranking government officials and senior officers from the three services.
“Participants paid tribute to the sagacious leadership that steered the nation through a defining moment, hailed the courage and sacrifice of the armed forces, and commended the resolute patriotism of the Pakistani people,” it added.
“The evening stood as a powerful affirmation of national unity and the collective resolve to advance with renewed strength and cohesion,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-05-24 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606004-pakistanis-deported-abroad-to-face-passport-cancellation-police-action-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis deported from abroad to face passport cancellation, police action: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>

Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP), made up of many students who spearheaded the uprising that ended Hasina’s 15-year iron-fisted rule last year, said he worried about an “anti-democratic” future.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the caretaker government until elections are held, has called for rival political parties jostling for power to give him their full support.
Bangladesh has a long history of coups, and the army retains a powerful role.
Islam, an ally of Yunus who previously served in his cabinet, told reporters on Saturday that he foresaw a situation similar to January 11, 2007, when a state of emergency was declared, resulting in a two-year-long military-backed government.
“There are indications that a 1/11-style military-backed government could re-emerge — one that is anti-democratic and anti-people,” Islam said.
‘Should not interfere’
Bangladesh’s political crisis escalated this week as rival parties protested with competing demands.
Army chief General Wakeruz Zaman said this week that elections should be held by December, Dhaka’s newspapers reported, aligning with the demands of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
But Islam said that the military’s role was “to ensure national security” and not to get involved in politics.
“While the military is an essential institution for state security, it should not interfere in political affairs,” he said.
Yunus has said elections could come as early as December, but holding them later, at the latest by June 2026, would allow more time for the democratic reforms he says are needed.
Islam said it was for those reforms that students launched their protests last year, but that Yunus told him during a meeting on Thursday that the pressure put on him had frustrated him.
“He assumed office to bring about fundamental change. People expect to see trials, reforms, and a peaceful transition of power. Under the current circumstances, he feels he cannot deliver to those expectations,” Islam said.
“There is a real fear that elections may not be free and fair but instead heavily restricted.”</p><small>2025-05-24 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241811109bb393f.jpg?r=181123' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913054/sindh-cm-meets-wb-delegation-to-discuss-wash-project-flood-relief-housing' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM meets WB delegation to discuss WASH project, flood relief housing</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday held a meeting with a World Bank delegation to discuss the launch of the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) project and the ongoing flood relief housing efforts as well as other initiatives in the province.
The meeting, which took place at the CM House in Karachi, included WB managing director Anna Bejarred, country director Naji Bin Hussein and other officials from the Bank, a statement by the CM House read.
 






Both the Sindh government and WB sides agreed on the effective initiation of the WASH project aimed at improving access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene practices across the province, according to the statement.
“The initiative targeted 3,200 flood-affected villages, providing essential facilities to enhance public health and living conditions,” it added.
CM Murad highlighted that the WASH project was being launched with a total budget of $270 million, benefiting approximately 1.5m people, with breakdown includes $75m from the World Bank, $13m from the Islamic Development Bank, $100m from the Asian Development Bank, and $100m from the Sindh government.
The meeting also discussed the Sindh People’s Housing Project. CM Murad noted that the 2022 floods submerged 70 per cent of Sindh, affecting 12.36 million people and destroying 2.1 million homes.
“The housing project covered a rural population of 15 million, exceeding the population of 154 countries worldwide,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.
 
 

“So far, 120,000 bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries were opened, and financial assistance was distributed to 1.15 million individuals,” he added.
“Around 750,000 house foundations have been completed, with 500,000 homes in the final stages of construction. Additionally, 900,000 land ownership certificates have been issued in the names of women, empowering them economically and socially.”
The chief minister also said that the project has generated over one million employment opportunities, providing vital livelihoods for affected communities.
During the visit, the WB delegation also toured a photo gallery at the CM House featuring prominent Pakistani women, from Fatima Jinnah to other national icons. The delegation appreciated the historical architecture and artistic presentation of the residence.
A day earlier, CM Murad and Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari visited a flood rehabilitation housing project in Shaheed Benazirabad district of Sindh, accompanying a delegation of WB officials. During the visit, WB’s Bejerde reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to supporting the Sindh government’s flood recovery efforts.</p><small>2025-05-24 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606010-four-missing-tourists-from-gujrat-found-dead-in-skardu-ravine' target='_blank'><strong>Four missing tourists from Gujrat found dead in Skardu ravine</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this month, the minister had announced that the federal budget would be presented on June 2, however, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said yesterday that the budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.
Meeting a delegation at the Institution of Engineers Pakistan (IEP) in Lahore, led by IEP Secretary General Engr Ameer Zameer, the planning minister told reporters that the budget had not been delayed due to any pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but because of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s upcoming visit to friendly nations and the Eidul Azha holidays.
“We had very good negotiations with the IMF,” Iqbal said. “As you’ve seen, they acknowledged our government’s efforts. The main reason behind the delay is the PM’s five-day visit to friendly countries … and Eid after that.
“We decided to present the budget after Eid so that we can easily convene a meeting of parliament afterwards,” he added.
Iqbal said that the government wants to minimise the burden on the general public, but noted that defence spending would increase to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty.
“It is our national duty to provide the armed forces with whatever they need in this budget to bolster their capacity and defend our country in the future,” the minister said. “It has been proven that we have a dangerous neighbour (India) who attacked us in the night, but we gave them a befitting response.”
He added that the country must “remain ready to respond if they attack again”.
Speaking about Pakistani water security, Iqbal said that the country will fast-track water projects, including the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams.
“We are prioritising them so that Pakistani water is secure,” he said.
“The PM has sent over a thousand agricultural engineers to China for training, who will complete their training this year and bring about an agricultural Green Revolution 2.0,” he explained. “We aim to develop our own seeds and modernise our dairy and livestock sectors.”
Iqbal added that within the budget, funding has been allocated for an internship for engineers. “Thousands of young engineers across the country will be able to receive on-the-job training so that they receive better job opportunities in the market.”
However, he stated that Pakistan would only have a development budget of Rs1 trillion to do all of this.
“Our ministers required Rs3tr to complete our ongoing projects. But, because of this shortfall, we are putting a cap on low-priority projects and will try to complete our high-priority projects as quickly as possible.
Political unity
When asked about political relations with the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Iqbal expressed that there needs to be unity among all political actors.
Criticising the PTI, he said, “When we passed the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we tried to take all parties on board and reach a consensus. But when the PTI took this to their founder, he vetoed it.
“Similarly, when the nation is standing behind Field Marshal Asim Munir’s leadership, look at the statements the PTI founder is giving about him,” Iqbal added. “At a time when we need national solidarity, he is only thinking about retaliation.”</p><small>2025-05-24 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241649419278b98.jpg?r=164947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913053/indias-monsoon-rains-arrive-8-days-early-earliest-in-16-years' target='_blank'><strong>India’s monsoon rains arrive 8 days early, earliest in 16 years</strong></a><br><p>Monsoon rains hit the coast of India’s southernmost state of Kerala on Saturday, eight days earlier than usual, marking the earliest arrival in 16 years and providing the promise of a bumper harvest and relief from a gruelling heatwave.
The monsoon, the lifeblood of the country’s $4 trillion economy, delivers nearly 70 per cent of the rain that India needs to water farms and replenish aquifers and reservoirs. Nearly half of India’s farmland, without any irrigation cover, depends on the annual June-September rains to grow a number of crops.
Summer rains usually begin to lash Kerala around June 1 before spreading nationwide by mid-July, allowing farmers to plant crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane.
The onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on May 24 is its earliest onset since May 23, 2009, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.
The monsoon has covered Kerala and parts of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, as well as parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram, the IMD said.
Conditions are favourable for the monsoon’s further spread into Goa, parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, the northeastern states, West Bengal, and the remaining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the next two to three days.
Surplus pre-monsoon rainfall and an early monsoon onset will help farmers, especially in the southern and central states, to sow summer crops earlier than usual, said Ashwini Bansod, vice president for commodities research at Phillip Capital India, a Mumbai-based brokerage.
“Abundant soil moisture and early sowing could potentially boost crop yields,” Bansod said.
Last year, the monsoon reached the coast of Kerala on May 30, and overall summer rains were the highest since 2020, supporting recovery from a drought in 2023.
The IMD last month forecast above-average monsoon rains for the second straight year in 2025.
The department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96pc and 104pc of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241404082dd1201.png?r=151213' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913042/four-missing-tourists-from-gujrat-found-dead-along-river-bank-in-skardu' target='_blank'><strong>Four missing tourists from Gujrat found dead along river bank in Skardu</strong></a><br><p>Four tourists from Gujrat who went missing in Gilgit-Baltistan on May 16 were finally located on Saturday morning at the bank of Indus River near Istak village in Skardu’s Roundu valley.
Family sources said Wasif Shahzad, 36, and Umar Ehsan, 20, both cousins from Kot Gakka near Mangowal; Salman Nasrullah Sandhu, 23, of Jassoki village; and Usman Dar, 23, of Saroki had arrived in Gilgit on May 13.
Gilgit range Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Raja Mirza Hassan said that according to police records, the four friends had started their travel from Hunza to Skardu on May 15. On the way they had stayed in a hotel near Karakoram at Danyor in Gilgit.
The four friends had resumed their journey to Skardu on May 16 and since then their mobile phones could not be reached.
Skardu Deputy Commissioner Arif Ahmad today confirmed that the location of the missing tourists’ vehicle has been traced near Satak Nala.
The vehicle had fallen into a deep gorge on the bank of the river below the Baltistan Highway after an accident.
Rescue 1122 and other rescue teams had been immediately dispatched to the scene to retrieve the bodies of the victims.
The relatives of the deceased youth were also taken to the accident site.
DIG Hassan said the last location of the missing friends was Jaglot town in Gilgit.
The DIG, citing the travellers’ reported plan, said they were supposed to arrive at Skardu’s Istak area. He said their whereabouts could not be traced by search teams till Saturday.
The GB police and Rescue 1122 had been jointly searching the missing friends at Jaglot-Skardu from Jaglot to Istak, according to the DIG.
An official of Rescue 1122 told Dawn.com that the car which was travelling to Skardu fell down in a deep ditch around 500 feet below the road.
Local police were busy searching for the missing tourists when this morning a white vehicle was seen down in a deep gorge on the bank of the river below Ganji Padi below the Baltistan Highway.
Istak Station House Officer (SHO) Ali Faro called the rescue team to the scene. A joint team of police and rescue was trying to reach the vehicle, but they were facing a lot of difficulty it.
A crane was being arranged to bring the car up.

“The accident occurred due to high speed, due to which the vehicle went straight into a deep gorge,” the SHO said.
“One body is seen out of the vehicle while three are inside it. Rescue personnel are using ropes to reach the bodies.”
According to a statement issued by Rescue 1122, its Gilgit team launched the search operation soon after they went missing on May 16.
Father of one of the missing person said they lost communication with them on May 16. He had appealed to the GB government, chief secretary and police chief to help trace the missing friends.
The search operation was carried out at various locations from Alam bridge to Shangus area, while Rescue 1122 team searched in Skardu. During the operation, the rescue personnel obtained information about the movement of tourists from police check posts while information was collected from local hotel owners and people of the area.
“The road passes through terrain along with Indus River, where flow of water is dangerously high these days,” DIG Hassan said.
The search was extended in remote and difficult areas with the help of binoculars to scout possible accident sites.
Many incidents happen at Baltistan road due to the difficult terrain, particularly from Gilgit’s Jaglot to Skardu’s Istak area, where vehicles fall into Indus River.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2415562965866ad.jpg?r=155642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913049/nab-recovers-and-disburses-rs88bn-during-first-quarter-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>NAB recovers and disburses Rs88bn during first quarter of 2025</strong></a><br><p>The National Accountability Bureau recovered and disbursed over Rs88 billion during the first quarter of 2025, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
This was announced during the 24th “DGs Conference” of the bureau, a three-day event that concluded at NAB headquarters in Islamabad.
According to a press release, these recoveries included direct recoveries worth over Rs2bn and indirect recoveries amounting to Rs86bn.
The recoveries were made from public and private lands associated with cases of illegal transfer and occupation, Radio Pakistan said, adding that the disbursed amounts were returned to the relevant affected entities.
Regarding indirect recoveries, NAB Balochistan retrieved state land measuring 340 acres of Chiltan Park and 250 acres of forest department which translate into Ra6.45bn.
NAB Lahore recovered Rs70.87bn in three mega cases including Employees Cooperative Housing Society, State Life Insurance Employees Cooperative Housing Society and Sarwar Omega Villas.
NAB Multan recovered Rs13 million in GFS 7 Wonders Housing Scheme while NAB Sukkur recovered 610 acres of NHA land worth of 8.53bn.
Regarding disbursement of direct recoveries, NAB transferred Rs9.72m directly to the federal government, Rs10.80m to provincial governments and Rs73. 51m to different departments or financial institutions.
A significant portion amounting to Rs1.99bn has also been directly distributed to over 19,000 victims of various scams.
These recoveries were made from individuals and entities through plea bargains, voluntary returns and settlements.
“NAB remains resolute in its mission to recover looted public funds and advance its vision of a corruption-free Pakistan,” Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605992-pakistan-to-fast-track-hydro-projects-following-indias-suspension-of-water-treaty' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to 'fast-track hydro projects' following India's suspension of water treaty</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
Speaking on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ on Friday night, when asked if PTI should also be included in the delegation, Khan said: “All stakeholders are welcome to get this country out of this crisis.”
“We need to be on one page and fight the country’s case. Prime Minister [Shehbaz] sahib has made the right choice by choosing Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] sahib to continue fighting Pakistan’s case in international forums,” Khan added.
 


The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India — without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.
The premier entrusted the delegation’s leadership to PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who said he would “present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
The delegation also includes Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik; former foreign ministers Khurram Dastgir and Hina Rabbani Khar; Senators Sherry Rehman and Faisal Subzwari; as well as senior diplomats Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
 
 

“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” Radio Pakistan had said.
A PPP delegation comprising Bilawal, Rehman and Khar met with PM Shehbaz yesterday to seek guidance to highlight Pakistan’s stance before important global powers.
In a similar development, the Indian government has also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-24 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605983-woman-abducted-in-broad-daylight-from-lahores-dha' target='_blank'><strong>Woman abducted in broad daylight from Lahore's DHA</strong></a><br><p>

Saudi Arabia deported a total of 5,033 Pakistani beggars whereas another 369 individuals have been apprehended for begging in five other countries in the last 16 months.
Last month, the interior minister had said that the government would block the passports of Pakistanis deported, and tighten the process of issuing new travel documents.
Around 106 Pakistanis were also deported from European countries arrived in Islamabad last month.
According to state-run PTV News, an important meeting, led by the interior minister, was held in Islamabad where it was decided that deportees who were coming back will have their passports cancelled and an FIR will also be registered against them.
The names of the deportees will also be put on the passport control list for five years, PTV News added.
A committee was also formed under the chairmanship of the interior secretary to further tighten and improve passport laws.
Naqvi was quoted as saying that the deportees were causing embarrassment to Pakistan at an international level, adding that no concessions would be made to them in the future.</p><small>2025-05-24 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605979-rain-spell-brings-relief-to-islamabad-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Rain spell brings relief to Islamabad, Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the Fund had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
In a statement issued today, the IMF’s Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter termed the recent discussions “constructive” and said: “We will continue discussions towards agreeing over the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days.”
“Discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure,” Porter added.
 
 

“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),” Porter said, referring to the $7 billion loan programme and the climate fund deal, respectively.
“The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,” the IMF official added.
The Fund noted that the staff visit “focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation, and the budget strategy” for FY2025-26.
Shedding light on other matters reviewed, Porter said: “Discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector as well as other structural reforms which will help foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.”
The government emphasised its commitment to “ensuring sound macroeconomic policy making and building buffers”, according to the statement.
“In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is anchored within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent,” Porter stressed.
“At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange (FX) reserve buffers, preserving a fully functioning FX market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are critical to strengthening resilience to external shocks.”
The IMF mission appreciated the federal and provincial authorities for their “hospitality, constructive discussions, and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies”.
Affirming that it will continue its close dialogue with the authorities, the IMF said its next mission associated with the next EFF and RSF reviews was expected in the second half of 2025.
Imran seeks meeting with finance minister
As the federal government gears up for the budget, incarcerated ex-prime minister Imran Khan, whose PTI rules Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has called on Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to meet him before the budget announcment.
A post on Imran’s X account quoted Imran’s purported conversation with lawyers at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he is imprisoned. The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of the social media handler.
The post read: “As party chairman, it is necessary for the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to seek my guidance on budgetary and policy matters.
“The people have elected PTI to govern, and therefore, the responsibility for policymaking also rests with us. Consequently, it is essential that [KP Chief Minister] Ali Amin Gandapur and the finance minister meet with me before the budget is presented,” it added.
 






In his post, Imran again stressed the importance of national unity. “The economy is in shambles; investors and the youth are steadily leaving the country,” he claimed, stating it as one of his reasons to call for a dialogue.
The KP government has called upon its federal counterpart to immediately convene a meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and ensure the transfer of the constitutional share of funds allocated for the merged districts to the provincial government before the budget announcement.
Considerations for budget
During the staff visit, the IMF mission had multiple rounds of discussion yesterday, including a wrap-up session with Aurangzeb, informed sources said.
An IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday and with President Asif Ali Zardari the next day.
 
 

The defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the meeting with Aurangzeb, although discussions between the Federal Board of Revenue’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.
Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr.
Sources said there is no plan to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in the second year to meet a requirement of the RSF.
 
 

The sources said the relief measures for the salaried class, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.
The budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605962-more-than-63000-pakistani-quotas-haj-allocations-lapse' target='_blank'><strong>More than 63,000 Hajj quota allocations for Pakistan lapse</strong></a><br><p>

The sharp escalation in US President Donald Trump’s longstanding feud with the prestigious university came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues.
The Trump administration’s decision on Thursday — which was temporarily halted by a US judge after Harvard sued — has thrown the future of thousands of foreign students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
On Friday, Hong Kong Education Secretary Christine Choi called on universities in the Chinese city to welcome “outstanding students from all over the world”.
“For international students affected by the United States’ student admission policy, the Education Bureau (EDB) has appealed to all universities in Hong Kong to provide facilitation measures for eligible students,” Choi said in a statement, noting the ban on Harvard’s admission of international students.
She said local universities were making use of government measures, including relaxing the maximum limits on foreign students to attract more to Hong Kong.
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Friday invited international students enrolled at Harvard, as well as anyone with offers to attend the elite school, to continue their studies at HKUST.
“HKUST is extending this opportunity to ensure talented students can pursue their educational goals without disruption,” it said in a statement.
The university “will provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures, and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition for interested students”, it added.
Harvard is ranked number one in US News and World Report’s most recent list of the world’s top universities, while HKUST is 105 out of more than 2,000 ranked.
President Trump is furious at Harvard for rejecting his administration’s push for oversight on admissions and hiring amid his claims the school is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
A US judge on Friday halted the administration’s move to prevent Harvard from admitting foreign students after the university sued, calling the government’s action unlawful.
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that the administration’s decision would hold Harvard “accountable for fostering violence, anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus”.
Beijing condemned the “politicisation of educational cooperation”, adding that the move by Washington would “only harm the image and international standing of the United States”.
Around 1,300 Chinese students are enrolled at Harvard, around a fifth of its international student body, according to university data.
Hundreds of thousands more attend other US colleges and universities, long viewed by many in China as beacons of academic freedom and rigour.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23143057fdaa0b3.jpg?r=120348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912827/in-new-attack-trump-spending-bill-will-hike-taxes-on-elite-colleges' target='_blank'><strong>In new attack, Trump spending bill will hike taxes on elite colleges</strong></a><br><p>The spending bill passed by the US House increases a tax the richest private universities pay on their endowment investment gains, a move proponents say reins in “woke” schools but that critics say will wind up hurting the poorest students the most.
Tucked within US President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill the House narrowly passed on Thursday is a proposal to increase a tax that some universities pay on the investment returns of their endowments from 1.4 per cent to as high as 21pc for some of the most elite colleges in the country.
The measure, part of the bill headed to the Republican-controlled Senate, is considered another front in Trump’s attack on elite colleges that he says are overrun by left-wing extremist thought and are cradles of anti-American and antisemitic movements. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University’s ability to enroll foreign students, a move the university said was illegal.
Representative Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said shortly after his committee passed the bill that “for too long, universities have received beneficial treatment from our tax code while disregarding the interest of taxpayers.” A fact sheet Smith put out states that the tax “holds woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations and other tax-exempt entities accountable.”
Premier universities say the bulk of most endowments is attached to specific projects as mandated by donors. So if they are spending more money on taxes, they will not be able to make up for it from their endowments. Instead, they will spend less elsewhere.
 
 

Luisa Rapport, a spokesperson for Stanford University, said the proposed tax hike “will directly reduce financial aid for undergraduates, support for faculty and graduate students, and funding for research programs.”
Kimberly Allen, a spokesperson for MIT, said the proposal is “basically a tax on national research and student aid, and at MIT alone it would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from our budget each year.”
Excellence, access at risk
During Trump’s first term in office, the current 1.4pc tax was levied on schools whose per student endowment was $500,000 or more — that is, the size of the endowment divided by the number of full-time students.
In 2023, 56 private schools paid that tax, and total receipts were about $380 million, according to the IRS.
Under the new proposal, schools with a per student endowment of $2 million or more would pay 21pc. International students would not count in that denominator under the bill, meaning schools with large populations of foreign students, like many of the elite universities Trump has targeted, would be punished.
Schools with a per student endowment of $1.25m to $2m would be taxed 14pc; schools with a per student endowment between $750,000 and $1.25m would be taxed 7pc; and those with endowments of $500,000 to $750,000 per student would be taxed 1.4pc.
The American Council on Education, a higher education lobbying and advocacy organization with 1,600 members, has fought the endowment tax since it was first created. Steven Bloom, who specializes in tax issues and endowments at the council, said the new proposal “takes very bad tax policy passed in 2017 and makes it more expensive and more complicated”.
Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College, estimates the new tax would cost elite universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Princeton, between $400m and $850m a year each.
Levine said that despite having some of the highest tuition prices, elite Ivy League schools with large endowments are able to offer massive financial aid packages for kids from poorer backgrounds.
“These are institutions that can offer excellence and access for lower-income students,” Levine said. “Both of those are at risk in the presence of a large endowment tax.”
Laura Wirick, a managing principal at Meketa Investments, a consultancy firm that advises endowments on how to allocate money, said if the highest proposed tax rate of 21pc goes through, it may push money away from elite schools as donors “might not donate funds because they might be best put to work with a tax-exempt institution”.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605957-us-based-pakistani-doctors-back-in-country-for-fresh-backdoor-talks-on-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>US-based Pakistani doctors back in country for fresh backdoor talks on Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>
