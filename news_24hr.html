Judge Amjad Hussain Shah gave the instructions in a case pertaining to November 26 protests last year, in which incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, has been facing legal proceedings.
SKTM, a charitable organisation established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 of Pakistan, and Namal University were both set up by Imran.
The bank accounts of the two institutions were said to have been inadvertently frozen following the issuance of an arrest warrant against Aleema in the case.
Arrest warrants for Aleema had been issued multiple times in the case over her repeated failure to attend the hearings. The court had also ordered the blocking of her national identity card (CNIC) and passport and the freezing of all of her bank accounts during a hearing on October 24.
Today, Shah heard arguments on Aleema’s application for unfreezing her bank accounts. Representatives of the SKTM also attended the hearing and presented arguments in favour of the restoration of the bank accounts.
For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah clarified that the prosecution had never requested, neither verbally nor in writing, the freezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts.
He also pointed out that there was no court order specifically directing relevant authorities to freeze the bank accounts of the two institutions.
The prosecutor contended that the confusion over the matter originated from an order sent to the State Bank of Pakistan in which Aleema’s identity card number was referenced.
“The state bank conducted a data search based on her CNIC, and during this process, these accounts also came up,” he said. “In light of a [subsequent] report, these accounts were frozen.”
He further clarified that the prosecution had no objection to the unfreezing of SKTM’s or Namal University’s bank accounts, but also stressed that Aleema’s personal and business accounts, which were frozen under the same order, should remain blocked.
Following the completion of the arguments, the judge ordered the unfreezing of the bank accounts of the two institutions and upheld the court’s earlier decision regarding Aleema’s personal bank accounts.
Criticism over accounts closure
Earlier, a wave of criticism had erupted over the closure of the bank accounts of SKMT, as many feared that it could affect the supply of medicines and treatment for cancer patients.
SKTM operates the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centres in Lahore and Peshawar, with construction underway for a third location in Karachi. The facilities were established with the aim of providing quality cancer care to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay.
Thousands of deser­ving patients have been receiving free treatment every day at these hospitals.
On the closure of bank accounts, SKMT had assured the public that efforts were under way to have the frozen accounts restored and that the hospital would ensure uninterrupted medicine supply to the 75 per cent patients who were receiving free treatment.
Meanwhile, some users on social media linked the matter to Judge Shah’s directives in the case against Aleema and claimed that despite being informed abo­ut patient-related difficulties and Aleema’s appearance in the court, he had not susp­e­­nded his order. Similar claims were made about Namal University’s bank accounts as Aleema was a board member.

Organised by DawnMedia, the two-day summit is bringing toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as the rising population continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.

 

Pakistan, with a population of over 241 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, adding four to five million people every year. Its population growth rate of 2.40 per cent is the highest in South Asia.
The rapid increase is outpacing employment opportunities, with official statistics showing the country will require 104m jobs by 2040. Pakistan will not be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 if the current trajectory of population growth does not slow down.

11:35am — Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal highlights child stunting
Addressing the summit via video link, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed child stunting one of the most painful demographic challenges.
“Countries with high stunting lose 2-3pc of GDP annually. Due to no productivity and impaired human capital, a stunted child earns up to 22pc less over their lifetime,” Iqbal said.
He added, “This is not a health issue alone. It is a national productivity crisis, a national development emergency, and a direct threat to Pakistan’s long-term economic strength and sustainability.”

“I commend DawnMedia group, the Population Council and all our development partners for convening a dialogue on an issue that will shape Pakistan’s destiny more than any other.”
Citing the estimated figure of 370m by 2050, Iqbal termed population growth a “defining challenge for our future stability, prosperity and competitiveness”.
“Every single year, Pakistan adds almost the entire population of New Zealand, around 4-4.5m people,” the minister noted.

11:30am — No more a demographic issue: Shaista Pervaiz
MNA Shaista Pervaiz began her address by commending the participants, lauding their “collective resolve to address population challenges”.
She stressed that “population growth is no more a demographic issue”.
She continued: “It is linked with our economy, it is linked with the well-being of our people, linked with the future of our children, linked with everything a country is judged by.”
Pervaiz noted that while there was “political will” present to address the issue, it was time that it should be “turned into action”.

11:26am — ‘No new ministry needed; have information ministry do awareness drive’
Providing suggestios on how to tackle the issue, Sherry Rehman said the federal government should have the information minister hold an awareness drive in the national language on population and family planning.
“It doesn’t need to worry about having a population ministry. Please don’t have ministries. Please don’t,” the senator said.
“Start putting this on phones, on Androids, on anything. And you will have yourself a campaign that goes into your doors.”

11:14am — There is demand for the ‘C-word, for contraception’: Sherry Rehman
Sherry Rehman stressed, “There is demand for the C-word, for contraception. Contraception prevalence rate (CPR) is what you need to talk about.”
Noting that the CPR was 34pc, she emphasised that contraceptive usage would lower the birth rate and said there was a need for it to be easily and cheaply accessible.
“One province is offering vasectomies to men who are willing to take it up,” she remarked.

 

“Every 50 minutes, before we finish this session, a woman in Pakistan will die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications.”
The senator noted the Council of Islamic Ideology’s ruling allowing birth spacing and said the hesitation was not a religious matter, but rather a cultural taboo.
Noting the high unemployment rate, Rehman said it raised “discontent in the state’s ability to provide a climate where employment is easily available”.

11:05am — ‘72pc of a woman’s day spent carrying water’
Sherry Rehman also pointed out the excessive water consumption, calling for the need to reduce it. She termed large-storage dams “a thing of the past”, noting the lack of financing for them and the displacement caused by them.
“Seventy-two per cent, three quarters, of the average woman’s day in Pakistan is taken up carrying water. Shocking, isn’t it?” the senator highlighted.
“Food, climate and poverty are all impacted,” Rehman, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Forum on Population, said.
“Forty per cent of children under five are stunted,” she added, noting that mothers were also not able to make the health choices that they need to, including birth spaces.




11:03am — Population numbers amplify climate shocks: Sherry Rehman
Speaking about the intersection of climate change and population growth, Senator Rehman said, “With our economic growth dragged down by climate shocks and institutional fragility — let’s not pretend that is not the case —we are not able to lift millions out of the poverty I just spoke about.”
She detailed that if the GDP was already being impacted by multiple factors, such as the recent floods, “population numbers stretch those numbers further”.
“There are simply more people to save, more people to shelter, more people to feed, house, clothe, and save from diseases.”

11:00am — ‘Population growth has passed some kind of danger line’
Referring to Nazafreen’s comments on Pakistan’s “youth bulge”, Senator Sherry Rehman said, “Pakistan talks about this demographic dividend non-stop, but at which point does this dividend become a challenge?
“When you are not able to provide jobs for the 1.5m jobs needed per year,” she said, stressing that “it was a huge number”.
“Population growth, in my view, and I am sure everyone agrees, has passed some kind of danger line,” Rehman cautioned.
“Of course, we love people, we love our births, and we mourn our deaths, but what goes round here is the pressure on our resources,” the senator explained.

10:55am — Sherry Rehman terms population growth a ‘ticking time bomb’ for Pakistan
In a keynote address, Senator Sherry Rehman recalled: “Seven years ago, I wrote about three ticking time bombs for Pakistan — unchecked population growth was one of them, water scarcity, and of course, climate stress.”
“In my view, they are no longer ticking; they have noiselessly exploded around us,” the minister warned.
“They have already done the damage they needed to do,” she said.

10:50am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen highlights Pakistan has ‘young’ population
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, highlighted that Pakistan had a mostly young population, with the “median age of just over 20 years”.
Stating some estimates about the expected population in the coming years, she said the rapid growth directly affects the lives of people and the country’s future.
“It places immense pressure on our health care system, especially maternal and child health. It stretches our education system, leaving millions of children without access to quality learning. It increases the demand for jobs, housing, clean water, sanitation, transport and for energy.”
Nazafreen further said, “We will bring you ideas, detailed reporting, expert analysis and focused storytelling, so that the conversations here reach people across the country and help shape a more informed national debate.”

India is one of the world’s largest telephone markets, with more than 1.2 billion subscribers, and government figures show the app, launched in January, has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone.
Apple, which has previously locked horns with the telecoms regulator over development of a government anti-spam mobile app, is among the companies, such as Samsung, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi bound by the new order.

 

The November 28 order, seen by Reuters, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government’s Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it.
For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the ministry said in its order, which was not made public and was sent privately to select companies.
The government said the app was essential to combat “serious endangerment” of telecom cyber security from duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers, which enable scams and network misuse.
Apple’s iOS powered an estimated 4.5 per cent of 735 million smartphones in India by mid-2025, with the rest using Android, Counterpoint Research says.
Telecom cyber security
While Apple pre-installs its own proprietary apps on phones, its internal policies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before sale of a smartphone, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
“Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,” said Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint.
“It’s likely to seek a middle ground: instead of a mandatory pre-install, they might negotiate and ask for an option to nudge users towards installing the app.”
Apple, Google, Samsung and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India’s telecoms ministry also did not respond.
A 14- to 17-digit number unique to each handset, the IMEI, or International Mobile Equipment Identity, is most commonly used to cut off network access for phones reported to have been stolen.
The government app allows users to report suspicious calls, verify IMEIs and block stolen devices through a central registry.
With more than 5 million downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7 million stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30 million fraudulent connections have also been terminated.
The government says it helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.</p><small>2025-12-01 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01110608b1280a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958504/search-underway-to-locate-minor-boy-who-fell-into-open-manhole-in-karachis-gulshan-i-iqbal' target='_blank'><strong>Search underway to locate minor boy who fell into open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal</strong></a><br><p>A rescue operation was underway on Monday to locate a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole near Nipa in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night.
Images shared on social media showed a horde of citizens gathered in the area as rescue work was underway last night. Other videos also showed the child’s distraught mother calling on someone to save her child.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the service’s central command received information about the incident at 10pm on Sunday night.
He said the boy was with his parents, who were shopping at a private departmental store near Nipa. He said the boy fell into the manhole after the family left the store.
He said that Rescue 1122 did not usually initiate search operations at night due to a lack of visibility. But, since a “highly charged” crowd had gathered and the parents were grief-stricken, officials initiated the search operation, he said.
However, rescue workers have been unable to trace the boy.
The spokesperson said that the search and rescue operation continued into the night for a considerable time. He said that the rescue operation had been halted for now, but officials had excavated five areas with the help of heavy machinery to search for the missing boy.
He said that the Rescue 1122 team had asked the authorities concerned to provide the blueprint for the underground drainage system. According to Khan, the team was waiting for information on the entry and exit flow of the underground water so that rescue work could be conducted at the exact location.
Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger. The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
In September, three sanitation workers died by falling into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood.
In May, a six-year-old boy fell into an open manhole in Karachi and drowned, causing a a protest by residents and politicians which prompted the police to register a case.
In April, the body of a young girl was recovered from a drain in Liaqatabad after being reported missing.</p><small>2025-12-01 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28170621daf2c43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956503/the-crisis-no-one-sees-how-climate-change-is-rewriting-childhood-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>The crisis no one sees: How climate change is rewriting childhood in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>“My son used to be a happy child. Now, he won’t even step outside to play,” says a 28-year-old mother from Sanghar, a district in Sindh reeling from the devastation wreaked by the disastrous 2022 floods. “He clings to me and says that if he goes far, the floods will come again.”
“He fears he will lose me,” she adds.
The mother’s concerns and her son’s fears reflect a dimension of climate change that eludes discussions in policy circles: the psychological toll of disasters on children. While Pakistan has taken steps toward building climate resilience in recent years, this one fundamental gap remains unaddressed.
For many children across Sindh, Balochistan, Southern Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, floods do not end when the waters recede; they simply move inward. This boy’s trauma is not an isolated case; in fact, it shows a much larger, growing crisis.
Based on interviews conducted with parents in Sindh following the 2022 floods, approximately 70 per cent of participants reported that their children exhibited depressive symptoms linked to the fear of floods. Although the study provides valuable insights, research on the mental health impacts of climate-related disasters on children in Pakistan remains limited.
Nonetheless, similar challenges have been observed in other provinces, suggesting that flood-related anxiety and depression among children represent a broader, nationwide concern.
Unmasking trauma
These mental health challenges extend beyond the borders of Sindh, spreading far across the country, into villages nestled between mountains and ancient towns sitting on riverbanks.
Children in low and middle-income countries, such as Pakistan, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and the disasters it triggers, due to several biological, social, economic, and infrastructural factors. The same was also highlighted in a review published in PubMed Central, the premier source for biomedical literature.

 

Yet, despite growing attention to climate-resilient infrastructure and disaster response, Pakistan’s policies largely ignore the emotional aftershocks of catastrophic events.
In Sanghar, the 28-year-old mother sees the tremor of the 2022 disaster in her son every day. “If we force him to go to school in the morning, he complains of a headache or tummy pain,” she sighed. “But the doctors say there is nothing physically wrong with him.”
But psychologically, these aches mask deeper anxiety and trauma.
Unfortunately in Pakistan, mental health services are almost non-existent, and field visits to flood-affected districts reveal this stark reality. The seats of clinical psychologists at local health facilities and the positions for psychiatrists often remain vacant.
Without these services, children and families cannot fully recover or benefit from social protection measures.
Scattered promises
Pakistan’s social protection system comprises initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the Benazir Nashonuma Programme, which primarily focus on income transfers, food security, and infrastructure support during and after emergencies.
They are vital lifelines for many families. But rarely do these programmes include mental health screening, counselling or community-based trauma support.
And this — ignoring psychosocial needs — undermines recovery. It is important to understand that a child struggling with anxiety cannot fully benefit from education or cash support programmes, and parents coping with trauma face additional barriers in rebuilding livelihoods.
Even though promising efforts have been undertaken in recent times, these attempts remain scattered.



In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the government is piloting a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) model in partnership with German development agency GIZ, training a “Hamdard Force” of 500 community volunteers, equipping 80 primary-care doctors to identify and manage common mental health conditions, and deploying clinical psychologists to guide and supervise care.
This is one of the few government-led initiatives aimed at building a tiered mental health system at the community level. As important as these efforts are, they are still fragmented, provisional and donor-dependent, with no integration into Pakistan’s broader climate or social protection policies.
That said, Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and National Climate Change Policy are increasingly integrating resilience planning, structural defences, and early-warning systems to address escalating risks from floods, glacial lake outburst floods, and shifting monsoon patterns.
Notably, the NDMA’s National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (2025–2030) acknowledges the need for psychosocial support in recovery. However, such support is still not embedded as a consistent or well-funded component, and much of the actual service delivery for disaster-affected populations continues to rely on non-government organisations and short-term interventions.
The cost of ignoring mental health
When the mental health of our children is ignored, the cost borne is not just that of social injustice, but also economic. According to a 2022 National Commission for Human Rights report, the economic burden of untreated mental illness in Pakistan has been estimated at $6.2 billion, due to reduced productivity, lost opportunities, and underemployment.
The report also warns that because mental health services are poorly regulated, many unqualified actors provide counselling, thus exposing vulnerable people to human rights abuses, as the state fails to invest in ethical and accountable mental health care effectively. These figures underscore how mental illness is not only a health crisis but a drain on national development and resilience.
Untreated trauma in children has consequences that are seen far beyond the immediate fiscal loss. Persistent anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder can impair cognitive development, reduce school attendance, and limit future productivity, which in turn undermines investments in education and social protection.

 

If Pakistan is serious about adaptive social protection, mental health must be treated as non-negotiable. Practically, this means integrating psychosocial support into disaster response, training community health workers and school counsellors nationwide, establishing trauma support units in high-risk districts, incorporating mental health indicators into social protection targeting, and ensuring that every climate response plan addresses emotional well-being.
Recent climate-related disasters have brought to the forefront the reality of not only rising water but also rising emotional vulnerability. Children exposed to such catastrophes face a higher risk of psychological illnesses, resulting in long-term consequences, including chronic mental health conditions, impaired social development and difficulty in coping with adulthood. If left unaddressed, this burden can accumulate across generations, undermining the effectiveness of broader social protection efforts.
It is therefore essential to open conversations on this crisis — invisible but indispensable. Protecting children is not just limited to the provision of food, shelter, and education; it is also about ensuring their mental and emotional well-being.
The fears of the child in Sanghar, who is afraid of losing his mother to another flood, are not only heartbreaking but also preventable. If Pakistan wishes to build genuine resilience, it must ensure that policies and social protection measures systematically integrate mental health interventions alongside disaster response and recovery efforts.

Pak-EPA enforcement team inspects a vehicle for smoke emission under the ongoing vehicular emission testing drive in Islamabad on Sunday. — White Star

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency on Sunday warned owners of smoke-emitting vehicles of stringent action across the federal capital.
It said any vehicle found releasing excessive emissions will face strict punitive measures.
In a statement, Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zaib Ali said the agency had intensified its enforcement operations as part of ongoing efforts to curb vehicular pollution, which she described as a major contributor to deteriorating air quality and recurring smog episodes in Islamabad.
She said enforcement teams were carrying out regular inspections on major roads, intersections and high-traffic corridors to identify vehicles emitting excessive smoke. Violators would face on-the-spot fines, confiscation of vehicles, or both, depending on the severity of the offence, she added.
Ms Nazia reminded the public that driving a vehicle emitting smoke beyond permissible limits, particularly the thick black smoke from poorly maintained engines, constituted an environmental crime under federal environmental laws.
“Let me be very clear, smoke-emitting vehicles will not be allowed to operate in Islamabad under any circumstances,” she warned. “This is not just a regulatory matter. It is a public health emergency. Vehicular smoke is poisoning the air our children breathe. We will take every lawful measure, including heavy fines and confiscation, to stop this environmental crime.”
She said the agency’s heightened vigilance stemmed from growing alarm over the increasing number of vehicles, particularly diesel buses, trucks, wagons, Qingqi rickshaws and motorcycles that continue to ply roads without proper maintenance, releasing hazardous emissions that harm both the environment and human health.
Pak-EPA said vehicular emissions remained a major source of outdoor air pollution and heat-trapping carbon emissions in urban centres. The smoke released from vehicles contained harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and un-burnt hydrocarbons, all of which degraded air quality and contribute to smog formation.
Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, penetrated deep into the lungs and could enter the bloodstream. Long-term exposure increased the risk of chronic respiratory diseases, heart conditions, stroke and premature death.
The World Health Organisation has repeatedly stated that air pollution is among the top global environmental health risks, causing millions of premature deaths each year.
The statement said Islamabad’s winter months typically brought stagnant air and temperature inversions that trapped pollutants close to the ground, intensifying smog episodes. Vehicular smoke, when combined with dust and industrial pollutants, formed thick layers of toxic air that reduced visibility and trigger respiratory illnesses.
Local health experts said smoke from polluting vehicles was a key cause of respiratory distress, chronic cough, asthma attacks, allergies and eye irritation. Children, the elderly and individuals with cardiac or pulmonary diseases face heightened risks.
Prolonged exposure could impair lung development in children, while medical specialists warned of increased risks of heart attacks and worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Public health data also linked vehicular pollution with higher rates of bronchitis, pneumonia and certain cancers.
Ms Nazia stressed that addressing air pollution could not be left solely to enforcement teams. It called on citizens to act responsibly by cooperating during inspections, maintaining smoke-free vehicles, reporting polluting vehicles and encouraging adherence to environmental laws.
“Cleaner air is a shared national responsibility. If citizens cooperate with us, we can significantly reduce pollution levels and protect the health of millions,” she added.

When asked to specify how long it would last, Trump said he had “no time limit” in mind for the measure, which the Department of Homeland Security says is linked to a list of 19 countries already facing US travel restrictions.
“We don’t want those people,” Trump continued. “You know why we don’t want them? Because many have been no good, and they shouldn’t be in our country.”
The Trump administration issued the pause in the aftermath of the shooting in Washington on November 26, that left 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom dead and another guardsman critically wounded.
A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident.
Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and entered the United States as part of a resettlement programme following the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
Lakanwal had been granted asylum in April 2025, under the Trump administration, but officials have blamed what they called lax vetting by the government of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden for his admission to US soil during the Afghan airlift.
Trump wrote after the shooting he planned to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover”.
Asked which nationalities would be affected, the Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — which since June have all faced travel restrictions to the United States.</p><small>2025-12-01 05:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692cf1dd9c290.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958472/imf-report-light-on-substance' target='_blank'><strong>IMF report: light on substance</strong></a><br><p>THE much-awaited IMF assessment of Pakistan’s governance and corruption landscape has triggered chatter on talk shows and social media. For a report that likely cost the country close to $10 million, it is a disappointment. The information and analysis it provides and the messages it conveys, could easily have been communicated in one-tenth of its length. What we have received instead is a long, self-righteous document whose 186 pages carry far more physical weight than the weight of any original insight or substance.
Much of it is dense verbiage and platitudes — a superficial bureaucratic sputter being presented as a forensic investigation unearthing high crime. Embellished by loads of hearsay it is essentially a compendium of heavily padded restatement and recycling of issues, findings and diagnoses long known to Pakistanis and analysed to exhaustion in the media. There is plenty of development-speak and rhetorical flourish but little that deepens understanding, and even less that charts new, sharper directions and frameworks for reform.
The only quantitative metric offered to demonstrate the scale of corruption — and which set off animated discussions in the media — is the report’s sensational claim that NAB recovered Rs5.3 trillion in the last two years, equivalent to four per cent of GDP. No evidence, source, or methodology drawn on for verification seemingly accompanies this number in a report that sermonises transparency and accountability. In fact, NAB’s own website does not confirm it; instead, it cites a cumulative recovery of Rs6.7tr over its entire 25-year existence. Furthermore, the report does not provide a breakdown of this figure — cash recovered, the paper valuations of public land reclaimed and the settlements reached. And it is silent on the number of corruption cases resolved or on the action taken against the perpetrators of the crimes.
The exaggerated “success” being implied would denote that NAB outperformed every other public institution, including the FBR — to the point where, on the basis of “mobilising” the equivalent of 2pc of GDP annually, we could theoretically dispense with the services of FBR altogether. Yet, in the same breath, the report assails NAB for being seen as an instrument employed by successive governments to hound political opponents. The contradiction is glaring.
The most serious shortcoming of the report is its failure to undertake a thoughtful examination of the policies that create incentives for malfeasance. While it correctly identifies institutional weaknesses in taxation, regulation, SOEs and anti-corruption enforcement, it falls short of confronting the more profound, challenging and uncomfortable question of why these institutions perform poorly. While targeting institutional inadequacies, regulatory gaps in oversight functions and uneven enforcement by those tasked with this mandate, it ignores the policy frameworks that furnish continuing openings for corruption.

A fundamental weakness in the report is the reluctance to admit the role of external agencies.

Institutions do not become corrupt in a vacuum. They are corrupted by the policy frameworks that facilitate discretion, arbitrary taxation, rent-laden exemptions, distortions and subsidies. By focusing narrowly on “institutional inadequacies” and regulatory lapses, the report sidesteps identification of the specific policy choices that create these openings and opportunities in the first place. It avoids probing these underlying distortions.
This omission is hardly accidental. It is for a good reason. Both domestic and external actors crafted the policies, systems and structures that created the incentives and opportunities for corruption underlying the governance failures of the institutions. And many of the very policies that have generated corruption-enabling distortions were either endorsed, incentivised or directly pushed by the IMF and its multilateral partners over decades.

 

The report chastises Pakistan’s opaque, excessively complex and distortionary tax regime — yet conveniently forgets that its bizarre architecture was fabricated on the IMF’s watch and endorsed by it, supposedly its core competence: additional customs duties, regulatory duties, super tax, minimum tax, turnover tax, CVT, deemed income assessments, surcharges, levies and a labyrinth of withholding taxes with multiple rates. In several instances, the ad hoc and distortionary measures and instruments were forced upon the country by the IMF in its overriding quest to raise revenues, regardless of the economic cost to the country. The resulting mutilated structure violates the Fund’s own best-practice norms and global advice.
Therefore, a fundamental weakness in the report is the striking reluctance to admit the role of external agencies in the enduring governance and fiscal frameworks and agendas. It conveniently feigns ignorance of the role played by the IMF and multilaterals under the nearly $1 billion in policy-based loans for tax reforms, complete with extensive conditionalities and technical assistance, which contributed materially to shaping the very institutional structures and systems the IMF is now criticising. There is barely any critique of the distortionary policies repeatedly sanctioned through IMF and multilateral programmes and policy loans — even though several members of the 15-person team that authored the report were involved in these interventions.
For example, it expediently overlooks the multilaterals’ own contributions to the regulatory nightmare confronting businesses and the current dysfunction in the energy sector, and who complain about commitments not being honoured, yet see no contradiction in repeatedly lending to a spoilt child whose behaviour hasn’t changed. To sum up, the report sermonises governance while shirking in practice; sidestepping responsibility for the distortions these agencies, and especially the IMF, assisted in designing. This approach smacks of intellectual dishonesty.
Finally, the report dwells at length on the governance failures of previous governments, strikingly leaving untouched the present set-up’s feeble and compromised governance through law rather than under law (rule by law instead of rule of law), ad hoc regulations, opaque decision-making, arbitrary and poorly designed tax measures. The IMF mentions “data cut-off dates”, but this explanation is unconvincing considering the declared sweep and ambition of the assessment. This selective framing — severe and rigorous on the past, but mute on the present — dilutes its neutrality and diminishes its analytical credibility.

That is why its security and foreign policy has, over the decades, been predicated on avoiding having to deal simultaneously with external threats on two borders. This policy was shaped by the exigencies of the country’s formative years when it was confronted with a hostile India and contested borders on both its western and eastern flanks bequeathed by colonialism. An early conflict with India and continuing tensions over Kashmir was accompanied by irredentist claims of successive Afghan governments, who questioned the border with Pakistan, demarcated as the Durand Line by the British.
The tyranny of geography imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan. But the lesson learnt from the country’s early years was the strategic imperative of keeping one front defused as active military engagement on both borders was regarded as unsustainable. This was not something Pakistan could always control, but its security strategy aimed at averting a double squeeze from two hot borders. This is exemplified by Pakistan’s efforts to prevent any flare-up of tensions with India in the 1980s during its long involvement in the US-led military campaign against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.
It is also illustrated by the post-9/11 decade when Pakistan became a front-line state in the US ‘war on terror’ and cooperated in the US/ Nato effort to defeat the Taliban and terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. India’s military mobilisation along the border after a terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2002 compelled Pakistan to deal with two hot fronts for some time. But US mediation helped to end the Pakistan-India military stand-off. What followed was perhaps the longest period of uninterrupted diplomatic engagement between the two countries in a ‘composite dialogue’. In fact, one of president Pervez Musharraf’s ‘asks’ of the Americans then was for Washington to ‘watch’ Pakistan’s ‘back’ while Pakistani forces were engaged on the Afghan border. The US administration obliged.
Today however, Pakistan faces a three-front security challenge. On the eastern front an implacable foe continues to issue threats and insist its ‘Operation Sindoor’ — the name of its military action against Pakistan in May — is not over. On the western frontier, Pakistan and Afghanistan remain engaged in hostilities. Pakistan also alleges active collusion between Kabul and New Delhi in terrorist attacks on the country. The third front is at home, reflected in the surge in militant attacks that is undermining domestic peace and stability.
This is unprecedented as never before has the country had to deal simultaneously with three fronts. The only bright spot is improved ties between Pakistan and Iran that has helped to address border management problems. This is an encouraging development considering the two neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile strikes in January 2024 over activities of militant Baloch groups on both sides of the border.
Relations with Afghanistan have hit a record low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), that continues cross-border terror attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries and poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s security. With several rounds of talks yielding little, an increasingly frustrated Islamabad was forced to adopt a coercive policy towards Kabul, especially as Pakistani casualties mounted in terror attacks.

Pakistan faces two hot borders and an internal security challenge.

In October, deadly clashes erupted on the border. Pakistan launched air strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan including Kabul while Afghan forces attacked multiple border posts in response. Pakistan retaliated with fierce cross-border strikes. A ceasefire was reached through mediation by Qatar and Turkiye. But subsequent talks ended in deadlock as the Taliban declined to give a written commitment to stop TTP attacks.

 

The border remains closed and trade suspended. Islamabad seems to have concluded that with diplomatic efforts exhausted the only option is kinetic as sustained military pressure might have a deterrent effect on the Taliban’s permissive attitude and support for TTP. This is designed to inflict pain on Kabul. But it also entails costs for Pakistan not only in terms of lost trade (annual Pakistani exports are just over $1 billion), but also in overstretching its resources. Pakistani officials acknowledge this but argue they are left with little choice. Nevertheless, prolonged tensions will mean Pakistan’s attention and military resources will have to increasingly be directed or diverted to its western border from the east, despite the latter front being unstable.
In the face of continuing Indian belligerence and intimidatory military exercises near its border Pakistan cannot afford to lower its guard. With the Indian leadership apparently wanting to avenge its setback in the May conflict with Pakistan, Islamabad cannot leave anything to chance. True, India took no knee-jerk action after the recent Delhi bomb blast. But recently when its defence minister provocatively suggested that borders can change and Sindh could one day ‘return to India’, Islamabad condemned this as “a threat to regional stability”.
Given New Delhi’s hostility and absent any communication between the two countries, a high degree of unpredictability and risk of miscalculation characterises the situation. Pakistan thus has to keep a watchful eye on the western front and remain in a state of military preparedness. The existential threat after all can come from India, not Afghanistan.
While Pakistan may be unable to do much in the near term to defuse either of the two external fronts (ideally the Afghan front should be over time) the home front is what it can and should control. Two provinces are afflicted by insurgency while terrorists are also striking across the country. Despite notable counterterrorism gains, the internal security situation remains troubling with rising fatalities from terrorism likely to make 2025 the deadliest year in a decade.
Pakistan needs a more effective counterterrorism strategy. Strengthened border controls must involve zero tolerance for corruption and criminality that allow militant movement. The government should also evolve a differentiated approach to deal with militant violence in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Law enforcement should be accompanied by political and economic measures to win hearts and minds. Effective counter-insurgency operations in KP require rising above partisan politics for better coordination with the opposition-controlled province to secure community support.
Defeating militant violence ‘within’ is a strategic compulsion as a continuing three-front situation is obviously untenable.

They said that the programme was already approved by cabinet but an agreement was being vetted and go-ahead was awaited to start granting compensation of Rs1 million for the deceased below 60 years and half of the amount to the ones above 60 years. “The summary has also been approved by the cabinet,” they added.
According to officials, the government has been spending Rs37 billion on free treatment of 11 million families of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa annually under which more than five million people have availed free services since 2016, costing Rs130 billion.
They said that the move was meant to further strengthen Sehat Card Plus (SCP), and benefit the relatives of people passing away during treatment under the flagship programme of the PTI government. The programme was approved by former chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur and will be implemented when formalities are fulfilled because it is a policy decision.

 

The government has pledged Rs4.5 billion and authorities concerned have started work on the programme including devising mechanism for distributing the amount to the heirs of deceased people and how the amount will be received with specifications about the share of husband, wife, sons and daughters.
Bereaved families will be required to present a certificate issued by National Database Registration Authority and death certificate by the relevant hospital, confirming that the deceased was the head of his or her family.
“The scheme will be implemented by State Life Insurance Corporation, the executor of free treatment scheme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with which an agreement has been signed but final notification is awaited,” said officials.
They said that the programme, if implemented would also increase hospitalisations under SCP. The free healthcare insurance scheme also benefits those people, who are admitted to hospitals.
Another programme was launched in July, under which free OPD services are available to deserving people in four districts including Mardan, Malakand, Kohat and Chitral. The scheme to benefit 120,000 families in each of the four districts has been started with Rs2 billion financial assistance of the government of Germany.
Officials said that the government focused on free health schemes as under it the number of beneficiaries included 53 per cent women, most those having maternal issues.
The largest group of beneficiaries of the scheme is in the age bracket of 10 to 39 years, accounting for 42 per cent of recipients while 28 per cent of beneficiaries are between 40 to 59 years. The number of beneficiaries in the age group of up to four years is four per cent.
“The new scheme will also ensure financial assistance to the families of patients over 60 years in case of death,” said officials.
SCP has enabled people to seek healthcare services in costly private hospitals in addition to public sector medical teaching institutions without any spending any amount from their own pockets.
“The new plan will also prove very helpful for elderly people, who are bedridden in their homes. People will rush them to hospitals to improve their quality of life as the services are free on SCP and they will get compensation as well,” said officials.

The proposed legislation marks a long-awaited attempt to strengthen national defences in an age where the first strike is often digital. Yet ambition alone will not suffice when dealing with the weaknesses that have repeatedly left the country exposed.
As outlined by the IT minister on Friday, the law aims to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority, a beefed-up incident-response system, and a secure digital infrastructure built under the Digital Economy Enhancement Project. These are welcome steps. But a cybersecurity framework cannot be judged by announcements alone. It must also be assessed against Pakistan’s recent record.
Over the past few years, Pakistan has found itself in the headlines not for its cyber readiness but for a series of damaging breaches. Banks, hospitals, government email servers and even tax and identity databases have faced cyber intrusions, some of which brought services to a halt for days. Investigations into major leaks, including those linked to national identity data, have left citizens worried about whether the state can protect even the most sensitive information. Meanwhile, attacks on energy-sector utilities, such as the ransomware strike on K-Electric, have exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s critical infrastructure.
Compounding these vulnerabilities is the reliance on blanket shutdowns. Internet outages — such as those most recently imposed in Balochistan — often without transparency or due process, have become a default response to security concerns. Such measures not only undermine public trust and damage economic activity, they also reveal the absence of resilient, rights-respecting mechanisms to manage crises. This contradiction is particularly striking given the government’s repeated celebration of Pakistan’s Tier-1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index. Rankings offer little comfort when the public experiences insecurity firsthand.

 

The Cybersecurity Act will only succeed if implemented with openness, independent oversight and a commitment to protecting fundamental rights. Without this, the law risks amounting to little more than an expanded surveillance tool, adding to concerns raised by civil society in the wake of recent amendments to cybercrime regulations, threats to block VPNs and Pakistan’s latest ‘Not Free’ score in the Freedom House internet freedom report.
Pakistan has no shortage of talent. Universities like FAST-NU, where the IT minister spoke, and initiatives such as Ignite’s IC design training programme demonstrate technical capacity. Nor is there a dearth of urgency, especially after Marka-i-Haq, which officials have described as a defining moment. What Pakistan does lack is a coherent, civilian-led cybersecurity architecture that prioritises technical excellence over political control.
The Cybersecurity Act could be the beginning of such a shift — but only if the state confronts the hard truth that national security in the digital era depends as much on rights, transparency and institutional competence as it does on firewalls.

Addressing a ceremony at Jamia Islamia, he said that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam to establish a justice-based system but situation in the country was quite different. He said that it was the fundamental responsibility of government to give people their rights and implement a comprehensive system for a prosperous economy.
“Today the Constitution has been turned into a toy. Powerful groups get laws passed from parliament according to their own interests. The wishes of people are being continuously trampled,” alleged Mr Rehman.







He said that JUI-F was a party to 26th Amendment that was passed last year to pave the way for doing away with interest, empowering Federal Shariat Court, bringing the recommendations of Council of Islamic Ideology to parliament and registering religious seminaries. But even after lapse of a year, the registration of seminaries was still awaited, he added.

JUI-F chief says Pakistan failed to establish friendly ties with Afghanistan in 78 years

The JUI-F chief said that 27th Amendment was passed through a fake majority that allowed every citizen of Pakistan to change gender. “By adding a clause that those under 18 years of age cannot be considered adults, Islamic teachings have been mocked. Declaring the marriage of a minor as rape and calling children born from such a union illegitimate is a grave act against the society, law and religion of Islam,” he added.
He said that JUI-F would never compromise on its principles. He said that Bangladesh made economic progress as the value of Pakistani currency was low than Taka. He said that Imran Khan was accused of following western agenda, but the current rulers were promoting the same agenda.
“Work on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was halted during the Imran Khan government, but the current government has not added even a single brick to it,” he said. He said that generals were given benefits and extensions in service in the past and the same practice still continued. “The registration of seminaries was blocked before and is still blocked today,” he added.
He said that he had no personal differences with Imran Khan rather with his policies. “If a movement was launched against him then another will be launched again today if needed,” he added.
About Afghan policy of the government, Mr Rehman said that during the last 78 years, Pakistan had not been able to establish friendly ties with Afghanistan. “You only know war; this issue will not be solved by you. There should be no war between the two countries. There is no room for armed conflict within Pakistan either. A serious review of policies is necessary for peace in the region,” he added.

KARACHI: While the Sindh government appears to be overzealous about strict implementation of e-challans, the responsibility of traffic engineering remains scattered among multiple entities, hindering the development of a seamless and efficient transportation network in Karachi.
Sources told Dawn that the absence of a unified traffic engineering authority was a significant obstacle to designing and implementing solutions — from road design to traffic signal timing — leaving the city’s traffic stuck in multiple gridlocks.
They said that the challenging task of traffic engineering and management was at present shared among multiple entities, including the Traffic Engineering Bureau (TEB) of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) and cantonment boards, leading to lack of clear accountability and coordination.
Primarily the complex task of traffic engineering, including installation of traffic signals and signs, is the responsibility of the TEB, which has been barely able to maintain the already installed signals due to “constant financial constraints”, they said.
The KDA said that its TEB maintained 90 out of total 130 traffic signals across the city, while 40 by different cantonment boards.
However, the sources said that TEB maintained only 50 out of 90 signals under its domain and remaining were out of order and required extensive repair works.
KDA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the authority was barely maintaining the traffic signals due to financial constraints.
Plan to set up traffic management company
The sources said that the provincial government was considering setting up a new company, to be called the Karachi Traffic Management Company (KTMC), for managing traffic engineering responsibilities of the entire city.
The sources said that the company would be responsible for installation of new signals, repair of signals, road and lane markings, U turns and zebra crossings.
Confiding this to Dawn, the sources said that different proposals for setting up a regular body for improving traffic flow and reducing congestion were discussed at high-level meetings.
They said that the proposed company would be headed by the Karachi mayor as its chairman, with commissioner and experts from the private sector as its members.
They said that that the TEB would be merged into the proposed company.
Recently, DIG Traffic Pir Muhammad Shah had also informed industrialists belonging to the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry about the proposal, saying it had already been submitted to the government and the proposed company would receive a share of challan revenue to fund improvements in road infrastructure.
When contacted, the Karachi commissioner said that the proposal was still at a “conceptual stage”.
The sources said that there was another proposal under discussion to bring TEB altogether under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
SMTA installing signals
While the installation of traffic signals is still the responsibility of the TEB, the SMTA has apparently taken over the task as it said that it had installed 11 new traffic signals in different parts of the city, including Model Colony, Gulberg, Tipu Sultan Road, Gurumandir, Kamran Chowrangi and Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Steel Township Crossing.
SMTA Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto told Dawn that besides installation of 18 new traffic signals, the authority had also upgraded 24 out of 27 signals in the city under an Annual Development Plan scheme.
Moreover, the SMTA has also installed as many as 243 traffic sign boards on different locations on Shahrah-i-Quaideen, Shaheed-i-Millat Road, Rashid Minhas Road, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Saddar.

Zafar Umar

ZAFAR Umar was a writer and police officer in British India. He is sometimes credited with writing Urdu’s first-ever detective novel Neeli Chhatri (the blue umbrella). But some critics say Neeli Chhatri was not an original work and, being a translation, it cannot be considered Urdu’s first detective novel. Other writers often mentioned as pioneers of detective novels in Urdu are Teerath Ram Ferozpuri (1885-1954) and Ibn-i-Safi (1928-1980).
As mentioned by C. M. Naim (1936-2025) in his article included in his book Muntakhab Mazaameen, Neeli Chhatri first appeared in 1916 from Badayun and instantly became so popular that it had to be reprinted many times over within a short span of time. For the next 50 years or so, the novel remained popular. Naim says that Neeli Chhatri was a translation of The Hollow Needle, a thriller by Maurice Leblanc (1846-1941), the French novelist.
In other words, Neeli Chhatri was an Urdu translation of an English novel, which itself was a translation from French. Zafar Umar had made so many changes in the novel that it was a kind of creative translation, often called transcreation, retaining the main theme and tone but adapting the norms and cultural atmosphere to suit the local tastes and sensitivities.
The main character in the original was named Arsene Lupin, a “noble thief” and detective. Zafar Umar named him Behraam and the heroine Ramonde was renamed as Feroza, making them sound local but not Muslim as these were common names among Parsees in the subcontinent.
This made the romance in the novel a little more acceptable as Parsees were considered comparatively more modern by the standards of the yore.
One of the factors that had made the French and English versions very popular in the West was the setting of the story: the historic royal residences and magnificent treasures in and around Paris. Zafar Umar localised it and set the story in Delhi’s historical buildings of the Mughal era, hence making it more relatable to the readers in the subcontinent. This was one of the reasons why Neeli Chhatri’s subtitle was Shahan-i-Dehli Ka Posheeda Khazana, or the hidden treasure of Delhi kings. Zafar Umar adapted the novel to the local cultural environment so well that readers never felt they were reading the translation of a European novel. Neeli Chhatri was a smashing success by all accounts. When Zafar Umar got his own house constructed, he named it Neeli Chhatri. Behraam’s character was so popular that to cash in on its popularity, many imitated and wrote detective novels based on a main character named Behraam.
Zafar Umar was born in Muzaffarnagar, UP, on April 27, 1883. He graduated from M.A.O. College, Aligarh, in 1902 and worked as private secretary, first to Nawab Mohsinul Mulk and then Begum Bhopal. Zafar Umar passed competitive exams and joined Indian Police Service. He translated, with permission from the author, the last chapter of Western Culture in Eastern Lands, a book by Armin Vambery (1832-1913), under the title Mustaqbil-i-Islam, or the future of Islam. In 1911, Zafar Umar published Policeman, a pioneering work in Urdu, a manual for the training of police constables. The book became quite popular. He himself translated it into English and soon it was made a part of Punjab Police’s curriculum.
In 1913, Zafar Umar published a few short stories in Urdu magazines, notably Al-‘Asr, published from Lucknow. These were abridged versions of English novels by Henry Augustus Hering (1864-1945), a popular writer in those days. Translating these thrillers was helpful for Zafar Umar in honing his skills for translating and adapting English works into Urdu at a novel length. Then Zafar Umar found Leblanc’s The Hollow Needle and he turned it into a creative work by modifying the main character and naming him Behraam. In 1919, Zafar Umar published Behraam Ki Giriftaari, a translation of another novel by Leblanc. Choron Ka Club was a collection of stories and appeared in 1922. The book contained four of Hering’s stories that Zafar Umar had published earlier.
Zafar Umar published Laal Kathor, his last work, in 1929, and as put by Naim, despite the absence of any acknowledgement we know it was a translation of The Three Just Men, an adventure by Edgar Wallace (1875-1932).
Some believed Zafar Umar was born in 1884, died in Aligarh and never migrated to Pakistan. But Prof Muhammad Aslam disagreed and wrote in his article on the topic, published in the October 1994 issue of Qaumi Zaban, that he was able to find Zafar Umar’s grave in Lahore’s Miani Sahib Graveyard. The tombstone, according to Prof Aslam, read “born April 27, 1883, Muzaffarnagar, died Dec 4, 1949, Lahore”.

According to the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) Stability Report 2025, the sector experienced double-digit expansion across its major segments, including banking and takaful, with Islamic insurance assets rising by nearly 17 per cent in 2024.
The Islamic Finance Development Indicator (IFDI) Report 2025 — jointly issued by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) — projects that global Islamic finance assets will reach $9.7 trillion by 2029, reflecting consistent global momentum.
Islamic banking remains the industry’s dominant component, constituting nearly 72pc of total global Islamic finance assets, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia collectively accounting for almost three-quarters of the global share. The sukuk market continues to grow steadily as well, crossing $1tr in outstanding value, while new issuances reached approximately $254 billion in 2024, marking an 11pc year-on-year increase.
These indicators reflect the rapid institutionalisation of Islamic finance —supported by stronger regulatory frameworks, broader geographical adoption (including in non-Muslim jurisdictions), the integration of fintech and environmental, social, and governance principles, and expanding global recognition of Islamic finance’s contribution to sustainable and inclusive economic development.

The future of Shariah-compliant finance will not be shaped in boardrooms alone; it will be built in classrooms and research centres

As the industry approaches its 50-year milestone — tracing back to the establishment of Dubai Islamic Bank in 1975 — it continues to expand rather than mature into stagnation. By 2024, Islamic finance had extended its presence to 140 countries, illustrating the sector’s transformation from a niche idea to a mainstream global financial discipline.
This worldwide expansion has naturally propelled Islamic finance into an important academic field. Universities, research centres, and policy institutes across the world are offering structured programs to develop talent for the growing industry.

 

Malaysia remains a global leader in Islamic finance education. The International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) sets international standards through its MSc, MBA, and PhD programs, which are closely aligned with regulators and the financial sector. The International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) offers advanced degrees in Islamic banking, finance, and Shariah law, integrating jurisprudence with contemporary financial studies.
In the Middle East, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) in Qatar provides interdisciplinary programmes combining Islamic finance, law, and public policy. In Europe, universities such as Durham University, Aston University, and the University of Dundee run specialised MSc degrees in Islamic finance and banking, often with strong industry partnerships.
Even non-Muslim countries now recognise Islamic finance as a critical component of ethical, sustainable, and alternative finance education.
These developments reflect a growing global trend: as the Islamic finance industry matures, educational ecosystems are evolving in parallel.
Research centres, think tanks, and executive education programmes are helping to bridge theory and practice, equipping professionals to apply Islamic principles in modern finance, fintech, and risk management.
Within this global context, Pakistan’s financial system is undergoing a profound and historic transformation. Following the Federal Shariat Court’s 2022 judgment mandating the elimination of riba (interest) from the economy — and the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) commitment to a full transition by 2027 — the shift from conventional to Islamic banking has accelerated significantly.
According to SBP’s latest data, Islamic banking deposits now account for over 25pc of total deposits, crossing Rs9.5tr, while Islamic banks’ share in financing has reached 30.5pc. Dedicated Islamic banks such as Meezan Bank, Faysal Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, and Bank Islami continue expanding their networks, while major conventional banks — HBL, UBL, and Bank Alfalah — have substantially grown their Islamic windows.
However, this transition is not only a regulatory or operational reform; it is fundamentally an intellectual and structural challenge. Shariah-compliant finance requires expertise in Islamic jurisprudence, accounting, law, economics, financial engineering, and technology. Without a trained workforce capable of designing, structuring, auditing, and managing Islamic financial products, the shift risks becoming symbolic rather than substantive.
Thus, Pakistan’s Islamic finance education ecosystem becomes the central pillar of the country’s transformation. To support the emerging financial landscape, universities must produce graduates who understand both Shariah foundations and modern financial systems.
Although progress has been made, significant gaps remain. In 2015, SBP supported the establishment of three Centres of Excellence in Islamic Finance (CEIF) at IBA Karachi, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, and Institute of Management Sciences, Peshawar.
Some universities — including Bahauddin Zakaria University Multan, COMSATS, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Institute of Business Management Karachi, Hailey College Lahore, and NED University Karachi — have set up Islamic finance programmes or dedicated centres.
Yet, across most higher education institutions, Islamic finance remains limited to one or two elective courses at the undergraduate or graduate level. This leaves business, accounting, and finance graduates at a significant disadvantage in the rapidly changing job market.
The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has attempted to introduce a national curriculum for Islamic finance, but implementation has been inconsistent. A major barrier remains the shortage of qualified faculty capable of integrating classical jurisprudence with contemporary financial technologies, quantitative methods, and regulatory practices.
To build a coherent and sustainable Islamic finance education ecosystem, Pakistan requires a coherent national strategy. To form the foundation for such a roadmap, academia-industry collaboration needs to be strengthened with banks, regulators, and financial institutions partnering with universities to establish Islamic finance centres, sponsor research, develop case studies, and offer structured internships and apprenticeship programmes.
Islamic finance must become a core component of business, accounting, finance, economics, law, and fintech programs and not be limited to elective courses. Professional certification and continuous learning programmes for industry and existing bankers need to be encouraged.
Research and innovation funds dedicated to Islamic finance research, fintech innovation, case studies, and PhD scholarships can help Pakistan develop its own intellectual capital.
Islamic finance is more than an alternative banking system — it represents a values-based approach grounded in justice, equity, risk-sharing, and real-sector economic activity. For a country grappling with rising inequality, unsustainable debt, and speculative financial cycles, Islamic finance offers both moral direction and economic renewal.
But no financial transformation can succeed without intellectual infrastructure. Embedding Islamic finance into Pakistan’s higher education system will cultivate a new generation of professionals who view finance not merely as a means of profit, but as a tool for social welfare and sustainable development.
As Pakistan moves decisively toward interest-free banking, universities and policymakers must take the lead. The future of Islamic finance will not be shaped in boardrooms alone — it will be built in classrooms, libraries, and research centres across the country.

While the findings may not be new, the report marks a departure from the IMF’s conventional focus on monetary and fiscal policies, traditionally seen as the “intensive care” phase for economic stability.
Instead, the report delves into the deeper, systemic flaws rooted in the manipulation of power and resources by influential public and private actors for personal gain. The IMF, however, remains silent on the impact that measures imposed at its behest have on the formalisation of the economy and in controlling theft of energy.
The GCDA examines several critical domains: rule of law, regulatory constraints, fiscal policy and tax regime, public procurement, and state-owned enterprises. Collectively, these domains reveal a governance system characterised by political patronage, fragmented institutions, and weak accountability mechanisms.
Elite capture and policy distortion
One of the report’s central findings is the widespread elite capture that distorts policymaking and diminishes genuine competition. In vital sectors such as real estate, energy, agriculture, and sugar (and one could think of several others not cited in the report), individuals and groups with strong connections exert disproportionate influence over policy and regulatory decisions.

IMF’s diagnostic assessment exposes how entrenched elite capture and weak institutions continue to undermine Pakistan’s governance and economic reform efforts

Rather than promoting productivity and serving millions of Pakistanis, incentives are crafted to safeguard the interests of a few elites. The report surprisingly omits a discussion on long-term tariff protection that restricts exports and limits choice for domestic consumers. Tariff reforms are traditionally a cornerstone of IMF and World Bank recommendations. The government has declared its intent in this direction, but has faced strong pushback from protected sectors.
Economic consequences of governance failures
The report emphasises that governance distortions result in significant economic losses. The IMF estimates that implementing governance reforms alone could boost Pakistan’s GDP by 5–6.5 per cent over five years. The consequences of inefficiency, resource leakage, and arbitrary decision-making are borne not by the privileged elite, but by ordinary citizens who face inadequate public services, rising inflation, and diminishing opportunities.

 

Fiscal governance emerges as a particularly vulnerable area in the assessment. The report identifies considerable discrepancies between budgeted allocations and actual expenditures, as well as non-transparent reallocation methods. Internal controls within government ministries are weak, and procurement processes remain highly discretionary. The limited implementation of modern e-procurement systems further hampers transparency and increases the scope for human intervention.
Tax regime vulnerabilities
Significant vulnerabilities are also present within the tax regime. However, the report does not discuss the IMF’s own role in imposing elevated tax rates on those already participating in the formal economy, which unintentionally encourages individuals and businesses to seek ways to avoid taxation.
It also undermines scale and growth in the formal sector and encourages taxpayers to seek investment and jobs abroad. This omission in the report highlights a critical gap in the IMF’s analysis of how external policy prescriptions contribute to persistent issues within Pakistan’s fiscal governance structure. The Federal Board of Revenue’s audit and enforcement systems are found to be susceptible to interference, enabling both evasion and selective enforcement.
SOEs and the rule of law
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are identified as a major risk. The IMF highlights ongoing political interference in SOE operations, weak governance at the board level, and a lack of financial and operational transparency. Many SOEs, particularly in the energy sector, continue to drain fiscal resources, with circular debt remaining a persistent issue. The report omits a discussion on the impact of high energy tariffs imposed by the IMF on theft and distribution efficiency.
The assessment of the rule of law is equally troubling. Pakistan’s judicial system grapples with extensive backlogs, outdated legislation, and procedural delays, making contract enforcement unpredictable. This unpredictability acts as a major deterrent for both local and foreign investors.
The political will to reform
To address these challenges, the IMF proposes a 15-point reform agenda. While these recommendations reflect long-standing advice from experts, rather than introducing radically new concepts, key recommendations include digitising federal procurement processes, simplifying and rationalising taxes, strengthening internal audits, enhancing parliamentary oversight, and resolving overlapping regulatory responsibilities. It also calls for better co-ordination among anti-corruption agencies and enhanced anti-money laundering and countering financial terrorism.
The report identifies a lack of political will as the most significant barrier to reform. Implementing these recommendations requires confronting entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo.
Historically, attempts at reform that threaten established networks have faced both overt and covert resistance. Consequently, governance reform in Pakistan will demand more than technical adjustments. Dismissing this diagnosis as merely an external conditionality or for its lack of originality would be a grave mistake. Addressing these gaps must be embraced as a national imperative.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 1st, 2025</p><small>2025-12-01 03:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0108184666cd9d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958445/finance-minister-expects-good-nfc-output' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister expects ‘good’ NFC output</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday warns against an urge for ‘gold rush’ to economic growth and asserted that both the federation and its units would have to contribute greater revenues in upcoming National Finance Commission (NFC) parlays for sustainable and meaningful growth.
Speaking at a news conference, the minister expected the federal and provincial stakeholders of the national finance commission (NFC) would lead to an outcome in the spirit of “Pakistan First” like they had delivered National Fiscal Pact and introduced agriculture income tax (AIT) through provincial legislations. “I look forward to good and constructive discussions with provincial finance ministers and chief ministers” on Dec 4, he said.







He said the nature of NFC was to have consensus mainly on revenue, expenditure and governance and there was no dispute that as a nation the country required not only structural but institutional reforms as also highlighted in the IMF’s governance and corruption diagnostic assessment (GCDA) on the request of Pakistan government.

 

He said it was a separate discussion if there would be AIT collection but it was a fact that for the first time in history, the provinces have legislated AIT. Likewise, expenditures are also required to be made collectively on the pattern of KYC (know your customer) in the banking sector and in line with Anti-Money Laundering Act as Pakistan had only recent graduated out of Financial Action Task Force watch list and could not afford slipping back.

Warns against gold rush to economic growth

That was why the ToRs for the NFC meeting were set in a manner that all the provinces would present their positions and the centre would do the same and listen to each other and take the process forward in an appropriate manner. He said both the federation and the provinces would have to contribute to enhance revenue mobilisation to run the country sustainably. “You cannot run the country on 8-10pc tax-to-GDP ratio,” he said.
“We don’t have to go into gold rush. We have to make economic growth sustainable and for that we have to keep a close eye on balance of payments and current account,” otherwise which finance minister would not like such a key performance indicator, the minister said.
“It is very easy to pump liquidity and have consumption led growth but we would like to have export-led growth,” he said. It was in this direction that the government was making a decisive shift tow­ards an inclusive, private-sector-driven and export-led growth model, he asserted, adding that the PM had set up seven to eight working groups of private sector leaders. He said the abolition of 0.25pc Export Development Surcharge (EDS) after almost four decades was a key demonstration of this commitment.
He said one of the working group had recommended transferring operations of export development fund (EDF) to the private sector and till addressing its governance-related issues, suggested suspending the EDS. But the premier abolished the levy imposed in 1991, he said, adding that a summary had already been moved to the cabinet for formal approval to abolish the EDS.
Shortfall
However, the minister sidestepped a question about the trigger points for contingency measures in the wake of revenue shortfall of about Rs580bn in first five months, saying the revenues should not be seen in the context of targets but a healthy 11pc growth.
About GCD report, the minister said it was part of the government’s broader agenda of institutional strengthening. He said the report had been requested by and developed in consultation with the government through more than 100 meetings. He said the report prioritised 15 key reforms many of which relating to taxation, governance, public financial management, and procurement were already under implementation phase.
He insisted the report’s findings should be viewed in the context of long-standing structural challenges and said the government was strongly determined to advance the remaining recommendations as structural reforms without institutional refo­rms were meaningless and unsustainable. “This is why the government considers the report a catalyst for accelerating reforms rather than a criticism of current policy direction,” he said.
The minister said export performance had strengthened, with overall exports rising 5pc and IT services exports growing by over 20pc year-on-year. He said the IT sector had recorded back-to-back monthly records in September and October, establishing itself as a critical pillar of the “new economy”.
He said the announcement of US Exim Bank joining the $3.5bn Reko Diq syndication, led by IFC had helped achieve financial close for the project following an end to US-government shutdown. He said the financial close will represent a transformational investment that will generate an estimated $2.8-$2.9bn in annual exports once production commences.
Also, the inaugural panda bond in the Chinese market would be issued in December, but no later than Chinese New year. Besides, remittance would be surpassing $41bn this year from $38bn last year, he added.
Responding to questions, he said the government would get out of commodity business sooner the better.

According to a notification from the Petroleum Division, the new HSD price is Rs279.65 per litre, while the new rate for petrol is Rs263.45. The prices will come into effect on December 1.
“The government has revised the prices of the petroleum products based on recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority),” a notification from the Petroleum Division stated.
Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-01 03:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01080248f47e717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958453/pti-to-stay-calm-despite-being-pushed-towards-conflict-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to stay calm despite being pushed towards conflict: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>• Afridi announces weekly protests outside IHC, Adiala jail• Claims Imran kept in isolation and visitors denied access• Alleges KP kept deprived of NFC share since 2018• Special assistant says provincial cabinet to meet every Friday
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Sunday that the powers-that-be wanted to push the PTI into a conflict, but the party would remain peaceful and not opt for confrontation.
“However, the PTI will never hesitate to offer sacrifice,” Mr Afridi added while addressing a news conference at the Chief Minister’s House.
He maintained that efforts were being made to corner the PTI, but his party would continue to hold peaceful protests.
“Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI, and peaceful protesters were even shot at,” the chief minister said.
‘Imran in isolation’
He continued that PTI founder Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and solitary confinement, and that all his visitors, including the chief minister himself and Mr Khan’s sisters, were being denied meetings with the incarcerated former prime minister.
Mr Afirdi said that after some unfortunate news was reported by international media, he went to Adiala jail to inquire about Mr Khan’s health, but even after spe­nding an entire night outside the facility, he was refused a meeting.
He added that they then went to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), but the judges also declined to meet them.
Weekly protests
The chief minister said the PTI had decided all its parliamentarians would hold peaceful protests outside the IHC every Tuesday, and accompany Mr Khan’s sisters to Adiala jail.
He added that the KP government would follow the directions issued by the PTI leadership.
“All the parliamentarians, including National and provincial assembly members as well as senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all proceed to Adiala, accompanying Khan sahib’s sisters,” Mr Afridi told reporters.
He said he decided to hold a sit-in outside Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated.
The KP CM stated that while some chief ministers were offered official jets by the Pakistan Air Force and facilitated during travel, he was placed on the Passport Control List.
Responding to questions, the chief minister said no part of KP was under the control of militants. However, without naming anyone, he added that the entire country was being controlled by a single individual.
He said the Centre should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in KP, adding that decisions taken behind closed doors had harmed the province.
“If the federal government implements what the provincial government has been suggesting, it will be our responsibility to carry out those decisions and maintain law and order,” he said.
He added that the KP government wanted all stakeholders to be taken on board for any decision regarding peace in the province.
NFC share
Mr Afridi said the provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting scheduled for Dec 4 and would fight for the province’s rights.
He added that the tribal areas were merged administratively with KP in 2018 but had yet to be merged financially.
He maintained that the NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, describing it as a “constitutional violation”.
The chief minister also announced that from Monday (today), awareness sessions would be held for students in universities so they could understand how the federal government had treated the KP government.
Responding to another question, the chief minister said that while he personally did not own any property in Tirah, his family did. He added that the recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people did not believe those who produced it.
“People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job… only then will the country move forward,” the chief minister said.
‘Good governance’
Separately, Special Assistant to the KP CM Shafiullah Jan issued a statement expressing similar concerns about the PTI founder’s health. He criticised the PML-N leadership, saying the party had “forgotten its own past”, recalling how its workers met their “convicted leader” in London and sought guidance from him during his stay abroad.
“Today, they are fearful of Imran Khan’s statements and even his photographs,” he said, adding that the PTI founder remained the most popular political leader in the country and that attempts were being made to “block his voice”. Mr Jan said that the KP chief minister had declared emergencies in the education and health sectors and had decided that the provincial cabinet would meet every Friday. “Good governance is among the top priorities of Chief Minister Sohail Afridi,” he added.

AFGHAN refugees return to Afghanistan after deportation.—Dawn/file

ISLAMABAD: Afghan refugees, awaiting resettlement in the US, have urged the Trump administration to resume the programme, saying that they were living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear of deportation.
The statement from the Afghan P1/P2 case holders came days after the US administration abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals indefinitely after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.
“We, the Afghan allies and partners of the United States with completed P1/P2 cases, express our deep concern and urgent plea for assistance. Our cases were fully processed, and we were awaiting our flight dates when, on January 20, 2025, the programme was suspended without explanation,” the statement shared with the media said.
“For more than three years, we have been living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear,” it said, while also condemning the Washington attack.
“This was the act of a single individual, and it must never be used to collectively punish thousands of loyal Afghan allies who served the United States honourably and at great personal risk. Individual crime is not a reflection of an entire group, and we respectfully ask that this principle of justice be upheld,” the statement added.
As Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship deteriorates due to the terrorist outfits operating from the Afghan soil, Islamabad has stepped up the deportation of Afghan refugees, including those who have valid documents. The statement also reflected this concern, saying the authorities continued to arrest and deport Afghan nationals, including “documented US allies”.

 

“Even official letters from the US Embassy carry no protection, and many with valid documents are still detained and deported. If we are forced back to Afghanistan, we will be immediately identified and killed by the Taliban for our service to the United States,” the statement said, adding that thousands of cases that had already been processed were now in a state of uncertainty.
“We urgently request that the United States uphold its commitments, protect its allies, and resume the evacuation process before more innocent lives are lost,” it added. “We are not criminals. We are the allies who stood with America. Now, we ask America to stand with us,” said the statement issued on behalf of the P1/P2 case holders in Pakistan.
In a recent statement posted on its website, the UN refugee agency had also urged Pakistan to ensure that Afghans with specific protection needs are exempted from the provisions of the ‘Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan’ and allowed to remain safely in the country.
The UNHCR confirmed that more than one million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan in 2025. “In the right circumstances, this would be something to celebrate,” said Philippa Candler, UNHCR representative in Pakistan. “But under the current conditions, it raises more concerns than solutions.”

• Banned BLA claims responsibility for both assaults              
QUETTA: Security forces foiled an armed attack on the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the Nokundi area of the district, killing three attackers late on Sunday night. An FC South spokesman said a group of terrorists targeted the FC headquarters in Nokundi town.
“A suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the headquarters, and after the blast, at least half a dozen armed terrorists attempted to force their way into the camp,” the spokesman said, adding that the FC Quick Response Force immediately retaliated and killed three terrorists who had entered the FC fort along with others.
Sources said heavy gunfire and multiple blasts were heard from inside the fort. Security forces, however, successfully foiled the attack, according to the FC spokesman. “A clearance operation is under way inside the fort,” he said, adding that the situation was under control.
On the other hand, some sources claimed six terrorists had been killed in the operation.
Panjgur ambush
Meanwhile, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in the Gurmakan area of Panjgur district late in the evening. Reports indicated heavy gunfire between security forces and the attackers. Officials said several terrorists were killed in the exchange of fire, which continued until late night.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for both attacks.

Abdelatty arrived in Islamabad last night for a two-day official visit and also met President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar earlier today.
The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”.







Egyptian FM meets Zardari
Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today.
A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”.
He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.







According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”.
He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said.
For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added.
The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity.
The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.
Separately, the FO statement said the two exchanged views on matters of bilateral cooperation, regional stability, and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The president appreciated Egypt’s leadership and constructive diplomatic engagement on issues of regional importance,” it added.
Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses
Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference.
Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million.
“With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced.
“These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted.



The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation.
The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”.
The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses.
Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500.
He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”.
The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt.
“Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers.
Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration.
Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations.
Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary.
“They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained.
“Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said.
“We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries.
Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”.
“Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.”
“Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed.
The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora.
Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt.

 

The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University.
“While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings.
The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.”
Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism
At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar.
“We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed.
“The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.”

 

The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism.
“Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added.
Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”.
‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’
The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”.
“This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh.

 

“Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“
The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”.
“It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”.
Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza.
“I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said.
Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern.
Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM
Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”.
“I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels.
“That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said.
“We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added.

Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.”
He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC.
“So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.”
“Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted.
“I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added.

“Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”.
Earlier today, Dar received FM Abdelatty upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Office said on social media platform X.







Abdelatty held a tete-a-tete meeting followed by delegation-level talks with Dar, during which the two sides reviewed full spectrum of Pakistan–Egypt bilateral relations including political, economic, trade and defence relations; cultural and educational cooperation, and collaboration in the health sector, including Egypt’s support to Pakistan’s national Hepatitis C elimination efforts.
According to the FO statement, Abdelatty also interacted with members of Pakistan’s business community during his engagements in Islamabad, highlighting the potential for expanding trade and investment partnerships.
“The visit of the foreign minister of Egypt contributed to further strengthening the longstanding Pakistan–Egypt relationship and provided an important opportunity to deepen cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to continue working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity,” the FO statement said.</p><small>2025-11-30 20:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636587-field-marshal-munir-egypts-fm-discuss-defence-security-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir, Egypt's FM discuss defence, security cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
After repeatedly being barred from meeting their brother, Noreen and another sister of Imran, Aleema Khan, gave separate interviews to the Indian media on the matter.
“These three sisters of Imran Ahmed Niazi sahib, on May 9 they were also present at the Core Commander’s House,” he said, but added that until now they had not been told not to “cry victimisation”.
“If you ask my legal opinion, their presence is proof … They were there on May 9, they brought groups there and it is visible in the cameras that all three are present there,” Tarar said.
“The drama being made today — there is a reason for that.”
He said that the foreign policy success after Marka-i- Haq was not being digested well by the PTI.
“In their era the economy had dipped; it is (now) moving towards an economy of stability. They are not able to digest this.”
“Why are these sisters going on Indian channels and Afghanistan’s channels and crying for their brother?” Tarar stressed. “In the interview that Noreen Khan Niazi gave to an Indian channel, did she say that she condemns Modi? Those innocent children that were martyred, did she talk about Irtaza Abbas? Did she talk about those citizens that were martyred in Muridke and Bahawalpur? Did she talk about those soldiers and young officers who were martyred? Did she pay tribute to them?”
He slammed the sisters’ actions, saying:
“Those who go on Indian channels and defame Pakistan should be ashamed of themselves.”
He added that Indian channels were providing their platform because they knew that “this family, and this party’s mindset is against Pakistan”.
He further slammed Noreen for not condemning the Hindutva ideology on the Indian channel, the cruelty against Muslims in India, or talking about the issue of India-occupied Kashmir.
“Shame on you!” the minister said with emphasis. “That you go on Indian channels and don’t talk about occupied Kashmir, Marka-i-Haq, martyrs, and you go and cry about victimisation about a prisoner who is involved in a corruption case?”
He said that the family was building “hype” in foreign media about the danger to Imran’s health, saying, “Let me assure you: he’s hale and hearty. There’s no issue. He runs every day on a treadmill for an hour.
“This kind of privileged prisoner — this kind of VVIP prisoner who enjoys five-star hotel facilities — you will not find anywhere in the world,” he said.
He added, “If only, Noreen Khan sahiba, you had gone there and talked about your martyred, about that child Irtiza Abbas. About the victory in Marka-i-Haq … if only you had paid tribute to your prime minister and chief of army staff, and condemned Modi … but for you, politics is important, defaming Pakistan is important, and personal matters are important.”
Noreen Niazi rebukes PML-N
Meanwhile, Noreen Khan criticised the ruling party, PML-N, for what she called “double standards”.
“PML-N’s double standards are staggering. They attack me for giving an interview to Indian media, yet Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, has himself used Indian platforms to malign Pakistan’s own military leadership,” she alleged, adding that today, “he and his family sit comfortably in power on the back of a blatantly manipulated mandate”.
“His brother, his daughter, and his party enjoy the perks of authority while lecturing others on ‘principles’.”
She further alleged that “elements aligned with this same power structure shamelessly doctored portions of my interview using AI, a deliberate attempt to distort my words and mislead public opinion.
“These are the same actors who have kept Imran Khan in unlawful, inhumane isolation for four weeks cut off from family, lawyers, and basic rights,” she continued her accusation, adding: “I have never held public office. My only purpose in speaking publicly is to expose the injustice of my brother’s imprisonment and to urge the human rights organisations and judiciary to recognise the systematic denial of his legal, political, and humanitarian rights.”
‘Political-terror-crime nexus’
Tarar also accused Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team of having “ties with enemies of the state”, saying it was now “out in the open”.
“Over 4,000 cases have been registered regarding the infiltration of terrorists, who are sheltered [in KP’s] areas, in three years. But, the rate of punishment is nonexistent,” he alleged. “This prosecution system is under the provincial government, which is supposed to bring in legal reforms and make it stronger.”
The minister said the KP government had been “unable to form a system to prosecute terrorists in its 12-and-a-half years in power”.
Continuing his accusations, he said: “The border is being guarded, but due to the weaknesses and failures of the district administration and provincial govt, infiltration has increased.”
Moreover, “there is a political-terror-crime nexus. The CM and his people are involved in drug trade in KP, they maintain close ties with drug lords”, Tarar alleged. “Within 12-and-a-half years, whose responsibility was it to stop drug money being used to finance terrorism?”
He claimed that the KP government’s performance was “negligible because of the political-terror-crime nexus”, under which “drug smuggling is promoted and drug money is used”.
“They (KP government) don’t punish terrorists, and of the over 10,000 cases of drug trafficking from January-August 2025, only 679 cases have been decided,” Tarar added.
“If the KP government knows of such a large drug cartel operating in its territory and cannot take action against it, that means there is a political-terror-crime nexus,” he reiterated the accusation.
Tarar further alleged that “terrorists attack state institutions but not those involved in KP’s drug trade, because doing so, they’d lose their source of financing”.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/3021480870cdb54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958342/israels-netanyahu-seeks-pardon-in-years-long-corruption-trial' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu seeks pardon in years-long corruption trial</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the country’s president on Sunday for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing that criminal proceedings were hindering his ability to govern and a pardon would be good for Israel.
Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, denies the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. His lawyers said in a letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal.
“My lawyers sent a request for pardon to the president of the country today. I expect that anyone who wishes for the good of the country [will] support this step,” Netanyahu said in a brief video statement released by his political party, the Likud.
Neither the prime minister, who has been on trial for five years, nor his lawyers made any admission of guilt.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life.







Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that the president can intervene when public interest is at stake, as in this case, with a view to healing divisions and strengthening national unity.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office described the request as “extraordinary” with “significant implications”. The president “will responsibly and sincerely consider the request” after receiving relevant opinions, his office said.
US President Donald Trump wrote to Herzog this month, urging him to consider granting the prime minister a pardon, saying the case against him was “a political, unjustified prosecution”.
Herzog’s office said the request would be forwarded to the pardons department in the justice ministry, as is standard practice, to collect opinions, which would be submitted to the president’s legal adviser, who will formulate a recommendation for the president.
Israel’s Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a close ally of the prime minister.
In the letter, Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that criminal proceedings against him had deepened societal divisions and that ending the trial was necessary for national reconciliation. They also wrote that increasingly frequent court hearings were burdensome while the prime minister was attempting to govern.
“I am required to testify three times a week … that is an impossible demand that is not made of any other citizen,” Netanyahu said in the video statement, emphasising that he had received the public’s trust by repeatedly winning elections.







Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three separate but related cases that centre around accusations that he granted favours to prominent business figures in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage.
The prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Coalition allies issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Opposition politician Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon.
Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election.
The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government.
Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges.
He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation.
Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/302125550bf8e3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958336/imposition-of-governors-rule-in-kp-being-seriously-considered-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imposition of governor’s rule in KP being ‘seriously considered’: state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Sunday that the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
Malik said this on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ where he was asked about the possibility of this move and the government’s plans in this regard.
He said KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team had “badly failed in having any sort of a workable situation”. Neither do they want to have any kind of coordination or cohesion with the Centre, nor do they take any action in areas where it was needed, he added.
Given the situation, the governor’s rule was now being “seriously considered”, he said, adding that it was a “constitutional measure”, which was undertaken in case of an “absolute necessity”.
“And I think, the situation in KP itself calls for a step to be taken in this regard so that the presence of an administrative structure is ensured there.”
Asked whether the government had finalised the decision to impose the governor’s rule in KP, Malik said the president had the authority on this based on the prime minister’s advice under Articles 232 and 234 of the Constitution. “And the federal government is pondering [this option].”
However, when it was pointed out that under Article 234 a governor could recommend the move to the president while the federal government had little to do with it, the state minister said the governor’s recommendation was just one option.
“The president can take this step on his own as well […] the approval for which will later have to be taken by a joint sitting of [Parliament],” he said, adding that under the Constitution, governor’s rule could be imposed initially for two months, and it could later be extended further if required.
When asked whether the governor’s rule would be imposed after replacing incumbent KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Malik replied that the matter was at a “very nascent” stage.
Citing “reports”, he also accused the KP government of “planning to block routes and cut off the province” from the rest of the country.
Kundi unaware of reports about potential removal
Earlier today, KP Governor Kundi expressed ignorance about reports of him potentially being replaced and said he would “accept” his party’s decision in case of such a scenario.
The KP governor made this statement while speaking to journalists, who sought his comments on his potential replacement.
When one of them said that “total six names” had surfaced in connection with the matter, Kundi asked: “Where have they surfaced?”
To that, the journalist said they were being reported in the media.
“Now if the media will appoint the governor, then may God have mercy on us,” replied Kundi.
To a question about a possible scenario of his removal, the governor said he would “accept whatever the party’s decision will be”.
Media reports about Kundi’s potential removal have been circulating lately, which the KP governor had previously denied. Back then, too, he said he would “accept whatever decision will be taken by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
Amid these reports, Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week to discuss matters concerning KP, including the imposition of governor’s rule.
At the time, a source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Kundi and gave signals that the government had no intention of removing him.
The discussion on the occasion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation, during which Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal were also present.
Among them, the issue of imposing governor’s rule in KP was discussed reportedly due to a rigid stance by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister on the occasion to provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.</p><small>2025-11-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636583-human-potential-fund-for-pakistan-unveiled-at-oxford-university' target='_blank'><strong>Human Potential Fund for Pakistan unveiled at Oxford University</strong></a><br><p>

“Please be informed that the process has been initiated. PM is returning shortly. Notification will be issued in due course of time,” Asif said in a post on social media platform X.







The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on Nov 27. It will be a dual-hatted position combined with the office of the army chief.

 

Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but November 29 was seen as a critical marker, being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Field Marshal Asim Munir, was set to expire.
Asif’s statement came as the November 29 date passed without any notification being issued to formally appoint the country’s first CDF.
His statement implies that the notification will be issued upon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s return to the country, who is currently visiting London. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Dawn that the PM would return to Pakistan on Monday.
Need for notification
Some legal experts had argued that without a new notification, Field Marshal Munir’s tenure could be interpreted as having lapsed.
However, a 2024 amendment to the Pakistan Army Act extended the tenure of the service chiefs to five years. That change included a “deeming” clause stating that the amendment “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act”, a formulation that legal minds say removed the requirement for a fresh notification extending the COAS tenure from three to five years.
Still, there is near consensus among security and legal officials that the creation of the CDF post, a new assignment rather than a continuation, does require a formal notification. Under the 27th Ame­ndment and subsequent changes to the Army Act, the army chief will simultaneously serve as the CDF for a five-year term.
Therefore, several security sources, when contacted by Dawn earlier, said the government would have to issue a new, public notification assigning the CDF role to Field Marshal Munir.
Unresolved debates
The delay in the issuance of the notification has also been widely seen as a sign of unresolved debates within the highest levels of government. According to individuals with insight into the discussions, one point that has been under consideration is which date will be taken as the start of the COAS’s five-year tenure: November 2022 when Field Marshal Munir originally took command or November 2025 as had been broadly speculated after passage of the new legislation.
Another sensitive question that has been raised pertains to the extent of operational and command authority the CDF would exercise over the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament earlier this month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defence framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision has been the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.

Bilawal made the remarks in a video address to mark the PPP’s 58th foundation day, with his speech being live-streamed in “more than 100 districts” across the country, as per the party.
Bilawal recalled that the ruling PML-N had also proposed constitutional tweaks related to the provinces’ financial rights under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, which were then rejected by the PPP and did not make it to the final version of the 27th Amendment.
“The PPP considers that there were a lot of faultlines in this country and remain,” Bilawal said, adding that the PPP had tried to address those by giving provinces their rights and due representation, and restoring democracy in the past.
“Those people who are trying to play with the NFC Award or the 18th Amendment or other such matters, or are thinking of doing so, it is as if they are playing with fire,” Bilawal warned.







Noting that the government “could see” that the Indian defence minister made aggressive statements about Sindh and that tensions were being created on the Afghan border, Bilawal affirmed: “We will try our best that the internal faultlines in Pakistan are addressed, instead of providing any forces the chance to misuse or take advantage of our faultlines.”
The PPP chairman said that if united, the country had the ability to face any adversary, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and “all sorts of conspiracies”.
Bilawal praised his party for “saving the constitutional guarantee of the provinces’ financial share”.

 

“They (PML-N) wanted to bring back the system of executive magistry; they wanted back the subjects of education and population control that had been devolved to provinces in the 18th Amendment. […] Similarly, the government had other wishes,” he noted.
“I have been protecting your rights and God-willing, will keep doing so,” the PPP scion vowed, adding that his party was ready to support any decision that would strengthen the federation.
“But the PPP can never back a decision that would weaken the federation or through which province’s rights would be usurped,” he asserted.
‘FCC will prove wrong those trying to make it controversial’
During his address, Bilawal also spoke about the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) established under the 27th Amendment — a move the PPP had long advocated for, but was omitted in the 26th Amendment.
“Some people are trying to make this constitutional court controversial,” he noted, adding that he hoped the FCC would “prove all those wrong through its character”.







In a message to those “political forces who wanted to make a parliamentary move controversial”, the PPP chief stressed that it was the parliament’s and the public representatives’ power to enact legislation.
“If someone is demanding that a court or a judge decide on whether the Amendment can remain or not, it is not their authority, and neither will we allow that any other institution interferes in the parliament,” Bilawal warned.
The 27th Amendment and the FCC created through it have been at the centre of a heated debate. The FCC has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s top judicial forum, with international experts and judges having raised concerns over judicial independence.

 

“[The FCC], that institution and its judges have a major responsibility on their shoulders. While representing the Centre, they have to oversee our constitutional issues and judicial independence,” Bilawal said.
He expressed the hope that the FCC would try to “restore people’s trust [in the judiciary] and become a court that will prioritise the Constitution, the law and do justice”.
The PPP scion said it was “definitely his wish” that a Constitutional Amendment be passed through a consensus. However, he highlighted: “If not with consensus, then this work was done through a majority and by the parliament, so only the parliament has the power to review that decision or not.”
“We hope that the constitutional court will look at this country’s biggest constitutional and political issues, and our older Supreme Court of Pakistan will look at all criminal matters,” Bilawal said.
Taking a jibe at what his party deemed judicial activism, Bilawal said he hoped the FCC would not be a court that would “head out to build dams, destroy poor people’s homes, decide the prices of tomato and samosas, send democratic governments home, or disqualify prime ministers for not writing a letter”.

 

“We are about to address a major judicial faultline in the form of the constitutional court,” Bilawal asserted.
He added that this new set-up would enable the ordinary citizens to get “immediate relief” in criminal cases, as they will be focused on by the SC.
“We not only fulfilled the [promise] of creating a constitutional court but also assured the equal representation of provinces in that court,” he highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-30 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636556-kp-cm-alleges-imran-khan-held-in-isolation-since-nov-4' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM alleges Imran Khan held in isolation since Nov 4</strong></a><br><p>

Shadab last featured for the national side back in June during the T20I series against Bangladesh before an injury ruled him out.
Since then, Pakistan have found their main all-rounder in Mohammad Nawaz, who has starred with both bat and ball across past six months as the team won a tri-series in the UAE before making it to the Asia Cup final.
On Saturday, Pakistan won another tri-series, this time at home, after beating Sri Lanka clinically in Rawalpindi — the match seeing Nawaz take three wickets to turn the game around for the hosts.
Apart from Nawaz, opener Saim Ayub has also consolidated his role as Pakistan’s impactful spin option while Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq have announced themselves as worthy specialists.
Salman, however, didn’t rule out the possibility of Shadab’s return when the teams flies out to Sri Lanka — the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup along with India — in the first week of February.
“He was the team’s vice-captain when he got injured unfortunately,” Salman said of Shadab in the post-match press conference.
“And when you have a player available who has played so many World Cups, who has experience, who can bat at number 5-6 and give you a spin option—if we feel he fits, then of course, why not?”
The growing depth in Pakistan’s spin department has been one of the defining themes of their white-ball resurgence in recent months.
With Saim providing regular breakthroughs in the powerplay, and the pairing of Abrar and Usman offering variety through the middle overs, Salman said the management was now confident of tailoring combinations according to conditions in Sri Lanka, where spin is expected to dominate.
“If conditions allow us to play two specialist spinners, or even more, we won’t hesitate,” he said.
“We have Nawaz, Saim, Abrar and Usman — four very different options. Our job is simply to field whatever combination is best for Pakistan. If the pitches support spinners, you may see all of them.”
Pakistan’s opponents at the World Cup will likely face surfaces that demand nuance rather than brute force, a factor that Salman believes could neutralise the trend of high-scoring T20Is elsewhere.
Asked whether Pakistan possess the batting strength to chase scores beyond 200 — a benchmark that has increasingly become common in the format — he was measured.
“For that, conditions have to allow 200 runs to be scored,” he said. “In Sri Lanka, you generally don’t get pitches where such totals are common.
“But if the surface demands it, we have the capability to both score and chase big totals. The players have shown that over the past few months.”
The captain also reflected on Pakistan’s overall progress this year, noting that the side had grown significantly since their disappointing start in January.
He pointed out that despite early setbacks, the team had stitched together a consistent run across white-ball cricket in the build-up to the World Cup cycle.
“Our start wasn’t good,” he admitted. “But we finished the year strongly. In the last two or three months, we have won almost all our white-ball series.
“Now the challenge is to carry this momentum into next year. We have no matches in December, so the next phase begins immediately in January. We want 2026 to be a year people remember — by winning the World Cup.”
With Pakistan currently employing different captains across formats, Salman acknowledged the added responsibility on his shoulders but insisted he had grown into the role after an initial period of adjustment.
“If you’re leading Pakistan, there will always be pressure,” he said. “Responsibility comes with the job. Maybe at the start I struggled to balance my batting with captaincy, but over the last five or six months I have understood how to manage both. I feel far more settled now.”</p><small>2025-11-30 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636534-speculation-irresponsible-cdf-notification-to-be-issued-in-due-time-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Speculation 'irresponsible', CDF notification to be issued in due time: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>
