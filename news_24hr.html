A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and Basant day.
The PTI — a part of the TTAP — earlier also announced its plan to stage nationwide protests today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging.
The party has also announced it will observe a mourning day following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives.
In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”.
He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike.
“It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added.







Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”.
He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.”







The TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar, Abbottabad, Balakot, Haripur, Bajaur, Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat; Sindh’s Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Badin and Nawabshah; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin, Mianwali, Muzaffargarh; and Balochistan’s Quetta, Chaman, Zhob, and Kuchlak.
It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat, as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad, Qila Saifullah, Chaman and Pishin.







On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said.
Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation.
KP
In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest.
A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”.
He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call.







PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders.
PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops.
PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar.
All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana.
In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests.
PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found.
Sindh
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday.
He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed.
But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.”
Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district.







The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town, North Nazimabad, Landhi, Shah Faisal Colony, Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently.
In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent.
“Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.”
He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.”







Punjab
In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”.
However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day.
The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops.







PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level.
Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations.
Islamabad, Rawalpindi
Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call.
These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city.
While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar.
Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops.
“We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said.

Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday.
“I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said.
However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses.
“When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said.
“No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented.
PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities.
A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended.
However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual.
Balochistan
A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta.
All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic.
Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city.
Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads.
In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far.







Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades.
Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic.
The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm.
A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic.
Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held.
Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah.







In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital.
In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”.
In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road.







In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai. Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said.

These formats reward instant reactions rather than sustained thought. Although they offer quick entertainment and information, they also leave many people feeling mentally drained, distracted, and disconnected from deeper forms of engagement.
Co-founder and psychologist at Mindwell Solutions, Namrata Singh Chhetri, sheds light on how constant digital stimulation affects mental fatigue and why slowing down may be more essential than ever.
How has the rise of short-form content like reels changed the way our minds process information and time?
Long lectures, videos, or articles focus on reflection, narrative construction, and sustained attention, whereas short-form content stimulates the brain to quickly determine whether something is ‘worth attention’, scan for immediate relevance, and identify patterns in a matter of seconds.
Short-form content prepares the brain to expect constant novelty. Our perception of time, attention, and even sleep has been subtly changed by short video reels, notifications, and continuous updates. Nowadays, many people claim to be mentally worn out even when they don’t perform any physical labour.
Each reel or clip provides an instant stimulation like a joke, a shock, a tip, a trend, before moving on to the next. Over time, the brain adjusts to this rhythm. Attention spans shorten, patience declines, and anything that happens slowly can become boring or uncomfortable.
Our perception of time also alters as it feels compressed and slippery. Minutes blur together as the brain processes rapid, high-intensity information. This is why many people believe they have ‘lost time’ while scrolling. The mind is active but not meaningfully engaged.
You said many people feel tired despite doing ‘nothing physical’. How does constant digital stimulation contribute to mental fatigue?
Mental fatigue differs from physical fatigue in that it does not require physical activity. Every time the brain makes a decision, changes its focus, or processes information, it uses energy.
Even when the body isn’t, the brain remains active, and ongoing novelty keeps the stress system slightly activated. Because of notifications, messages, and an overwhelming amount of content, the brain is constantly on alert.
Mental fatigue feels worse than physical tiredness. There is no clear endpoint, no time when the mind knows it can fully rest. This constant stimulation prevents deep thought and recovery.
Instead of one demanding task, the brain manages dozens of microtasks such as reading headlines, reacting emotionally, comparing, and responding. People become exhausted at the end of the day for no apparent reason.
What happens in the brain when we slow down or take intentional pauses?
Our nervous systems change course when we slow down. Brain activity changes from a state of perpetual alertness to one of calm, reflection, and creativity. Breathing naturally deepens, stress hormones drop, and the brain starts processing ideas instead of responding to them.
Even short deliberate pauses give the mind a chance to recharge. The brain shifts from threat and task modes, and the nervous system shifts from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest) mode.
At this point, new perspectives emerge, emotions stabilise, and mental clarity returns. The brain and body realign. Hence, being slow is an opportunity for recovery rather than a waste of time.
Can doing everyday tasks slowly, like eating, walking, or listening, have a measurable impact on mental well-being?
Yes, doing everyday tasks slowly, like eating, walking, or listening, has a measurable, well-documented impact on mental well-being by supporting emotion regulation, restoring attention, and balancing the nervous system. Slowing down a task requires gentle, sustained attention rather than continuous observation.
As a result, there are fewer stress-related networks, better attentional control, and less mental noise. Brain regions linked to presence and emotion regulation are activated by simple actions such as eating without interruption, moving at a comfortable pace, or paying close attention to someone.
By keeping us in the present, these moments lessen mental overload and anxiety. The brain is reminded by slowing down that there’s no need to constantly rush. Over time, this may improve mood, focus, and mental toughness.
For people who cannot radically change their routines, what are small, realistic ways to introduce slowness into daily life?
Slowness does not require big gestures. Slowness is most effective when it is small, ordinary, and integrated into daily routine. Consider it less as ‘slowing life down’ and more as providing brief pauses for the system to breathe. Even little adjustments have an impact.
Some practical ways to incorporate slowness into daily life include: taking micro-pauses rather than long breaks, going without checking your phone for the first few minutes of the day, eating meals without a screen, and walking the final stretch home without headphones.
Moreover, taking a few deep breaths before opening a new app, allowing silence during short breaks rather than filling each moment with content, and creating a daily endpoint may help.
How can students and young professionals protect their mental health without completely disconnecting from digital platforms?
For young professionals and students, total disengagement is not feasible. The goal is not absence but balance. Establishing boundaries, such as time-limited scrolling, turning off pointless notifications, or choosing when to engage instead of reacting automatically, can help one regain control.
Mental energy is saved when digital tools are used consciously rather than automatically. Following content that informs rather than overwhelms, and scheduling offline time for rest and reflection, helps the mind stay healthy without taking a break from modern life.

Built in the 1960s, the city was planned as a green city, with wide avenues, parks and tree-lined sectors.
Many residents fear that vision is steadily being eroded, with concrete replacing green spaces.
Muhammad Naveed took the authorities to court this year over “large-scale tree cutting” for infrastructure projects, accusing them of felling “many mature trees” and leaving land “barren”.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) blamed major infrastructure development, including road construction and monuments, for the mass razing of trees and natural vegetation in Islamabad.
Between 2001 and 2024, the capital lost 14 hectares of tree cover, equal to 20 football pitches, according to Global Forest Watch, though the figure does not account for tree cover gains during the same period.
For Kamran Abbasi, a local trader and resident since the 1980s, it feels like “they are cutting trees everywhere”.
“It is not the same anymore,” he told AFP.
“Trees are life. Thousands are cut to build one bridge.” - Smog and pollen - Meanwhile, air quality in Islamabad continues to deteriorate.
Pollution is a longstanding problem, but plants can help by filtering dirty air, absorbing harmful gases and cooling cities.
“Forests act as powerful natural filters… cleaning the air and water, and reducing the overall impact of pollution,” Muhammad Ibrahim, director of WWF-Pakistan’s forest programme, told AFP.
There were no good air quality days in Islamabad last month, with all but two classed as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” by monitoring organisation IQAir.
While some trees are felled for infrastructure, officials justify removing others to tackle seasonal pollen allergies that are especially acute in spring.
That problem is largely attributed to paper mulberry trees, which were planted extensively during the city’s early development.
“The main reason is pollen allergy,” said Abdul Razzaq, an official from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in Islamabad.
“People suffer from chest infections, asthma and severe allergic reactions.I do too,” he told AFP.
The government plans to remove 29,000 pollen-producing trees and plants, according to a recent WWF report.
However, critics argue that pollen allergies are an excuse to justify broader tree-cutting, particularly linked to military and infrastructure projects.
The solution lies not in indiscriminate tree removal, but careful urban planning, experts say, replanting with non-allergenic species – and greater transparency around development projects in the capital.
Capital under axe
In recent months, large bulldozers have been spotted levelling former green belts and wooded areas, including near major highways.
According to WWF and unnamed government officials, some of the cleared land is tapped for monuments commemorating the brief but intense armed conflict between Pakistan and neighbouring India last May.
Other plots were razed to make way for military-linked infrastructure.
“We know that trees are being cut for military-related projects, but there is not much we can do,” a government source told AFP, requesting anonymity for security reasons.
“The people in power, the military, can do whatever they want.” Pakistan’s powerful military has ruled the country for decades through coups and is deeply involved in the country’s politics and economy, analysts say.
At a proposed military monument site along the city’s express highway, WWF recorded more than six hectares of land clearing last year, with work continuing in 2026.
It saw “no active plantation… indicating that the clearing is infrastructure-driven”.
The military did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.
Naveed’s court case seeking to halt the widespread felling, which is still being heard, argues there is “no excuse” for the tree loss.
If a monument is “deemed essential, why was it not placed in any existing park or public place?” he argues.
In reply to Naveed’s petition, authorities said roads and infrastructure projects were approved under regulations dating back to 1992.</p><small>2026-02-08 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0820472944046c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15' target='_blank'><strong>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15</strong></a><br><p>A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials is underway in Lahore on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.
The meeting is taking place at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.
Sources, however, say that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.
ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore on Sunday to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived in Lahore to partake in the meetings.
Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.







According to an earlier PCB press release, the BCB president will also meet with Naqvi.
Islam was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — and other officials.







The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced.
The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.
“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.
A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.
According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.
“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.
Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.
It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.
Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.</p><small>2026-02-08 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649753-president-zardari-says-some-neighbouring-nations-aiding-terrorists-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari says 'some neighbouring nations' aiding terrorists against Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Chasing an imposing 185 to win, Nepal’s Lokesh Bam (39 not out) needed a six off the final delivery of the match bowled by Sam Curran but could only club the ball to deep cover for a single.
It was an agonising end to a valiant run chase by the cricketing minnows, who put England’s premier bowlers Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid to the sword.
Jacob Bethell (55) and Harry Brook (53) scored quick fifties for England but it was a late cameo by Will Jacks that took them to 184-7 in the Group C match, a total that proved just out of reach.
Jacks smashed three spectacular sixes off the final over from Karan KC to finish 39 not out off 18 balls .
Nepal fell just short at 180-6, despite being roared on by most of the spectators in a three-quarters full Wankhede stadium.
They got off to a flying start in their chase, Kushal Bhurtel crunching 29 off 17 balls before Jacks had him caught and bowled.
Captain Rohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee came together at 42-2 and brought up Nepal’s 100 in the 12th over.
Pace man Archer, who conceded 14 off his first over, was brought back and put the brakes on, conceding just six runs from his next two overs.
But the Nepali batsmen took to Rashid at the other end, launching the leg-spinner for 19 off his third over with Airee hitting two sixes and a four.
He finished with 0-42 from three overs.
The blitz left Nepal needing 62 off the last six overs with eight wickets in hand.
Left-arm seamer Curran returned and immediately got the vital breakthrough, ending the 82-run partnership for the third wicket when Airee holed out to Tom Banton for 44.
The wicket slowed Nepal’s charge and Paudel, on 39, then swept Liam Dawson to Phil Salt at deep midwicket to leave them 126-4 in the 16th over.
Archer came back for a final over and proved expensive again, being thrashed for three sixes and 22 runs by Lokesh to leave Nepal 24 off 12 balls for an unlikely win.
Dawson was the pick of England’s bowlers with 2-21 while Archer had 1-42 from his four as England just held on.</p><small>2026-02-08 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08183932e1db431.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971874/gunmen-kill-three-people-and-abduct-catholic-priest-in-northern-nigeria' target='_blank'><strong>Gunmen kill three people and abduct Catholic priest in northern Nigeria</strong></a><br><p>Gunmen killed three people and abducted a Catholic priest and several others during an early morning attack on the clergyman’s residence in northern Nigeria’s Kaduna state, church and police sources said on Sunday.
Saturday’s assault in Kauru district highlights persistent insecurity in the region, and came days after security services rescued all 166 worshippers abducted in attacks by gunmen on two churches elsewhere in Kaduna.
Such attacks have drawn the attention of US President Donald Trump, who has accused Nigeria’s government of failing to protect Christians, a charge Abuja denies.
US forces struck what they described as terrorist targets in northwestern Nigeria on December 25.
The Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan named the kidnapped clergyman as Nathaniel Asuwaye, parish priest of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Karku, and said 10 other people were abducted.
Three residents were killed during the attack, which began at about 3:20am (7:20 PKT, the diocese said in a statement.
A Kaduna police spokesperson confirmed the incident, but said five people had been abducted in total and that the three people killed were members of the security forces.
“Security agents exchanged gunfire with the bandits, killed some of them, and unfortunately, two soldiers and a police officer lost their lives,” he said.
Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Sunday that Nigeria’s security crisis was “increasingly getting out of hand”. It accused the government of “gross incompetence” and failure to protect civilians as gunmen kill, abduct and terrorise rural communities across several northern states.
A presidency spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Pope Leo, during his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square, expressed solidarity with the victims of recent attacks in Nigeria.
“I hope that the competent authorities will continue to act with determination to ensure the security and protection of every citizen’s life,” Leo said.</p><small>2026-02-08 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0818160902d161a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971873/iran-insists-on-right-to-enrichment-ready-for-confidence-building' target='_blank'><strong>Iran insists on right to enrichment, ready for confidence-building</strong></a><br><p>Recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium is key for nuclear talks with the United States to succeed, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday.
American and Iranian diplomats held indirect talks in Oman on Friday, aimed at reviving diplomacy amid a US naval buildup near Iran and Tehran’s vows of a harsh response if attacked.
“Zero enrichment can never be accepted by us. Hence, we need to focus on discussions that accept enrichment inside Iran while building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes,” Araqchi said.
Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year, which stalled mainly due to disagreements over uranium enrichment inside Iran. In June, the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign.
Tehran has since said it has halted enrichment activity, which the US views as a possible pathway to nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
A diplomat in the region briefed by Iran told Reuters on Friday that Tehran was open to discussing the “level and purity” of enrichment as well as other arrangements, as long as it was allowed to enrich uranium on its soil and would be granted sanctions relief in addition to military de-escalation.
“Iran’s insistence on enrichment is not merely technical or economic (…) it is rooted in a desire for independence and dignity,” Araqchi said. “No one has the right to tell the Iranian nation what it should or should not have.”
The minister also said that Iran’s missile programme, which the US would like to include in negotiations, had never been part of the agenda.
President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected.







The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.</p><small>2026-02-08 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08173455ff6b168.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971872/dalai-lamas-office-says-the-spiritual-leader-has-never-met-epstein' target='_blank'><strong>Dalai Lama’s office says the spiritual leader has never met Epstein</strong></a><br><p>The office of the Dalai Lama said on Sunday that he had never met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after Chinese media reported the Tibetan Buddhist leader’s name was mentioned in a cache of files released by the US government.
The US Justice Department published last month the latest tranche of the Epstein files — more than three million documents, photos and videos related to its investigation into the disgraced financier.
An AFP search of the files found the Dalai Lama’s name was mentioned more than 150 times, with no mention of him meeting or interacting with Epstein.
The mere mention of someone’s name in the Epstein files does not in itself imply any wrongdoing by that person.

 

“Some recent media reports and social media posts concerning the ‘Epstein files’ are attempting to link His Holiness the Dalai Lama with Jeffrey Epstein,” the leader’s office said in a statement posted on X.
“We can unequivocally confirm that His Holiness has never met Jeffrey Epstein or authorised any meeting or interaction with him by anyone on His Holiness’s behalf,” it added.







On Thursday, state-run broadcaster CGTN reported that “Dalai Lama” appeared at least 169 times in the Epstein files and mentioned an email in which an unknown sender told Epstein he was considering going to an event the Dalai Lama was set to attend.
The 90-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner fled the Tibetan capital Lhasa at the age of 23 after Chinese troops crushed an uprising in 1959.
He now lives in exile in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala and leads a push for greater autonomy for Tibetans that China has condemned, calling the spiritual leader a rebel and a separatist.
A search into the Epstein files, released by the US DOJ and accessed by AFP produced 154 results about the Dalai Lama.
AFP did not identify any mention or suggestion of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and Epstein.
The email mentioned by CGTN and seen by AFP was sent by a person whose name is redacted, in which they write to Epstein: “About the event I told u almost a month ago on island that dalai lama is coming and I want to go there to see him. But I can skip this event if u need my help today.”
The person writes in a later email: ”…goin now to the event w[ith] dalai lama”.
There is no mention in the emails that the person actually met or saw the Dalai Lama, who over the years has made numerous public appearances across the world.

 

Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution.
He died by suicide in 2019 while in prison facing sex trafficking charges.
Several high-profile public figures have been caught up in the latest US release of the documents linked to the financier, with some resigning from their jobs, facing official inquiries and public questioning.</p><small>2026-02-08 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08173238d672d9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971868/president-zardari-says-afghan-taliban-have-created-situation-similar-to-or-worse-than-pre-911' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari says Afghan Taliban have created situation ‘similar to or worse than pre-9/11’</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”.
He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad, which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology.
“Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying.
Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.”
Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means.
“This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The Sept 11, 2001, attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives.
Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.”
Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack.
President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism.
“Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement.
“The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.”
Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-08 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08154605829f0bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971867/basant-festivities-in-lahore-can-continue-till-5am-on-monday-announces-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Basant festivities in Lahore can continue till 5am on Monday, announces Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced on Sunday that Basant festivities in Lahore could continue till 5am on Monday, extending the previous deadline that was set to end today.







Previously, the Punjab government had given the approval for Basant celebrations in the provincial capital for just three days, from February 6-8.
But the provincial chief executive said in a post on social media platform X today: “Looking at the incredible energy, festivity, unity, and joy across Lahore, Punjab and Pakistan … I am pleased to announce that Basant celebrations timings are being extended till 5am tomorrow morning.”
She said the extension was a “reward for the people of Lahore” for celebrating Basant with great discipline and for responsibly following all safety standard operating procedures.
“Please continue to celebrate safely, stay away from electric wires, secure your rooftops, and follow all guidelines. Let’s make this historic Basant joyful, safe, and memorable for everyone.” she added.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
In December last year, the Punjab government decided to lift a ban on the festival after 18 years, though with strict regulations in place. The authorities also decided to limit the festivities to Lahore, and CM Maryam earlier said that Basant in Lahore was being organised as a pilot project so that “ we can see how effective our security protocols and SOPs”.
According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying during Basant, whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
Despite safety protocols, the Punjab home department’s control room received at least 118 Basant-related accident cases, including six casualties, during the first two days of the festival. The six casualties included four incidents of falling from rooftops and one each when young boys tried to climb an electric pole and a tree to catch kites. About 112 injuries occurred due to twine.</p><small>2026-02-08 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649720-islamabad-picks-concrete-over-trees-angering-residents' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad picks concrete over trees, angering residents</strong></a><br><p>

“Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf paid an official visit to Malaysia and called on the leadership of the Royal Malaysian Navy. He was received at Royal Malaysian Navy Headquarters by Admiral Tan Sri Zulhelmy bin Ithnain, chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy, and was accorded a Guard of Honour,” a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
It added that Admiral Asharf’s discussions during the visit focused on “aligning strategic perspectives and enhancing operational cooperation, capacity building, and coordinated responses to maritime security challenges”.
“Admiral Naveed Ashraf highlighted Pakistan Navy’s contributions to regional stability through Regional Maritime Security Patrols (RMSP) and participation in the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF),” the statement said.
During the visit, the naval chief “also visited Malaysia’s National Hydrographic Centre, emphasising strengthened cooperation with Pakistan’s National Hydrographic Office in training, data exchange, and professional collaboration.”
“The visit reaffirmed the enduring Pakistan-Malaysia naval partnership and commitment to future-oriented maritime cooperation,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-02-08 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6987fdb6d638d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971810/flush-with-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>Flush with outrage</strong></a><br><p>IN the mid-2010s when I went to visit my family in New York, they had installed an electric bidet on their toilet. It was a relief, not to mention kind of cool.
The Tushy was created by Miki Agarwal, half Indian, half Japanese, because she saw a gap in the market. The product was well received by the media. Its sales surged during the pandemic, due to the shortage of toilet paper. One report said Tushy sales were 10 times the norm; it even earned $1 million in a day.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago and Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s newly elected mayor, announced he wanted to instal bidets in the official mayoral residence. Within hours, American media treated this as if he had suggested replacing the Ameri­can flag with a bidet.
Fox News called it an “elite luxury”. Social media went wild, albeit with some hilarious memes. One Democratic insider told a reporter that the socialist mayor thinks he’s “flush with cash” to buy bidets.

 

I was surprised. We’re talking about bidets. Basic hygiene. And yet, this has become a referendum on American values, elitism and what counts as appropriately patriotic bathroom behaviour. But in America, a brown man with a non-Western name expressing a preference rooted in his cultural background is treated as a newsworthy scandal rather than routine home improvement.
What’s really being said here? We know it’s not about the bidet. It’s about what gets coded as ‘normal’ versus ‘other’ in Western discourse.
When an American politician renovates a bathroom with marble, it’s not news. When an American Muslim mayor mentions installing a bidet, it becomes a crisis of values. The disconnect is wild.
Americans will spend hundreds of dollars on face creams, luxury bath products, and water bottles that cost more than a bidet attachment. But suggest using water after using the toilet and suddenly it’s too much. The same country that invented the $20,000 trashcan finds bidets extravagant.
The controversy is just the latest example of how the US media has treated Mamdani’s tenure since he announced he was running. When he announced his housing plan to convert vacant office buildings into affordable apartments, the New York Post called it “socialist fantasy”. When he proposed free subway rides for low-income New Yorkers, Fox News had an entire segment on “who’s paying for freeloaders”. When he attended a Diwali celebration at City Hall — as his predecessors did for years — the media asked whether he was “pandering to ethnic communities”.

Is it a ‘new era of cleanliness’ or an ‘elite luxury’?

It’s equally striking to see how resistance to Mamdani has evolved. Early coverage focused on whether a democratic socialist could govern effectively. These are the kinds of questions that journalists should ask. But as his policies have gained traction, the criticism has shifted from substance to style, from governance to optics, from what he does to who he is.
The media then settled into a comfortable narrative: Mamdani is too radical, too foreign, irrespective of what he proposes. His background is the story rather than his policies. A bidet becomes evidence of elitism. Attending cultural events becomes identity politics. Speaking about his immigrant parents becomes playing the ethnic card.
This is the exhausting reality for politicians of colour in America: your competence is perpetually questioned, your motives are perpetually suspect, and your cultural identity is perpetually on trial. You can’t just be a mayor; you must constantly prove you’re American enough, normal enough, unthreatening enough.

 

And yet, despite the media hysteria, Mamdani’s approval ratings remain solid. They were 48 per cent at the end of January 2026, the highest they’ve ever been, according to Newsweek. People appreciate his policies — from raising taxes on the wealthiest to raising minimum wage to $30 an hour. Many supported him after the bidet comment saying “a new era of cleanliness in New York begins”. Even a proctologist weighed in saying from a hygiene perspective “[a bidet] just clearly makes sense”.
The gap between media coverage and public reception is growing. Perhaps that’s the real story here. Not that the media lost its mind over a bathroom fixture, but that increasingly, Americans themselves aren’t buying the outrage. Fox News et al. will move on to the next manufactured outrage. Mamdani may or may not get his bidets. But the message has been sent: even as mayor of the largest US city, your cultural background will be scrutinised more than your policies.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world will continue using water, unbothered by US anxiety about basic hygiene. We figured this out generations ago. Perhaps one day the US media will catch up. Until then, we’ll keep watching them agonise over bathroom fixtures while pretending it’s about anything other than discomfort with difference.

After Afghanistan made 182-6, New Zealand were driven by Seifert’s 42-ball knock and 42 by Glenn Phillips to achieve their target with 13 balls to spare in Chennai.
New Zealand’s previous best chase in the T20 World Cup was their 167 against England in the 2021 semi-final.
Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman had New Zealand in early trouble when he struck on successive balls in the second over of the chase to dismiss Finn Allen, for one, and Rachin Ravindra, for a duck.
The hat-trick was avoided by Phillips, who then got going with wicketkeeper Seifert in a partnership of 74 for the third wicket to thwart Afghanistan’s spin-heavy attack.
Captain Rashid Khan let out a roar as he broke through to dismiss Phillips, who inside-edged onto his stumps.
Leg-spinner Rashid dropped Seifert on 48 off his own bowling, and the batsman reached his fifty with a six off veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi.
Seifert hit Nabi for another six and a four on successive balls before the bowler had his revenge on the next when he top-edged to be caught in the deep.
Mark Chapman fell after a 17-ball 28, but Daryl Mitchell, on 25, and skipper Mitchell Santner, on 17, saw New Zealand to 183-5 and a comfortable victory.
Afghanistan won the toss and chose to bat, and Gulbadin Naib, coming in at number three, struck 63 off 35 balls after they had slipped to 44-2.
Matt Henry nearly had Rahmanullah Gurbaz caught after he skied a top edge behind the stumps, but keeper Seifert and Allen collided as they both ran back, and the chance went begging.
Pace bowler Lockie Ferguson struck twice in his opening over to send back Ibrahim Zadran, for 10, and then Gurbaz, bowled for 27 off an inside edge.
Naib and left-hander Sediqullah Atal, who made 29, got together to rebuild the innings with a 79-run stand for the third wicket.
Naib reached his fourth T20 fifty off 29 balls before he departed attempting a slog off left-arm spinner Rachin Ravindra.</p><small>2026-02-08 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/081017193a83be1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971847/china-condemns-islamabad-imambargah-attack-says-it-supports-pakistan-in-safeguarding-national-security' target='_blank'><strong>China condemns Islamabad imambargah attack, says it supports Pakistan in safeguarding national security</strong></a><br><p>China condemned on Sunday the deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad earlier this week, asserting that it “firmly supports” the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability.
“China is deeply shocked by the deadly explosion in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad and the heavy casualties it has inflicted. China mourns for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones.
“China strongly condemns the attack, opposes any form of terrorism and firmly supports the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability and protecting the safety of the people,” a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said.







Turkiye FM offers condolences over loss of life
Separately, in a phone call with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan conveyed “heartfelt condolences on behalf of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, himself, and the brotherly people of Turkiye” over the loss of life in the attack, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
FM Dar “thanked the Turkish leadership for their solidarity and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unshaken resolve to combat terrorism and protect its civilians,” according to the statement.
“Both leaders also exchanged views on bilateral relations, matters of mutual interest, and key regional and international developments,” the FO added.







The attack
The attack took place inside the mosque at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra, located in the Tarlai area of what is considered ‘rural Islamabad’, off Lehtrar Road on Friday. It left over 30 people dead and more 100 injured.
Police officials said the blast occurred after Friday prayers, adding that the attacker was stopped at the gate of the mosque, where he detonated his explosive payload.
Footage and photos from the blast site showed several bodies lying near the mosque’s front gate, with people and debris also strewn across the red-carpeted prayer hall.
Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the mosque as people called for help.
The brazen attack elicited an outpouring of grief from across the country, and prompted condemnations from most world capitals, as well as local political and religious groups.

 

Authorities have pointed fingers at Afghanistan and India as the investigation into the incident continues.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said yesterday that four facilitators behind the suicide bombing, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said multiple agencies launched an investigation immediately after the blast and carried out operations overnight. “I want to praise our agencies and the Counter-Terrorism Department in KP that all the people who were linked to the blast, including the masterminds, were arrested before 3am,” he added.
After the blast, raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera and the facilitators and the mastermind were arrested.
Naqvi claimed that the mastermind was an Afghan national, affiliated with the militant Islamic State (IS) group. “The terrorist involved in the incident got training in Afghanistan. How he was trained, his travel history tells everything,” Naqvi said.
A KP police assistant sub-inspector was martyred during the overnight raids, while several personnel were injured, the minister added.
He stressed that the network had been dismantled. “The entire ISIS network has been busted,” he said.
Naqvi claimed there were at least “21 terrorist organisations” operating from Afghanistan. He alleged that the mercenaries shifted allegiance “to whoever paid them more”.
“Someone is giving them funds, and they are getting dollars from somewhere,” he said, alleging India was providing funding and targets. “Those who were giving $500 are now giving $1,500… India has increased the funding three times after May,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-08 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649694-groom-to-be-martyred-while-stopping-suicide-bomber-in-islamabad-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Groom-to-be martyred while stopping suicide bomber in Islamabad blast</strong></a><br><p>

The US and India moved closer to a trade pact on Friday, announcing a framework for a deal they hope to conclude by March that would lower tariffs and deepen economic cooperation.
Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Reliance Industries are not accepting offers from traders for Russian oil loading in March and April, said a trader who approached the refiners.
These refiners, however, had already scheduled some deliveries of Russian oil in March, refining sources said. Most other refiners have stopped buying Russian crude.
Trump says India ‘committed’ to halting purchases
The three refiners and the oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The trade minister on Saturday referred questions about Russian oil to the foreign ministry.
A foreign ministry spokesperson said: “Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy” to ensure energy security for the world’s most-populous nation.
Although a US-India statement on the trade framework did not mention Russian oil, President Donald Trump rescinded his 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, imposed over Russian oil purchases, because, he said, New Delhi had “committed to stop directly or indirectly” importing Russian oil.
New Delhi has not announced plans to halt Russian oil imports.
India became the top buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, spurring a backlash from Western nations that had targeted Russia’s energy sector with sanctions aimed at curtailing Moscow’s revenue and making it harder to fund the war.
India’s Russian-oil imports a fraction of 2025 levels
One regular Indian buyer is Russia-backed private refiner Nayara, which relies solely on Russian oil for its 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery. Sources said Nayara may be allowed to keep buying Russian oil because other crude sellers pulled back after the European Union sanctioned the refiner in July.
Nayara also does not plan to import Russian crude in April due to a month-long refinery maintenance shutdown, a source familiar with its operations said.
Nayara did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Indian refiners may change their plan and place orders for Russian oil only if advised by the government, sources said.
Trump’s order said US officials would monitor and recommend reinstating the tariffs if India resumed oil procurement from Russia.
Sources said last month that India was preparing to cut Russian oil imports below one million bpd by March, with volumes eventually falling to 500,000–600,000 bpd, compared with an average 1.7m bpd last year. India’s Russian oil imports topped 2m bpd in mid-2025.
The intake of Russian oil by India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer and importer, declined to its lowest level in two years in December, data from trade and industry sources show.
Indian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American countries as they scale back Russian oil purchases.</p><small>2026-02-08 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649686-pdma-issues-alert-as-rain-snowfall-forecast-in-kp-and-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>PDMA issues alert as rain, snowfall forecast in KP and Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

According to the sources, Islamabad received the invitation as part of the outreach to countries that have already joined the board, which was launched by Trump late last month. The meeting is expected to focus on giving formal shape to the board, including its structure, mandate and secretariat, the sources said.

 

“This will be a key meeting aimed at giving a shape and structure to the board,” one diplomatic source said. Asked whether Pakistan could be approached to contribute troops to a proposed international stabilisation force for Gaza, the source said such discussions were premature.
“That would come later. First, we have to give shape to the board, form a structure, set up a secretariat and define its direction,“ he added.
Another source also said it was “still too early” for any discussion on troop contributions.
Pakistan is among the 14 countries that signed the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.
A controversial initiative
The White House has proposed holding the first BoP meeting at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, according to an Axios report citing a US official and diplomats from four participating countries. The plans, which include a fundraising component for Gaza’s reconstruction, remain at an early stage and could still change.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Trump at the White House on Feb 18, a day before the planned board meeting.
Trump, who will chair the body, has said the Board of Peace will aim to resolve global conflicts — a claim that has alarmed many experts, who fear the initiative could undermine the United Nations and existing multilateral mechanisms.
While several Middle Eastern allies of Washington have joined the board, many of the US’s traditional Western allies have so far stayed away, reflecting unease over both its structure and mandate.
Pakistan’s calculus
For Pakistan, participation in the meeting reflects a cautious but deliberate diplomatic choice. As a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights, Islamabad has sought to remain engaged in international discussions on Gaza, while avoiding initiatives that could legitimise external control over the Palestinian territory.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.

 

However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations. Since October, more than 550 Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Israel’s assaults on Gaza since October 2023 have killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced the entire population and triggered a severe humanitarian crisis. Multiple rights organisations, scholars and a UN inquiry have said the campaign amounts to genocide — an allegation Israel denies.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance before being expanded to address global conflicts.
Rights experts and scholars have criticised the concept, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.
For Pakistan, attendance at the inaugural meeting does not necessarily signal endorsement of the board’s broader vision. Instead, officials suggest Islamabad sees value in remaining present at a forum that could influence Gaza’s future — while reserving its position on key issues such as governance, accountability and any potential military role.
As the Board of Peace takes shape, Pakistan’s challenge will be to balance diplomatic engagement with its stated commitment to Palestinian self-determination and international law — a line that is likely to come under increasing pressure as the initiative moves from concept to implementation.</p><small>2026-02-08 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971808/kashmir-unresolved' target='_blank'><strong>Kashmir unresolved</strong></a><br><p>TIES between Pakistan and India are perhaps at their lowest point since Partition. Bilateral interaction is close to zero, while Pakistan has strong reasons to believe that its eastern neighbour is playing a key role in fomenting terrorism within its borders. This is unsustainable in the long run, as the threat of conflict is never far away when such a massive gulf of mistrust exists.
And while India keeps harping on about the main obstacle to better ties being ‘terrorism’, which it alleges emanates from Pakistan, it is India which is bringing terrorism to this country.

 

Meanwhile, the main flashpoint in South Asia remains the unresolved question of Kashmir. Though New Delhi would like to believe its own fiction that the Kashmir dispute has been ‘resolved’ by the scrapping of the occupied territory’s limited autonomy in 2019, the fact remains that internationally, Kashmir remains a disputed region.
The lack of resolution of the Kashmir question results in a state of permanent insecurity in the subcontinent.
We must not forget that both states fought a limited war after the Pahalgam episode last year. The threat of fresh conflict is ever-present as long as the dispute is not judiciously settled.
Moreover, Indian repression in occupied Kashmir continues unabated. And when events such as Pahalgam occur, the plight of Kashmiris in the held region, as well as in India, becomes even more acute. They are punished doubly; because of their Kashmiri origin, as well as their Muslim faith.

 

Human Rights Watch has documented Hindu mob attacks in India after the Pahalgam assault in which Kashmiri students and workers were targeted in various Indian states. UN human rights experts have reached similar conclusions. Furthermore, the UN experts have condemned “arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture … lynchings” of Muslims including Kashmiris. These grim facts reveal the true face of the ‘world’s largest democracy’.
Pakistan has consistently sought to bring India to the table in order to resolve the Kashmir question. Yet India, particularly under Narendra Modi, has arrogantly rejected the invitation.
While New Delhi abhors the thought of third-party meditation in Kashmir, it is time international actors paid more attention to the issue.

 

US President Donald Trump has on several occasions said he is willing to step in and help resolve the dispute. Last year, he claimed to have “stopped the war” between Pakistan and India, while adding that “I can solve anything”. He is welcome to try, perhaps using his Board of Peace as a platform to address the Kashmir issue. While the Indians talk tough, they will have a hard time resisting US pressure, as their recent ‘commitment’ to stop buying Russian oil shows.

A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, Dawn has learnt.
According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.
Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.

Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal

Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.
The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.
The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.
On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.
PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.
In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.
In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.
In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.
Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.

The objections were raised during a marathon public hearing convened by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to seek feedback on its proposed Prosumers Regulations 2025, which aim to significantly reduce incentives for net-metering solar consumers. Although Nepra itself proposed the draft regulations, their defence was largely mounted by the Power Division and its utilities, including distribution companies and K-Electric.
Participants at the hearing included think tanks, politicians, chambers of commerce, solar installers, service providers, industrialists and domestic consumers, many of whom argued that the proposed changes would undermine Pakistan’s clean energy transition.
The draft regulations envisage drastic revisions to the existing framework; however, stakeholders were barred from presenting alternative proposals. Nepra’s former member (law) Amina Ahmed, who assumed charge as member finance and technical for the next three years on Friday, directed commentators to confine their remarks strictly to the draft regulations and refrain from suggesting alternatives.

Critics warn proposed solar rules threaten clean energy drive and consumer rights

The regulator also declined a request from Pakistan Peoples Party leader Nadeem Afzal Chan for a live telecast of the public hearing on television or social media platforms to allow broader public participation, even if limited to pre-registered speakers.
Several chambers of commerce and industry demanded that hearings on an issue of such national importance should not be confined to a single session in Islamabad and called for similar consultations in all four provincial capitals. Nepra did not respond to these demands.
Several interveners complained that, despite the regulator seeking only feedback, distribution companies had already stopped accepting new solar applications and were discouraging online registrations through various means. They also alleged that some Discos had stopped accounting for electricity supplied by existing prosumers and were charging them at full rates.
Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar and Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar declared such unilateral actions illegal and assured participants they would not be allowed to continue.
They said the Power Division should have acted in line with assurances previously given by the power minister, adding that the regulator would ensure reversal of these measures and take strict action against those responsible. The chairman sought a detailed report from Discos.
While the Power Division and its entities were given about 1.5 hours to explain the proposed changes, other commentators were limited to three minutes each. The hearing lasted more than three hours.
The Power Division informed the forum that existing registered prosumers would be shifted from net-metering to net-billing, with export units credited for only one month instead of the current three. All other contractual terms would remain unchanged until the expiry of their seven-year agreements.
Under the proposed rules, new prosumers would be offered five-year contracts, with export units purchased at Rs11 per unit, compared to around Rs26 per unit under existing arrangements.
Mr Chan said his party would challenge the proposed regulations, alleging that the power system was corrupt, inefficient, unreliable and unaffordable, while solar solutions had empowered farmers and small rural businesses such as tailors, welders and tyre shops. He alleged widespread payment of speed money and claimed consumers were forced to repair faulty transformers at their own expense, even though it was the utilities’ responsibility. He argued that people’s initiative to adopt solar energy should be protected rather than discouraged.
Think tanks warned that the proposed regulations contradicted Pakistan’s international commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and would undermine efforts to reduce emissions, enhance energy security, save foreign exchange and improve industrial competitiveness. They suggested that the government should purchase surplus solar power and earn carbon credits estimated at $40 million annually.
The Power Division maintained that the government was not discouraging solar adoption but sought sustainable growth while addressing misuse. It said Pakistan’s clean energy share had increased from 40pc in 2015 to 55pc in 2025, with on-grid solar capacity reaching 7,000 megawatts and off-grid systems exceeding 13,000MW.
However, officials argued that rapid solar penetration had created grid stability challenges, including steep ramp-up and ramp-down requirements, voltage and backfeed issues, necessitating regulatory intervention.

During these operations, which started last Saturday, they said the security forces killed as many as 216 terrorists, while the bodies of five laborers were found during combing operation in Nushki.
The bodies of labourers, who hailed from Sindh, were shifted to Quetta. They would be handed over to their families, the officials said.
Besides, almost all highways, except Quetta-Taftan and Nushki Taftan highways, were opened for traffic, which remained closed for a few days, the officials said.

Traffic between Quetta and Nushki has been restored after the damaged road was repaired. People have been informed that they could travel betw­een Quetta and Nushki from 6am to 5pm, but cautioned against night travel.
However, the authorities said that the highway from Nushki to Taftan was still closed. They said the terrorists during the attack in Nushki had planted landmines at different places on the highway.
Security forces were combing the highway from landmines, while the NHA and other departments concerned were repairing the road after which traffic would be allowed to resume.

As the holy month will get underway from the third week of this month, fruit vendors have already started charging higher rates for the most sought-after items like banana, apple and guava. In the flour industry, retailers blame millers for raising rates, while flour millers flatly reject the claim.
As the new Sindh wheat crop will arrive in March, a random market survey ahead of the holy month reveals a price hike in a 20 kg bag of wheat flour to Rs2,500-2,700 from Rs2,400-2,600 two weeks back, followed by a Rs141 per kg increase in fine flour, up from Rs133 per kg.
The Sensitive Price Index ending Feb 4 revealed a slight jump in the price of a 10kg bag of wheat to Rs1,100 from Rs1,050 two weeks back.

Vegetable, fruit and flour prices rise ahead of holy month

Roti makers also complained about a price hike of Rs450 per 50 kg in the fine flour bag, from Rs6,000 to Rs6,450, which may result in a price jump in Roti varieties if the fine flour bag crosses Rs7,000 per 50 kg.
Currently, roti makers have kept the rates of various roti varieties unchanged. Consumers believe that some tandoor operators have reduced the weight of roti varieties while keeping prices unchanged. Naan and Chappati are available at Rs25 and Rs15 per piece, respectively.
Disagreeing over the price rise in flour, Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Sindh Zone, Chairman Abdul Junaid Aziz said that the 100kg wheat bag rate has declined to Rs10,900 from Rs11,600. As a result, the ex-mill rate of flour No.2.5 and fine is Rs104 and Rs114 from December 2025.
“There is no price increase or any shortage of wheat or flour varieties in the markets,” he said, claiming that the Association mainly focuses on flour No 2.5 instead of the commercially popular fine and maida (super fine flour) rates.
The Sindh government in December 2025 reduced the wheat issue price to Rs8,000 per 100 kg bag from Rs9,500 to stabilise prices for the consumers and provide grain to the millers and traders.
“Millers are lifting wheat from the open market at the rate of Rs11,600 per 100 kg bag for blending with the government’s wheat of the 2022-2024 crop,” Junaid said, showing some concerns over the government’s wheat quality, as a lack of gluten usually results in low protein and also creates problems in making a soft roti. As a result, millers procure new wheat crops from the open market for blending with old wheat to maintain quality.
On high rates of branded flour, he said the association cannot control the rates charged by branded flour makers, which are very few in number, and that their market share is only 5 per cent.
One of the reasons for the high prices of branded flour is their prime quality and the bag cost alone, which hover between Rs80-100 per bag in 5 kg and 10 kg packs, he said.
Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association Chairman Rauf Ibrahim said the rates of black gram, Kabuli channa (white gram) and basen is Rs205, Rs310 and Rs205, while in retail markets, they are being sold at Rs250-280, Rs350-400 and Rs350-400 per kg.
Rauf said the rates of masoor, moong and gram pulse have been unchanged at Rs240-300, Rs360-400 and Rs240-280 per kg as against a slight increase in mash pulse to Rs380-460 from Rs360-420 prevailing two weeks back.
Tomato and onions
Potato and onion rates have risen to Rs40-70 and Rs50-80 per kg, respectively, over the last two weeks, as against a sharp rise in tomato prices to Rs70-100 from Rs30-40 two weeks back. Sugar rates, as per SPI data, fell to Rs145-160 per kg from Rs150-170 per kg.
“The city government should focus on the retail side during Ramazan, where consumers face real hardship at the hands of retailers,” Rauf said.
Fruits getting costlier
Various varieties of fruits have become costlier by Rs50-100. Banana rates have surged to Rs150-200 per dozen from Rs100-150.
Fruit vendors are also demanding an extra Rs50-100 per kg on various varieties of apples ahead of Ramazan. Green and red apples are sold at Rs300 and Rs400-500 per kg.
The price of Guava (Larkana, Kasoor and Hyderabad) ranges between Rs200-250 per kg as against Rs150-200 per kg. Good quality Cheeko and Melon are also sold at Rs200-250, up by Rs50 per kg.
After a jump of Rs50-100 per dozen, Kinno’s price ranges from Rs300-500 per dozen, depending on quality and size, while orange (Mosami) is priced at Rs250-300. Fruit vendors said the prices are high because their season is coming to an end.
In meat, live chicken rates have dropped to Rs340-370 per kg from Rs420-460 two weeks back, while retailers have increased veal meat without bones by Rs100 per kg to Rs1,700 from Rs1,600.

The leak was detected in the Phase-I main water line in Block 19 of Gulshan-i-Iqbal. It prompted the utility to initiate urgent repair and maintenance work. The 96-hour operation will begin at 12 noon on Monday.
The Phase-I main pipeline project, particularly the University Road section near Block 19, is part of the high-priority K-4 water augmentation initiative aimed at improving supply reliability.
A KWSC spokesman said the repair work was being carried out to stabilise and strengthen the city’s water supply system ahead of Ramazan. He said the decision was taken to ensure a smooth water supply during the holy month, adding that specialised teams would oversee the process to minimise disruption.

KWSC says leakages in 84-inch main in Gulshan to be plugged in four days

Areas likely to be affected by the water shortage include Landhi, Korangi, Malir, Shah Faisal, Gulshan, Jinnah, Chanesar, Saddar, Lyari and Clifton.
The spokesman said water supply from the Dhabeji Pumping Station would be temporarily reduced, while supply from other pumping stations would remain unaffected. This, he said, would ensure that residents continue to receive a significant portion of their daily water requirements.
He said the city normally receives around 650 million gallons of water per day and, despite the temporary reduction, it would still receive about 450 million gallons daily.
The spokesman said the utility was making efforts to complete the repair work as quickly as possible to minimise inconvenience to residents. He added that the Landhi and Sherpao hydrants would also remain temporarily closed during the repair period.
While the repair work is expected to be completed within 60 hours, the deadline has been extended to 96 hours in case additional repairs are required.
The KWSC advised residents in the affected areas to store water in advance and use it judiciously during the repair period.
Meanwhile, sources in the water utility told Dawn that the 84-inch diameter main line had developed leaks at seven to eight locations. They said a major leak was identified near the KE Power House in Block 19, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, with another leak about 200 feet away. Additional leaks were also found in underground sections of the main line in areas where encroachments had been made above it.
The sources said repair work would be carried out inside the 84-inch diameter main line at the encroached locations.

Sources said one female worker carrying out door-to-door vaccination campaign was attacked by a street dog in Zaman town, Korangi, while the other in the area of Malir Cantonment.
The third incident, the sources said, was reported in the Quaidabad area where a policeman escorting the polio team was bitten by a stray dog. He was later treated at the Indus Hospital.
Speaking to Dawn, a spokesperson for the Sindh Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) only confirmed the cases involving two female workers.

EOC confirms two incidents involving as many female polio workers; cop bitten by stray dog receives treatment at Indus Hospital

“Two incidents involving street dogs affecting polio workers were officially reported today in Korangi and Malir. The safety of our frontline workers is our highest priority, and we stand fully with our teams,” said EOC-Sindh spokesperson Minahil Mustafa.
According to her, the cases were immediately managed as per the health and safety protocols, with full support from relevant departments.
She explained that teams established for the polio vaccination drive at union council level included representatives from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, town municipal corporations and the local government and “such issues are promptly raised and addressed through these coordination mechanisms”.

 

The government encouraged the media and community members to share any relevant information so targeted support and solutions could be provided in affected areas, she added.
Rabies Prevention and Training Centre Manager Aftab Gohar of the Indus Hospital confirmed that a policeman engaged in polio-related duties reported at the hospital with dog-bite injuries on Saturday.
“A 21-year-old policeman, escorting the polio workers, reported at our facility today with dog-bite injuries. His leg injury was classified as a Category II exposure,” he said, adding that he was provided treatment and asked to report back for follow-up doses scheduled on Day 3 and Day 7. This year, he pointed out, at least two to three polio workers with dog-bite injuries had received treatment at the hospital. One of the victims was a woman in her late 30s.
“On a daily basis, however, 150 to 200 dog-bite [old and new] cases are reported at our facility,” he said.
The official emphasised the need for controlling dog population, training healthcare providers in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and creating public awareness.
It might be recalled that this week a rabies case was reported in Karachi, raising the total number of reported cases of the deadly infectious disease to three in the province.
Last year, at least 22 people lost their lives to rabies. Over 41,000 dog-bite cases were reported at three tertiary care hospitals — over 16,000 at the Indus Hospital, over 12,000 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and over 13,000 at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

After hearing arguments from both sides, the court declined to grant access to Mr Khan’s private physicians inside the jail.

 

Appearing for the PTI founder, counsel Faisal Malik argued that as a former prime minister, his client deserved the same medical facilities previously extended to other ex-premiers, citing Nawaz Sharif as precedent. He contended that Mr Khan was an undertrial prisoner and had the legal right to be examined by doctors of his choice. The lawyer also claimed that Adiala jail lacked adequate facilities for specialised eye treatment.

 

Referring to Pakistan Prison Rules, Mr Malik said Rule 795 required that a prisoner’s family be informed before any medical treatment. He questioned why Mr Khan had been taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) late at night, stating that he had not been taken out of jail for three years. Denial of access to personal doctors, he argued, amounted to discriminatory treatment.
Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah opposed the plea, arguing that Mr Khan was on bail in the GHQ attack case related to the May 9 events and convicted in other cases, and therefore could not be treated as an undertrial prisoner whose custody could be regulated by a criminal court. He further maintained that the ATC lacked jurisdiction to issue directions regarding jail administration or medical arrangements. Under prison rules, he said, medical care was the responsibility of government-appointed doctors, with no provision for private physicians.
After hearing both sides, the court dismissed the application.
Separately, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum alleged on X that medical reports promised by the Supreme Court had not been provided to the family, urging the chief justice to take contempt action.







Meanwhile, a Pims medical report confirmed that Mr Khan was diagnosed with right central retinal vein occlusion and received hospital-based treatment, which was completed smoothly. Jail authorities informed the court that Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were receiving medical care strictly under jail rules.

Later, the group visited Imam­bargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra to express solidarity with the victims and the community that faced the terrorist attack during Friday prayers.
Addressing a news conference, Hafiz Ashrafi emphasised the importance of patience and unity in difficult times.

“We, the clerics belonging to all the mainstream schools of thought in the country, are here, and this is neither a political discussion nor a numbers game,” he said, adding that scholars from all sects were visibly emotional upon meeting the victims, refle­cting the gravity of the tragedy.
“The nation stands united and cannot be divided by acts of terrorism. The enemies of the country want to see us divided,” Hafiz Ashrafi said, adding that the ule­ma wanted to convey a single mes­­sage that this was neither a sectarian conflict nor a religious issue.

 

“These are attempts to spread fear and panic among Pakistanis, but the entire nation responded with unity, and citizens came forward to help one another.”
Clerics call for unity
The committee members stres­sed the importance of national harmony and urged all segments of society to work together to promote peace and stability, and not to fall into the trap of those seeking to create divisions along ethnic or religious lines.

 

Allama Hadiul Hussaini, who belongs to Gilgit-Baltistan, said it was the first time such a collective effort had been made, with clerics from all four mainstream sects showing unity by visiting terrorism victims together.
Allama Sajjad Naqvi said Pak­istan came into existence throu­­gh the unity of Muslims of the Sub­continent, adding that anti-state elements were trying to create divisions within the nation thro­­ugh acts of terror. He said terrorists would ultimately fail in their objectives, stressing that Sunni and Shia communities were united.
Those present on the occasion included Allama Zahid Hussain, Allama Mushtaq Naqvi, Maulana Faheem Thanvi, Mufti Mir Ish­ti­­aq, Maulana Zahid Mansoor, Muf­ti Qasim Qasmi, Maulana Zulfiqar Ali, Mufti Hafeez ur Rehman, Maulana Saeed Chishti, Maulana Abu Bakar Sabri, Mufti Hafiz Iqb­al, and Maulana Anis ur Rehman.

Throughout the 1980s, acting at the behest of the United States and Saudi Arabia, the Pakistani state recruited, trained and armed various Islamist Afghan groups to combat Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan.
Once the Soviet forces withdrew in 1989, the victorious proxies failed to reach an amicable power-sharing agreement and began fighting amongst themselves. Desperate to maintain a stake in the region, Pakistan helped mould an even more extreme force, the Taliban, who won decisive battles against rival factions to install a stringent Islamist regime by 1996 in Afghanistan.
While the Pakistani state believed it had successfully installed a government beneficial to its strategic geopolitical interests, the internal fallout of this involvement had already commenced. A decade of establishing recruitment centres where young men were indoctrinated and trained in guerrilla warfare eventually backfired.
These proxy militants turned their guns against the Pakistani state, forming groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to demand the enforcement of Sharia law and the creation of a ‘Greater Afghanistan’ that included Pakistan’s own Pakhtun-majority areas.

From Afghan militancy in the 1980s and 1990s to the Middle East’s sectarian militias and from Africa to Balochistan, modern history is filled with states that created violent proxies, only for them to become existential threats to themselves 

For the next two decades, anti-state groups comprising former proxies and their Pakistani allies unleashed waves of brutal attacks across the country. By the time the state fully grasped the devastating consequences of the strategy it had initiated in the 1980s, over 80,000 Pakistani soldiers, police personnel, politicians and civilians had been killed.
This ongoing conflict underscores a devastating strategic reversal, where proxies, once cultivated as a shield for regional interests, became an existential threat, sustained by the very forces Pakistan helped bring to power.
This is but just one example of how proxies often become a problem for their own creators, a phenomenon frequently described as ‘blowback’. History is littered with instances where short-term tactical gains through third party actors led to long-term domestic catastrophes.
In 2009, the American journalist Andrew Higgins wrote that Israel’s early, indirect encouragement of Islamist elements in the Palestinian territories as a counterweight to Yasser Arafat’s secular Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), contributed to the rise of Hamas, which later became Israel’s most formidable local adversary.
These cases demonstrate a recurring geopolitical truth, that when a state breathes life into a proxy, it loses the ability to control the monster’s appetite once the original mission is over. This loss of control often transforms a strategic asset into a primary security threat, as Iraq experienced following the 2003 US invasion. The initial support provided by regional powers such as Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran to sectarian militias in Iraq eventually resulted in the birth of the Islamic State (ISIS).
In his book ISIS: A History, Lebanese-American academic Fawaz Gerges writes that many of the fighters who formed the backbone of ISIS were seasoned by years of proxy warfare, eventually turning their sights not just on Western targets, but on the regional states that had once turned a blind eye to their radicalisation.
According to British academic Dr Alex Vines, Apartheid-era South Africa funded and trained rebels in Mozambique to destabilise that country. While the rebels successfully crippled Mozambique’s infrastructure, the resulting chaos created a massive refugee crisis and a thriving black market in small arms that flooded back across South African borders, fuelling a rise in violent crime and instability that persisted long after the official conflict ended.
In his book Proxy Warfare, the British political scientist Andrew Mumford writes that the danger of creating proxies lies in the inherent paradox of attempting to outsource national security to autonomous actors, whose interests only temporarily align with those of the sponsor.
According to the American political scientist Tyrone Groh, while states often view these groups as cost-effective tools for projectable power and plausible deniability, they frequently ignore the reality that a proxy is not a precision-guided weapon but a sentient political entity with its own evolving ambitions.



 
As a conflict progresses, the proxy inevitably seeks to shed its dependence on its creator, often utilising the training, funding and ideological fervour it was gifted by its facilitator to pursue an independent and frequently contradictory agenda. This transforms a strategic asset into a domestic liability, a phenomenon that forces the original sponsor to expend even greater resources to contain the radicalism or violence it once actively cultivated.
Despite the overwhelming historical evidence that proxies eventually turn on their creators, the allure of low-cost, deniable warfare remains irresistible to modern states. According to Mumford, this persistence suggests that, for many governments, the immediate tactical advantages — such as bleeding a rival — outweighs the potential for long-term domestic catastrophe.
Contemporary geopolitics has seen the rise of new sponsors who have adopted these risky strategies with varying degrees of success and instability. India has frequently been accused of utilising proxy groups to maintain leverage in its complex regional environment. More recently, scholarship has examined the manner in which India is leveraging Baloch separatist groups in Pakistan to destabilise its western frontier. 
The Baloch separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), as well as the Islamist TTP, have increasingly been identified by Pakistani authorities and some regional analysts as instruments of Indian strategic interest. The discourse surrounding their Indian-proxy status has intensified following significant escalations in 2025 and 2026.
Perhaps more surprisingly, the UAE has emerged as a significant sponsor of third party actors to project power far beyond its small geographic footprint. According to the conflict analyst Emadeddin Badi, during the Libyan civil war, the UAE provided extensive military support, drone strikes, and funding to Gen Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA).
According to the researcher Peter Salisbury, in Yemen, the UAE trained and equipped the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist militia that eventually staged military takeovers of key governorates, often clashing with the interests of the UAE’s own coalition partner, Saudi Arabia. UAE has also faced international scrutiny for its alleged role in fuelling the civil war in Sudan by supplying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) with weapons and logistics, a strategy that has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis and a surge in regional instability.
According to Groh, the continued reliance on this strategy by states confirms a grim geopolitical truth: the “Frankenstein” lesson is often ignored in favour of immediate strategic depth.
Even as nations witness blowback around the world, the temptation to use proxies as a ‘surgical’ tool for regional dominance remains a primary feature of modern statecraft, despite the near-certainty of future complications.

• Says recent reforms must to ‘end judicial overreach’
• Claims military courts hand down ‘lenient sentences’, compared to civil courts
• Legal experts warn against 28th Amendment; question govt’s legitimacy
LAHORE: Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Saturday announced that the government is forming a new high-level committee to investigate the issue of ‘missing persons’ with greater scrutiny, reaffirming the government’s commitment to reaching a target of zero missing person. 
Addressing the 6th Asma Jahangir Conference in Lahore, Mr Tarar admitted that while the reported number of enforced disappearances dropped significantly in recent years from nearly 10,000 to around 2,600, even the current figure was “unacceptable” from a human rights standpoint. 
He detailed an interim relief package designed to support the families of missing persons. This policy mechanism, developed over 18 months, provides not only financial assistance but also legal avenues to address practical complications such as inheritance disputes and the operation of bank accounts held in the names of the missing. 
However, the minister highlighted the complexities involved in tracking these individuals, noting that investigation revealed some persons listed as missing had voluntarily joined banned militant organisations and found dead after police encounters with terrorists. 
26th, 27th Amendments 
Referring to the recent legislation, Mr Tarar used the platform to forcefully defend the 26th and 27th Amendments, labelling them the ‘need of the time’ to correct historical judicial overreach. 
He argued that the changes were designed to curb judicial overreach, noting that for years, the Supreme Court had frequently overstepped its constitutional boundaries, at times rewriting the law and ousting democratically elected prime ministers. 
Mr Tarar acknowledged facing significant public and professional criticism over the amendments, but insisted the establishment of federal constitutional benches was a longstanding democratic demand and the goal was central to the Charter of Democracy. 
The minister expressed concern over the historical trend where a few judges from a single province could dictate the political fate of the country. He explained that the newly restructured Judicial Commission of Pakistan now includes representatives from civil society and minorities, ensuring a broader perspective in the appointment and transfer of judges. 
He questioned whether the residents of smaller provinces, like Sindh and Balochistan, did not have the right to high-quality judicial oversight, defending the commission’s new authority to transfer judges rather than leaving the decision solely to the chief justices of high courts. 
Mr Tarar said civilians could be tried by military courts under national laws if they cross the ‘red line’, including in cases involving attacks on military installations. He explained the Army Act provides with the international guarantees for fair trial, which restrict trials in absentia, ensure access to record and counsel of choice, and the right to appeal in the shape of judicial review.
He said the work on the provision of right to appeal was in process and the parliament would announce a decision soon. He claimed military courts handed down comparatively ‘lenient sentences’, compared to those by ordinary civilian courts operating under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
‘Democracy?’
In contrast to the minister’s opinion, several legal experts at the conference raised concerns over the democratic norms in the country. 
Senior lawyer Akhter Hussain challenged the democratic credentials of the current administration, questioning how a government can be called democratic when its own ministers describe it as a “hybrid regime” or a “partnership” with the military establishment. 
He argued judicial independence and freedom of expression had been severely compromised by the new amendments and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). 
Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, speaking via video link, issued a warning against further changes, stating that a potential 28th Amendment would ‘permanently’ alter the fundamental framework of the 1973 Constitution.  He lamented that bar associations, once independent advocates for constitutional supremacy, were being used by politicians to advance their party agendas.

According to officials, Shah Daulat, 31, a resident of Shimshal, was climbing an ice wall in Khyber village along with a foreign tourist. The two were practising ice climbing, as the mountain develops a steep ice wall during winter.
During the climb on Friday evening, Shah Daulat suddenly slipped on the ice and fell nearly 400 metres, sustaining fatal injuries. He died on the spot.
Local volunteers later recovered his body and shifted it to a government hospital in Sost, near the Pakistan–China border at Khunjerab Pass. On Saturday, his body was dispatched to Shimshal for burial.
Shah Daulat was a young and highly respected climber from Shimshal. He had successfully summited four eight-thousand-meter peaks, including the world’s second-highest peak K2 (8,611m), Nanga Parbat (8,126m), Gasherbrum-II (8,035m), and Gasher­brum-I (8,080m).
In 2025, he also achieved the rare feat of summiting Gasherbrum-I without usi­ng supplementary oxygen, earning recognition as one of the region’s strongest climbers.
Shah Daulat was a relative of renowned Pakistani female mountaineer Samina Baig and was part of her K2 expedition in 2022.
In a post on her official Facebook page, Samina Baig expressed deep grief, saying:
“Shah Daulat was a true gem in our family — a cherished younger brother (cousin) taken from us far too soon. The loss feels heavy, and words fall short. A young mountaineer, he achieved so much in such a short life, touching many hearts with his courage and gentle spirit.
May he rest in peace among the mountains he loved. He will forever remain in our hearts, remembered with love and quiet pride.”
Climbers, politicians, and civil society members expressed deep sorrow over Shah Daulat’s tragic death, paying tribute to his contributions to mountaineering.
Trekker and biker Ammara Sharif said, “I am deeply saddened and at a loss for words over the tragic passing of young mountaineer Shah Daulat. He left this world far too early, but his courage, passion for the mountains, and legacy will live on forever.”
