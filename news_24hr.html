SCIW Superintendent of Police (SP) Syed Saboor Agha told Dawn.com, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”
The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced on X that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — registered by Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.
SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.
“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”
Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.
“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.
According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
One of the main suspects — tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai — was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case. The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.
Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.
In a press release issued by BHC — seen by Dawn.com — it was notified that Justice Barrech “has taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari”. The statement added that, “In this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025”.
The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.
Separately, PPP MNA Shazia Marria moved an adjournment motion in the National Assembly to instead discuss the incident since it was a “matter of urgent national and human importance”.
“This tragic and barbaric act has shaken the conscience of the nation. Such heinous crimes constitute a grave violation of the teachings of Islam, and are in blatant disregard of the Constitution … which guarantees all citizens the right to life, dignity, due process, and equal protection under the law. Furthermore, such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life.
“This House must condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms. I urge the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government of Balochistan, obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested, and prosecuted without delay.”
Marri also said it was “imperative” that the state be made the complainant in the FIR and subsequent legal proceedings to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, reinforce public confidence in the justice system and avoid any compromise or pressure on the victims’ families.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
CM vows justice to be ensured
Addressing a press conference to discuss the details of the case, CM Bugti said he stood with the victims and vowed that justice would be served regardless of tribal affiliation.
He said he immediately ordered the arrest of suspects within 24 hours of the video going viral, adding 12 people had been detained so far, including a tribal chief.
Bugti clarified misinformation circulating on social and mainstream media, rejecting claims that the victims were a newly married couple. “The woman and man weren’t married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,” he said, adding that these details did not justify the killing.
“It is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,” he said.
 


He added that the Special Branch deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posted in Dagari were suspended for failing to report the incident to the government.
The chief minister also pointed out the spread of misinformation through social media and the lack of investigative journalism.
“People sitting in Karachi and Lahore don’t know what Dagari is. But still, did anyone do any investigation? No. It was the murderer himself who released the video.”
Bugti said that he had received a call from PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and that operations were underway upon his instructions. He said the government would follow constitutional channels, not tribal jirgas, to resolve the case.
Condemnations
Bilawal called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a post on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”
He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also condemned the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.
“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.
“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”
The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.
Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.
“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.
“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”
She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.

“The Pakistan Sports Board has declared age fraud a violation under the Pakistan Code of Ethics and Governance in Sports and any such act is liable to sanctions,” read  a notification issued by the PSB, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Globally, age fraud in sports, especially in junior categories, poses a serious threat to fair competition, athlete safety, and the integrity of sporting structures,” the notification added.
The PSB said that youth sports worldwide are classified on the basis of chronological age to ensure equal opportunity and fair play, adding, “It is suspected that athletes are participating in age-restricted competitions with falsified or inaccurate age documentation.”
The PSB continued that all athletes under the age of 21 participating in junior events must now submit either a national identity card (CNIC) or a B-Form, along with names of the selection committee members, dental examinations, and radiological tests.
In addition, medical reports verified by the president and secretary general of the respective sports federation, along with all supporting documents, must be submitted to the PSB for verification.
The notification stated that any athlete found submitting fake or suspicious documents will be declared ineligible for participation in training camps, financial assistance, or cash awards. Further disciplinary action might also be taken.
The notification pointed out that some athletes allegedly participate in age-specific categories using forged documents, depriving genuine athletes of opportunities and increasing the risk of injuries due to physical mismatches.
The PSB further noted that the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and other global sports bodies have repeatedly stressed the need for transparency and integrity in sports, calling for a zero-tolerance approach to age falsification.
“Only athletes who submit verified and accurate documentation will now be eligible to participate in PSB training camps and receive financial support or cash awards,” the notification concluded.
Earlier this month, the PSB took serious notice of officials in various sports federations holding positions beyond the permissible two terms, in violation of the National Sports Policy 2005.
The PSB issued warning letters to nine office-bearers from different federations who have exceeded the allowed tenure limits, according to a press release issued by the Board.
In May, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was postponed from its initial dates in May.
The games were set to be held from May 1-9 in Karachi but were postponed in April due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to an official letter issued by the Sindh Olympics Association.</p><small>2025-07-21 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21162932330c05e.png?r=163020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645/at-least-19-killed-as-bangladesh-air-force-plane-crashes-into-college-campus' target='_blank'><strong>At least 19 killed as Bangladesh air force plane crashes into college campus</strong></a><br><p>At least 19 people were killed as a Bangladesh air force training aircraft crashed into a college and school campus in the capital city of Dhaka on Monday, a fire services official said.
More than 50 people, including children and adults, were hospitalised with burns, a doctor at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery told reporters.
The incident occurred at the Milestone School and College in Dhaka’s northern area of Uttara, officials said.
“Bangladesh Air Force’s F-7 BGI training aircraft crashed in Uttara. The aircraft took off at 13:06 (12:06pm PKT),” the military’s public relations department said in a statement.
Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance.
Firefighters sprayed water on the mangled remains of the plane, which appeared to have rammed into the side of a building, damaging iron grills and creating a gaping hole in the structure, Reuters TV visuals showed.
“A third-grade student was brought in dead, and three others, aged 12, 14 and 40, were admitted to the hospital,” said Bidhan Sarker, head of the burn unit at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where some victims were taken.
According to the Daily Star, an emergency hotline (01949-043697) had been launched at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery following the crash.
Visuals also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.
“When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realised something came from behind […] I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke,” said Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school.
The Daily Star further reported that three platoons of the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) were deployed to Uttara to assist in law enforcement and rescue operations, according to the BGB headquarters.
It added that the government has declared a one-day state mourning day tomorrow following the crash. The national flag will be flown at half-mast at all government, semi-government, autonomous institutions and educational establishments, as well as at Bangladeshi missions abroad.
“Special prayers will be held in all religious places of worship throughout the country for the injured and deceased,” it said.
Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said that “necessary measures” would be taken to investigate the cause of the accident and “ensure all kinds of assistance”.
“The loss suffered by the Air Force […] students, parents, teachers and staff, and others in this accident is irreparable,” he said.
The incident comes a little over a month after an Air India plane crashed on top of a medical college hostel in India’s Ahmedabad, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.

Police spokesperson, Adnan Haider, told Dawn.com, “A man — along with his son — shot his brother-in-law over a monetary dispute in Mayar Bazaar.”
Haider said that during the shooting, two children who were passing by were also injured.  “The children were identified as residents of Shekhanu Kaly, Lower Dir,” he said.
A press release by the district police said that the two suspects had been taken into custody, and a case had been registered against them for further investigation.
“An investigation is underway so that all aspects of the incident can be fully exposed.”
Haider said that the injured were moved to the Mayar Hospital for medical assistance and a first information report (FIR) was registered at the police station.
“The Lower Dir DPO (district police officer) appreciated the timely and successful action of the police team and made it clear that the Lower Dir police is always on alert to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the citizens,” the press release added.
Domestic disputes are common in Pakistan, often triggered by financial issues, inheritance, or family interference. In some cases, these escalate due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms, weak legal enforcement, and deeply rooted patriarchal norms.
Earlier this month, four members of a woman’s family were shot dead in the Tatara area of KP’s Nowshera district, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, according to police.
Also this month, a man allegedly killed his son and daughter-in-law following an argument in the Tangi area of Charsadda district.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21094310f771e53.jpg?r=094321' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925571/akhtar-mengal-barred-from-travelling-abroad-offloaded-from-plane' target='_blank'><strong>Akhtar Mengal barred from travelling abroad, offloaded from plane</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal was barred from travelling abroad and offloaded on Sunday from a Dubai-bound plane at Quetta airport.
Immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rmed Mr Mengal that his name has been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad.
After the incident, Mr Mengal issued a statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), saying he has been stopped from travelling abroad without prior notice or any explanation.
“Today I was stopped at Quetta Airport from flying to Dubai. Airport officials informed me that my name is on the PNIL. This decision was made without my knowledge and without any clear reason,” Mr Mengal wrote on X.
 






A BNP spokesperson condemned the move, calling it another example of political victimisation and an attack on democratic values.
The spokesman demanded that Mr Mengal’s name be immediately removed from the list and those responsible for the decision be held accountable.
No official reason has been given by the government so far for placing Mr Mengal’s name on PNIL.
BNP’s central information secretary, Agha Hassan Baloch, also condemned the travel restriction placed on the BNP president and termed the government move unconstitutional and politically motivated.
 
 

He said the action of the government was a clear violation of Mr Mengal’s constitutional right to freedom of movement and an attempt to suppress fundamental human rights.
“We demand an immediate explanation from authorities concerned. Such repressive tactics are unacceptable in a democratic setup. Political dissent and public representation must not be criminalised,” Mr Hassan said.
Sana Baloch, another BNP leader, said: “We demand a prompt explanation from authorities concerned and immediate removal of Sardar Akhtar Mengal’s name from the PNIL. These authoritarian measures are unacceptable. Targeting political opposition and elected representatives is incompatible with constitutional democracy.”

The 2015 deal, reached between Iran and the UN Security Council’s permanent members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — plus Germany imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
But it unravelled when the United States in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as president, unilaterally withdrew from the accord and reimposed sweeping sanctions.
The Europeans had pledged continued support for the deal, but the mechanism intended to offset US sanctions never materialised effectively, and many Western firms were forced to exit Iran, which has since faced a deepening economic crisis.
“The European parties have been at fault and negligent in implementing” the nuclear agreement, said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei.
The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country currently enriching uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 accord.
That is a short step from the 90pc required for a nuclear weapon.
In recent weeks, France, Britain, and Germany have threatened to trigger the UN snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, accusing Iran of breaching its nuclear commitments.
Using this clause “is meaningless, unjustifiable and immoral”, Baqaei told a news conference, arguing that Iran only began distancing itself from the agreement in response to Western non-compliance.
“Iran’s reduction of its commitments was carried out in accordance with the provisions outlined in the agreement,” the foreign ministry spokesman added.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21123139d547928.png?r=134052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622/fm-dar-in-new-york-to-attend-high-level-unsc-events-including-conference-on-palestine-fo' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar in New York to attend high-level UNSC events, including conference on Palestine: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine, according to the Foreign Office.
Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”
 






It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
According to a July 19 statement issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.
Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211314098c87a06.jpg?r=131452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925627/evidence-shows-jeju-air-pilots-shut-off-less-damaged-engine-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence shows Jeju Air pilots shut off less-damaged engine before crash, source says</strong></a><br><p>The South Korea-led investigation into Jeju Air’s fatal plane crash in December has “clear evidence” that pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after a bird strike, a source with knowledge of the probe said on Monday.
The source said the evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, computer data and a physical engine switch found in the wreckage showed pilots shut off the left engine instead of the right engine when taking emergency steps after a bird strike just before it was scheduled to land.
“The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,” the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because investigators have not released an official report including this evidence.
A government source said examinations of the plane’s recovered engines found that no defects had been present before the bird strike and crash.
The December 29 crash of the Boeing 737-800 jet at Muan Airport killed all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board and was the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.
Investigators told victims’ family members at a briefing on Saturday that the right engine had been more severely damaged by a bird strike than the left, and there was circumstantial evidence that pilots had turned off the less-damaged left engine, according to a third source who was at the briefing.
South Korean media outlets including MBN and Yonhap reported that information on Saturday and Sunday.
South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), which is leading the investigation, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Boeing referred questions about the crash to ARAIB. Engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between GE GE.N and France’s Safran, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jeju Air said it was actively cooperating with the ARAIB’s investigation and awaiting the official announcement of the results.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
A preliminary report released in January said duck remains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane after the flight from Bangkok crashed at Muan Airport, but did not give details about the extent of remains or damage found in each engine.
Objections from victims’ families
South Korea’s investigation body on Saturday cancelled a planned release to media of an update on what is known so far about the engines.
Families of the crash victims were briefed on the report ahead of its planned release, but objected to its publication, saying that it appeared to apportion blame to the pilots without exploring other contributing factors, lawyers representing the families said.
The Jeju Air flight overshot Muan Airport’s runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment, leading to a fire and partial explosion.
Representatives of victims’ families and the Jeju Air pilots’ union said over the weekend that the investigation needs to also focus on the embankment, which aviation experts have said likely contributed to the high death toll.
 
 

The Jeju Air pilots’ union said the ARAIB was “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine given traces of bird remains were found in both engines.
The union accused the ARAIB of trying to make pilots “scapegoats” by failing to provide scientific and technological grounds that the plane could have landed safely with only the left engine turned on.
Air accidents are complex incidents that occur due to a number of contributing factors, and investigators have not produced evidence so far to support the implication that the accident was a result of pilot error, the union said.
Investigators are so far “silent about organisational responsibility”, the union said.
A body representing bereaved families said in a statement there were some phrases related to the cause of the accident in the planned press release that could be interpreted as if a final conclusion had been reached, and all facts surrounding the incident must be clarified.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615050-us-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties' target='_blank'><strong>US renewed interest in Pakistan has India recalibrating China ties</strong></a><br><p>

Most were forced into exile when the Taliban regained power in 2021 and then effectively outlawed women from playing sport.
Many fled to Australia and held a match — without their official crest — in Melbourne earlier this year.
The ICC’s annual conference in Singapore at the weekend heard that progress had been made on the governing body’s Afghanistan women’s cricket initiative.
“The programme aims to deliver structured support,” the ICC said in a statement late Sunday.

Erwin Labitad Segovia, 63, a broadcaster for Radio WOW FM and host of a programme that focused on social issues and local governance, was shot dead by a still-unidentified gunman while on his way home shortly after completing his morning broadcast.
According to the police, Segovia was followed by two suspects on a motorcycle.
The Philippines ranked ninth on the 2024 Committee to Protect Journalists’ Global Impunity Index, which tracks countries where journalist murders remain unsolved.
Authorities have launched an investigation and have activated a special investigation task group to handle the case, Jose Torres Jr, executive director of the presidential task force on media security, said in a statement.
“The safety of journalists remains a priority for the government, and justice for victims of media-related violence continues to be a national concern,” Torres said.
Segovia’s murder highlights the continuing risks faced by journalists in the Philippines, especially in provinces where local power dynamics often go unchecked.
More than 200 journalists have been killed in the country since democracy was restored in 1986, according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, including 32 in a single incident in 2009 in the south of the country.</p><small>2025-07-21 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615023-ihc-issues-contempt-notice-to-federal-cabinet-in-dr-aafia-siddiqui-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues contempt notice to PM, federal cabinet members in Dr Aafia Siddiqui case</strong></a><br><p>

It is also one of the few types of pollution that equally impacts land, air, and water.
The primary contributor is single-use plastic products, with plastic shopping bags being the most significant. In countries like ours, the low cost and the lack of equally convenient safe alternatives are the two main reasons for their ever-increasing use. Plastic particles suspended in the air are a major cause of air pollution and contribute to smog during the winter season. Additionally, the dumping of plastic bags into water bodies, which eventually flow into the sea, significantly harms marine life.
 
 

The world became aware of the disastrous environmental impacts of plastic pollution in the late 1980s, and many developing countries, including Pakistan, began efforts to control it in the late 1990s. However, they still continue to struggle to eliminate it from the market.
Before the 18th Amendment, the federal government attempted to ban single-use plastic bags by restricting their manufacturing based on thickness and size. These bans produced temporary results, but the long-standing habit of using cheap, disposable plastic bags soon resurfaced. After the 18th Amendment, each province has been grappling with efforts to ban this menace, but unfortunately, these efforts have largely been unsuccessful, often remaining confined to paper; the government has often been criticised for creating policies on paper that lack effective implementation in practice.

If the supply of plastic bags is banned, demand will naturally shift to the eco-friendly alternatives permitted to meet consumer needs

The efforts to ban plastic bags in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, have faced significant challenges despite government initiatives. While the government has repeatedly attempted to enforce bans, various obstacles have consistently hindered progress. For instance, the Sindh government has been striving to ban plastic bags since 1998 but has largely faced setbacks due to peculiar reasons.
In the late 1990s, black plastic bags were banned in Sindh because of their cancer-causing substances. However, resistance from the hardware retail sector led to their continued availability in the undocumented black market, where plastic manufacturing operates unregulated.
In 2004, Sindh ambitiously imposed a ban on plastic bags thinner than 30 microns. Unfortunately, plastic bag manufacturers successfully opposed it, citing the potential loss of 60,000 jobs in the sector. Weak enforcement and a lack of consumer cooperation, driven by insufficient awareness of the environmental and health hazards of plastic bags, were the two primary reasons for the ban’s failure, and both issues were closely tied to the widespread availability of plastic bags in the market.
That said, theoretically, if plastic bags were entirely removed from circulation, consumers would likely adapt quickly, reverting to practices from the early 1980s when cloth bags and straw baskets were commonly used.
The recent ban on all types of plastic bags in Sindh is encountering familiar challenges, with the government striving to engage all stakeholders to ensure success this time. However, within just a week of the ban’s enforcement, resistance from the supply side surfaced, prompting regulators to seek a balanced solution that supports the ban while addressing the business interests of affected sectors. This approach aims to find common ground, fostering cooperation to achieve positive outcomes for all parties involved.
If the supply chain for plastic bags is completely eliminated, manufacturers would need to adapt to the non-availability of raw materials or face heavy taxes designed to reduce their profit margins. These manufacturers are key players, and as long as they resist a complete ban, efforts to eradicate plastic bags will continue indefinitely.
A straightforward solution would be to prohibit the production of plastic bags, compelling manufacturers to shift to eco-friendly alternatives. They often claim concern over the higher costs of these alternatives, arguing that they are unaffordable for the lower-middle-income group and poor consumers. In reality, their primary worry is the reduced profit margins, as it is well-established that eco-friendly alternatives do not offer the same high profitability as plastic bags.
Initially, eco-friendly products may have a higher per-unit cost due to lower production volumes. However, as demand grows and production scales, prices could decrease to more reasonable levels. This price reduction depends on the willingness of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to accept lower profit margins. Embracing these alternatives requires a collective commitment to sustainability over short-term financial gains.
Numerous research studies, both local and global, confirm that the primary resistance to plastic bag bans comes from the supply side, which has the resources to oppose such measures through various means. This is particularly evident in Pakistan, where plastic manufacturers frequently challenge bans in court when imposed by authorised entities.
In developing African countries, the failure to enforce plastic bag bans is largely attributed to plastic manufacturers, who are deeply entrenched in political and administrative systems. In Pakistan, the documented plastic bag manufacturing sector accounts for only 30 per cent of the market share, while the remaining 70pc is untraceable, potentially consisting of black-market operations, undocumented production, or illegal activities by documented manufacturers.
However, there is no verified data available to confirm the market share distribution of the plastic bag industry in Pakistan. This lack of reliable information creates ambiguity regarding who is manufacturing what within the country’s plastic industry.
If John Maynard Keynes were alive today, even he might struggle to determine who bears greater responsibility for the failure to ban plastic bags in Pakistan.
Supply-side economics faces pressures that discourage a shift to eco-friendly alternatives, often citing higher costs but primarily driven by lower profit margins. On the demand side, consumers, though not fully aware of the harms of plastic bags, have little choice but to use the convenient options available in the market.
If plastic bags are cheap, consumers will buy them readily; if they are expensive, consumers will use them more cautiously and for longer periods. It is misguided to blame the demand-side economy under the pretext that supply will persist as long as demand exists. Instead, the perspective should be reversed: if the supply of plastic bags is banned, demand will naturally shift to the eco-friendly alternatives permitted to meet consumer needs.

The sentence on the page seems simple enough: “Yeh Bano aur Mani kay nana hain.” He takes a breath and tries:
“Yeh Banoo aur Mani…”
The teacher gently corrects him. “Yeh Bano aur Mani…”
He pauses, puzzled. Why did the Urdu letter wow in Bano sound like “o” in go? He gathers his confidence and moves to the next line:
“Nana bazaar say aro laye hain.”
This time, he applies the same rule, reading aroo as aro, just like Bano. The teacher shakes her head. “It’s aroo.”
Confusion deepens in his eyes. Why did the same letter wow sound like an “o” in Bano but an “oo” (as in moon) in aroo? His teacher hesitates, offering a response that countless Urdu learners have heard before:
“That’s just how it is.”
The invisible barrier in Urdu literacy
This scene unfolds in classrooms across Pakistan every day. The struggle isn’t about intelligence or effort — it’s about a missing piece in how the Urdu language is taught. The confusion faced by children, like the one in the anecdote above, often arises from the lack of explicit and systematic phonics instruction.
Two distinct vowel sounds — for example, the “o” in go and the “oo” in moon — may remain indistinguishable to a young learner without the right approach to reading instruction. From a research lens, this aligns with findings from the Science of Reading, a body of research that emphasises the importance of phonemic awareness — the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the individual sounds (phonemes) within spoken words — and phonics as foundational for reading skills. Just as evidence-based methods are now informing and transforming early literacy in English, so too should they guide Urdu reading instruction.
While the core factors influencing reading skill development are generally similar across alphabetic languages, their impact can vary significantly depending on how closely the letters in a language correspond to their sounds. In languages with transparent orthographies (the rules and conventions of how a language is written, including spelling, punctuation, capitalisation, and the use of symbols), like Finnish or Spanish, the connection is direct and predictable.
 
 

Urdu, by contrast, presents a deeper orthographic challenge: letters and sounds do not consistently align, making decoding more cognitively demanding for early readers. Leading reading researchers such as Linnea Ehri or David Kilpatrick have noted that deep orthographies place an added burden on working memory and phonological processing, requiring instruction that goes beyond rote memory or guessing strategies.
Yet, Urdu instruction continues to overlook the foundational principles that make reading more accessible in complex writing systems.
What makes Urdu harder to read than it should be
Urdu is a complex and rich language, with 44 consonants, eight long oral vowels, seven long nasal vowels, three short vowels, and numerous diphthongs. While consonant sounds are usually taught through consistent sound-symbol cues and familiar examples — a practice that supports phonetic decoding — vowels are often left by the wayside, with far less systematic instruction.
In most Urdu curricula and published textbooks, only three long vowel sounds — like the “aa” in baat, the “o” in dost, and the “ee” in cheez — are introduced in the early stages. Few teaching materials or classroom practices introduce the remaining 15 or so vowel sounds later, and by that time, many students have already adapted to reading Urdu through contextual guessing rather than phonetic decoding — a practice that weakens their long-term literacy skills.
This makes the need for explicit phonics instruction in Urdu even more critical, particularly in teaching diacritic (a sign indicating a difference in pronunciation) vowel sounds. Urdu’s script includes diacritics, known as zabar ( َ), zer ( ِ), and pesh ( ُ), to represent short vowels. However, in most printed texts and early reading materials, these vowel markers are often omitted. Without systematic instruction in recognising and applying diacritics, children are left to guess at the correct pronunciation.
According to Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), over 55 per cent of Grade 5 students in rural areas cannot read a Grade 2 level Urdu text in Pakistan. Furthermore, over 40pc of Grade 3 students cannot even identify individual letters. These figures point towards a systemic issue in the teaching of language which is rooted not in student ability but rather in instructional design.
 
 

Taking the earlier anecdote into consideration, the letter “و” in Urdu can represent multiple vowel and consonant sounds. In the word Bano (بانو), it sounds like the “o” in go. In aroo (آرو), it shifts to the “oo” in too. Yet when it appears at the beginning of a word like vehshat (وحشت), it takes on the consonant sound — the “w” in wall.
For young readers trying to apply letter-sound patterns, these inconsistencies can be frustratingly difficult to navigate. This example is just one among many. Without a strong phonics foundation, students are left to guess at and memorise words, hindering their confidence and fluency. A structured approach to phonics, tailored to Urdu’s unique characteristics, can empower children to decode with greater ease and understanding.
Comparison with Arabic and why Urdu needs its own approach
Interestingly, Arabic was originally written without diacritics to continue the oral traditions of interpreting words through context. However, as Islam spread across the Arabian Peninsula and the need for preserving the exact pronunciation of the Quran surfaced, the diacritics were brought into religious and formal texts.
Since Urdu did not have the same religious impetus, it continued omitting the diacritics for most general texts. Some educators argue that omitting diacritics encourages contextual reading or reflects natural adult reading habits. This assumption fails to account for the cognitive demands placed on early readers who lack sufficient phonemic mastery to rely on context. For beginning readers, especially in early years or in multilingual environments, these omissions become cognitive roadblocks rather than bridges.
Arabic, having a morphological structure strongly based in root words, can afford to skip diacritics and still allow readers to use morphology to guess the correct pronunciation. Arabic readers can often infer meaning from familiar roots even without vowels, but Urdu readers do not have this advantage, as noted by linguistic experts.
Urdu’s reliance on phonetic differences for meaning means that even small vowel changes can drastically alter a word’s interpretation. The word ملی (mili — met) vs ملی (milli — national) are hard to differentiate without the diacritic tashdeed which signals gemination of the consonant ‘l’ to create meaning. Phonics instruction that highlights these differences is essential for building accuracy and comprehension.
Beyond the absence of diacritic instruction, Urdu readers face additional challenges that compound reading difficulties. These challenges are rooted in the script itself, its positional letter forms, and the limitations of digital text rendering. Unlike Latin scripts, many Urdu letters change their shapes depending on their position within a word (beginning, middle, or end).
For example, ب (be), ت (te), and ث (se) have similar forms that can confuse young readers. Without systematic exposure to these variations, children struggle to recognise words accurately. Additionally, Urdu’s traditional Nastaliq script is ornate and highly cursive. Script analysis points out that while this adds to its aesthetic appeal, it complicates decoding for young readers. Letters flow into one another, creating intricate, variable shapes. The lack of standardised digital fonts further exacerbates this challenge, with broken or incomplete text making learning even harder.
 
 

It is widely recognised that many digital platforms offer poor Urdu text rendering. Unlike Arabic and Persian, which benefit from extensive digital font support, Urdu often faces incomplete ligatures and missing diacritics, making reading on screens even more difficult. Addressing these challenges through thoughtful script design, technological improvements, and classroom adaptations can complement phonics instruction. A comprehensive approach to Urdu literacy would ensure that young readers have the support they need to develop confidence and proficiency.
A way forward — teaching for transparency
Although the problems are many, some solutions are still within reach. A slight shift in teaching practices, and a more supportive educational ecosystem can add much to the teaching of Urdu as a language. Textbook revisions, child-friendly fonts, and engaging children’s literature for all age groups are essential.
Most urgent is the need to embed phonics and diacritic-based reading strategies into teacher preparation programs and national curricula. Pre-service and in-service teacher training modules must include structured literacy approaches tailored to Urdu’s orthography. Without teacher capacity, reforms at the textbook level may not translate into classroom practice.
Urdu’s classification as a deep orthography is primarily due to its frequent use of ‘unvowelised’ text. However, preliminary research in this area suggests that when vowel sounds are systematically taught through phonics, Urdu’s reading challenges can be significantly reduced. By using diacritics consistently during early instruction, Urdu effectively becomes a shallow orthography — one where the connection between letters and sounds is more transparent.
This shift makes Urdu more accessible not only for young learners but also for individuals with dyslexia, non-native speakers, and those learning Urdu as a second language. Just as phonics has proven effective in teaching English and other alphabetic languages, the systematic teaching of diacritics can bridge the gap in Urdu literacy.
It is 2pm again, but this time, the boy is eagerly flipping through his favourite Urdu storybook. The same unfamiliar curves that once puzzled him now feel like old friends. With each sentence he reads, his confidence grows — because this time, he knows why ‘بانو’ sounds like Bano and ‘آرو’ like aroo. This transformation is what a robust phonics-based Urdu instruction can achieve.
Every child deserves that moment of joy in reading, and with thoughtful reforms in Urdu instruction, countless others will experience it too. For this to happen, collaboration is needed across textbook boards, teacher training institutes, software developers, and education ministries. A national phonics framework for Urdu — especially one that incorporates diacritics — can serve as a powerful equaliser in literacy instruction, particularly for underserved and multilingual learners.</p><small>2025-07-21 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2111452486d9469.jpg?r=114743' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925566/balancing-recovery-and-price-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Balancing recovery and price stability</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s economy is at a critical crossroads. In mid-July 2025, the government raised retail fuel prices sharply — petrol by Rs5.36 and diesel by Rs11.37 per litre — adding to already-rising inflationary pressures.
Petrol and diesel fuel most transportation and food-supply chains, and higher fuel costs quickly cascade into broader price rises. In sum, the recent fuel price shock is a classic cost-push inflation hit to Pakistani households.
These hikes come amid volatile global oil markets due to Middle Eastern conflicts and a weak rupee, compounding the inflation impact. Notably, Pakistan applies heavy taxes on fuel: almost Rs98 per litre is collected in levies. These petroleum levies raised Rs1.16 trillion in FY24, with a budget target of Rs1.47tr in FY25. In short, fuel is both a driver of inflation and a major fiscal revenue source.
As of late, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been easing policy aggressively to support growth but now likely faces a trade-off between stimulating activity and curbing inflation. Since mid-2024 the SBP slashed its key rate from 22 per cent to just 11pc.

Monetary easing and liquidity expansion have likely supported growth indicators, but they may create a risk of renewed inflation if not reined in

This rapid easing helped revive credit and investment, but it also increased the money supply. In early 2025, with headline inflation at historic lows (around 0.3pc in April 2025), the SBP even paused its cuts in March 2025, citing emerging price risks. By mid-June 2025 the SBP held the rate at 11pc, noting that global oil and commodity volatility and Middle East tensions posed upside risks to inflation.
After a period of low inflation, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) near 0–3pc in early 2025, forecasts expected inflation to drift up. The May 2025 CPI was 3.5pc year-on-year, still low by Pakistan’s standards, but it seems that factors like rising energy prices and currency pass-through could push it higher later in the year.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee projected inflation returning to the 5–7pc target range by the end of FY26, but noted significant uncertainty. Recent SBP statements emphasise caution. The June 2025 hold was justified by risks of volatile inflation from ongoing conflicts and commodity swings.
Even if headline inflation is low now, persistent core and food inflation pressures call for a prudent stance. The SBP is likely to pause further rate cuts and may even reverse some easing if inflation heads up. Any visible jump in CPI numbers in the coming months — for example, due to these fuel hikes — will sharply limit the SBP’s room to manoeuvre, especially under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) conditionalities.
On the external front, record remittances have bolstered Pakistan’s foreign earnings, but the rupee has nonetheless weakened. Worker remittances hit an all-time high of $38.3 billion in FY25, up 26.6pc from $30.3bn in FY24. These inflows — driven largely by earnings from the Gulf, the UK, and the US — helped nearly balance the trade deficit and kept the current account modestly positive.
However, the Pakistani rupee is still sliding. In early July 2025 the interbank rate was around Rs284–285 to a dollar and about Rs287–288 in the open market, meaning the rupee trades above 280 per dollar much of the time. This depreciation partly reflects deliberate SBP policy.
According to the SBP, it bought over $8bn from the domestic market in FY25, intervening mainly in late FY25, supported by the remittance surge. This built gross reserves to roughly $14.5bn by the end of June 2025, from lows of around $11–12bn earlier; a 39-month high. Traders note the SBP also tightened dollar supply by limiting importers’ foreign exchange access, especially in Q4FY25.
All else equal, draining dollars and boosting reserves tend to weaken the rupee, because imports must now compete for fewer available foreign exchange resources. A weaker rupee immediately raises the rupee cost of dollar-priced imports. Analysts emphasise that this cost-push effect is already feeding inflation: a rupee slide from around Rs230–280 per dollar over two years has dramatically raised landed costs for fuel, medicines, industrial inputs, and food. Fuel is particularly sensitive, as Pakistan imports around 80pc of its oil.
A rise in the dollar rate translates very quickly into higher fuel prices at the pump, which then cascades into higher transport and food costs. In sum, the cumulative effect of currency depreciation is imported inflation. By June 2025, food inflation was already partly due to such pass-through.
Despite heavy imports, strong remittances roughly kept the current account nearly balanced in FY25. The SBP even achieved a small surplus through April 2025, aided by a $1bn IMF disbursement that lifted reserves. But the outlook is fragile: with domestic demand rising in FY26, imports may jump, and the current account could slip into deficit, exerting further pressure on the rupee.
In parallel with currency manoeuvres, the SBP has been injecting massive liquidity into the banking system. Three large Open Market Operations (OMOs) in June–July 2025 stand out. These injections responded to seasonal and structural liquidity demands, such as Eid-related cash needs and lags in external inflows.
However, such large injections flood the economy with rupees at a time when demand is already recovering. This massive rupee circulation from these OMOs only deepens inflationary pressures.
In practical terms, more liquidity combined with lower rates can fuel consumer spending and credit even as supply constraints due to fuel costs and low crop yields persist. With the policy rate at only 11pc, further injections risk stoking demand-side inflation.
In summary, monetary easing and liquidity expansion have likely supported growth indicators, but they may create a risk of renewed inflation if not reined in soon. Pakistan’s policymakers are balancing conflicting objectives. On one hand, supporting growth and shoring up reserves is vital. On the other hand, domestic price stability is under threat from the factors above.
A more coordinated and synced fiscal-monetary stance would help. On the monetary side, the SBP may need to pause any further rate cuts or even raise rates and withdraw liquidity if inflation accelerates. Tightening OMOs by selling government paper could soak up excess rupees. Such moves would signal inflation-fighting intent and help anchor expectations.
On the fiscal side, the government could moderate fiscal policy to avoid adding fuel to the fire. In practice, this could mean holding fuel taxes steady or reducing them temporarily to cushion households. For instance, when world oil prices fell in March 2025, the government froze fuel prices and used the savings to promise lower electricity tariffs. Continuing such relief measures, or at least not raising petroleum levies further, would relieve some inflationary pressure.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s economy stands at an inflationary crossroads. Rising fuel prices and a weakening rupee are putting new upward pressure on prices, just as policymakers have been loosening money and credit. Going forward, restoring credibility will require firm signals on inflation control — even as growth is nurtured. Transparent coordination, including possibly phasing in inflationary costs rather than abrupt hikes and judicious use of fiscal buffers, will be essential to navigate these challenges and stabilise both the economy and public confidence.n

According to meteorological office, 18.6mm and 21.8mm of rainfall was recorded at its airport and city observatories, respectively.
The busy areas like Cloth Market, Fatima Jinnah Road, Makki Shah, Railway Station, low-lying lanes of Qasimabad, Wahdat Colony, Hussainabad and Latifabad were inundated. Most areas within the Hyderabad city were hit by drainage issue because of choked storm water drains that have not been de-silted for long. As many as 55 feeders of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) tripped amid the rain on Sunday, a spokesman for the utility said. These feeders were gradually re-energised, he added.

Two women, teenage boy electrocuted; seven-year-old drowns in pond

Most parts of Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts received several heavy and light spells of rain on Saturday night and Sunday.
Officials at the local Met office told Dawn that Larkana received 93.5mm and Mohenjo Daro 86mm of rain.
Two women, Razia Mugheri, 40, a resident of Yar Mohammed Colony, and Kaveeta Chachar, 22, a resident of Islam Chachar village, were electrocuted during rainfall.
They received fatal electrical shock while trying to switch on the water motor at their respective homes.
Sukkur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, and Khairpur districts of upper Sindh also received several spells of moderate rain that had started on late Saturday and continued till Sunday evening.
A 13-year-old boy, Imdad Ali Sarki, was electrocuted when he touched an electricity pole outside his home in the Garhi Sabayo area of Jacobabad. The area falls within the limits of the Saddar police station.
His family members rushed him to the Jacobabad Civil Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Two young brothers, Rashid Ali and Abu Bakar, belonging to the Khoso tribe, drowned while bathing in a canal along Khuda Bakhsh Noorani village in Thull taluka of Jacobabad district.
A hectic search was mounted by their family after they went missing. Finally, their bodies were seen floating in the canal.
Separately, a seven-year-old boy, Misbah, drowned in a pond of rainwater while playing outside his home in the city.
Strong winds sweeping the entire upper Sindh region before and during the rainfall caused hours-long power outages and badly disrupted telecommunication network across the region.
The rains also caused flooding in urban and rural areas creating deep ponds of rainwater and sewage blocking people’s access to their homes as well as vital installations such as railway stations, bust stands, hospitals and workplaces. Drainage system in all cities and towns turned dysfunctional.
The roof of a vegetable shop owned by the Khairpur municipality and allotted to a tenant collapsed during the rainfall. No one was injured in the incident.
Jacobabad received a brief spell of downpour at about 3pm on Sunday.
Mirpurkhas district and its outskirts received intermittent showers leading to inundation of highway, main roads, streets and low-lying areas on Sunday.
Rainwater remained accumulated as the municipality failed to make any arrangement for draining it out.
In some low-lying areas, knee-deep water mixed with sewage was witnessed. The areas worst-hit by flooding and foul smell included Lalchandabad, Toorabad, Dholanabad, M.A. Jinnah Road, Station Road, Hameed Pura Colony, Hirabad, Nai Para, Bhansinghabad, Ismail Shah graveyard and colony, Panhwer Colony, Rajar Colony and Pak Colony.
Most areas of Mirpurkhas district also experienced prolonged power outages during the rainfall.

Passengers jumped overboard with lifejackets after the fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado, according to the Indonesian coast guard.
A video released by the Manado rescue agency showed a coast guard vessel spraying water on the ferry, which was emitting black smoke.
Indonesian authorities previously reported five people died in the accident, but later revised the death toll to three.
“Until now, the joint rescue team is still conducting the search and rescue operation because the data is still developing,” Manado rescue agency head George Leo Mercy Randang told AFP on Monday.
“Our post is still open 24 hours a day, in case families want to report about their missing relative.” At least 568 people were rescued from the ferry and water while three others were found dead, the national search and rescue agency said in a statement Monday.
 
 

The ferry’s log had only registered 280 passengers and 15 crew on board.
Local media reported that the ship had a capacity for 600 people.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards or bad weather.
Sunday’s fire came just weeks after another ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali due to bad weather, killing at least 19 people.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra Island.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211007267323854.png?r=100801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925607/alaska-airlines-requests-grounding-of-fleet-citing-it-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Alaska Airlines requests grounding of fleet citing ‘IT outage’</strong></a><br><p>Alaska Airlines has requested a ground stop for all its mainline aircraft according to an advisory notice by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the company citing an “IT outage.”
The airline told AFP that on Sunday it “experienced an IT outage that’s impacting our operations” and that it “requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights until the issue is resolved.”
The FAA status page showed all destinations being impacted by the ground stop of Alaska’s mainline aircraft.
It did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comment.
The incident comes more than a year after a door plug section of a newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight between Portland, Oregon and Ontario, California in January last year.
The 171 passengers and six crew members survived the rapid decompression, but the incident focused minds at the FAA, which grounded many Boeing 737-9 aircraft operated by US airlines.
Last month, US investigators said Boeing’s failure to provide adequate training to manufacturing staff was a driving factor in the near-catastrophic Alaska Airlines mid-flight blowout.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614996-all-set-for-senate-polls-in-kp-as-four-pti-dissenters-pull-out-of-race' target='_blank'><strong>All eyes on KP Senate polls as voting underway to elect 11 senators</strong></a><br><p>

The report ‘Pakistan Energy Efficiency: Industrial Energy Efficiency and Decarbonisation (EE&D)’, outlines strategies, targeting the cement, steel, fertiliser, textile, and paper and pulp industries.
These plans aim to advance Pakistan’s energy conservation objectives and shape policy discussions between the WB Group and the government.
The strategies are based on a comprehensive study the bank conducted from mid-2022 to 2023.
While some manufacturers have already implemented EE&D technologies, the report identified major information, policy and financial barriers hindering wider adoption.
“Many companies in Pakistan believe that investments in energy efficiency raise production costs and erode competitiveness,” the report noted. “This wariness substantially increases when the term ‘decarbonisation’ is used instead of ‘energy efficiency’.”
Textile
In the textile industry, the dyeing and finishing stages are the most energy-intensive, offering the greatest potential for EE&D gains.
It can be achieved through multiple pathways such as energy efficiency and conservation interventions, fuel switching, electrification of heat, process improvement, implementing circularity and deploying innovative technologies.
According to the bank, the existing technologies can save 50pc to 60pc energy and cut emission by up to 13pc.
Cement, fertiliser
Several Pakistani cement plants have already implemented EE&D interventions, including installing waste heat recovery systems and adopting alternative energy sources.
The WB estimates that the industry can further reduce its emissions impact by 3pc to 35pc and decrease energy consumption by 6pc to 20pc by adopting existing and emerging technologies.
The fertiliser sector’s heavy reliance on natural gas makes it vulnerable to price volatility.
The report suggests that government policies providing a fixed and considerably low gas price for fertiliser manufacturers discourage investments in energy efficiency.
Steel, paper and pulp
All steel in Pakistan is produced from scrap metal in an electric induction furnace, the more efficient of the two applicable technologies.
The World Bank suggests that additional investments could reduce emissions from steel plants by 5pc to 12pc and lower energy consumption by 8pc to 10pc.
A better understanding of the financial impacts of decarbonisation could prompt more interest in these investments, the report added.
Paper and pulp industry has seen a compound annual growth rate of 7.2pc over the past five years. While some plants have invested in efficiency measures, the sector can further improve by adopting new technologies.

This will be the first cabinet-level meeting since President Trump’s unprecedented White House lunch with Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir. Such senior-level contacts had remained dormant since 2016, marking this as a significant diplomatic reset.
Mr Dar is arriving in New York on Sunday afternoon to participate in Pakistan’s high-level engagements under its current presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC), before traveling to Washington for bilateral meetings.
In New York, he will chair an open debate on “Promoting international peace and security through multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes.”

Foreign minister due in New York today

He will also preside over the quarterly UNSC debate on the “Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” and lead a high-level briefing focused on enhanced cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. He will also attend a conference on “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution.”
Still, the most consequential part of his visit remains the upcoming meeting with Secretary Rubio — signalling a resumption of strategic dialogue after years of limited contact.
Mr Dar’s visit follows Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s meeting with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington where they discussed a long-anticipated trade and tariff agreement.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb called the talks “very constructive” and emphasised that the bilateral relationship must go beyond trade. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he said.
“For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers,” the finance minister said before returning to Pakistan on Saturday.

• Seven police officials abducted in separate incidents
PESHAWAR/ QUETTA: Security forces killed 13 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations in Malakand and Kalat districts, the military said on Sunday.
Nine terrorists were eliminated and eight arrested in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, while four others were killed in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in separate statements.
The four-day intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Malakand was conducted in coordination with police, Levies, the Counter-Terrorism Dep­art­ment (CTD) and the district admi­nistration in Malakand district. The ISPR said the operation was launched after reports of the presence of militants linked to what the statement described as an “Indian proxy”.
The troops surrounded and effectively engaged the militants’ location and killed nine and arrested eight others after intense and multiple fire exchanges, the ISPR said, adding that two hideouts used by militants were also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered.
“Locals of the area appreciated the operation and expressed their full support to the state’s counterterrorism efforts,” the statement read.
It said that sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other militants in the area, as the security forces and law enforcement agencies, in step with the nation, were determined to wipe out the menace of militancy from the country.
In Kalat, four terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation conducted by security forces, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
The ISPR said the operation targeted the reported presence of militants associated with the Indian proxy group ‘Fitna al Hindustan’.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense exchange of fire, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.”
President, PM commend security forces
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday commended the security forces and Levies for eliminating “Khwarij terrorists” in the Malakand operation.
In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, he said the nation was united in its resolve to root out terrorism and vowed that “terrorists of Fitna al-Hindustan” would be brought to justice.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the army, police, Levies, CTD and district administration for the successful joint operation against “Fitna al-Khawarij terrorists” in Malakand.
“This successful operation against terrorists is a great example of coordination between different agencies,” he said. “The entire nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism.”
He expressed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Woman killed in ‘drone strike’
In a separate development, a woman was killed and two others injured in a suspected quadcopter drone strike, while seven police personnel were allegedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan district on Sunday.
According to local sources, the drone strike occurred in Malikshahi, a locality in the Zhawar area of Shaktoi tehsil. The attack killed a woman on the spot, while another woman and a young girl were injured and shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
The incident sparked panic among residents, who condemned the strike as a blatant violation of human rights. Locals called on authorities to take immediate notice and ensure justice for the victims.
The district administration confirmed the incident and expressed support for the affected family. However, District Police Officer (DPO) Arshad Khan said the department had “no idea” about the source or motive behind the attack.
 
 

No official statement was immediately issued regarding responsibility for the strike, further fuelling fear and speculation in the area.
Seven policemen abducted
Meanwhile, seven police officials, including a sub-inspector, were reportedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan.
DPO Khan confirmed that three policemen from Ladha police station went missing during routine patrol duty near the Chalerai area of Makin tehsil. Communication with the team was abruptly lost and their whereabouts remain unknown.
In a second incident, four more officers, including a sub-inspector, went missing from the Shahoor area within the jurisdiction of the Sararogha police station. The incidents have raised serious concerns among law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the region.
DPO Khan said a comprehensive investigation had been launched to determine all possible angles. Joint efforts by police, security forces and intelligence agencies are underway to locate the missing personnel.
The incidents have increased tensions and anxiety among locals.
Residents have demanded a transparent inquiry and swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The law and order situation in the tribal districts, particularly Upper and Lower South Waziristan and North Waziristan, has deteriorated significantly over the past year. The region has witnessed a sharp increase in militant activity, including bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom and coordinated attacks on security forces and police.
 
 

The increasing frequency of such incidents has instilled widespread fear among citizens, who are urging the government and security institutions to take swift and effective measures to restore order and ensure the safety of citizens.

As of Sunday night, six PTI nominees and five opposition picks were in the running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the upper house of parliament. Late-night reports suggested that two more ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates pulled out of the race hours after the exit of Mohammad Waqas Orak­zai and Syed Irshad Hus­sain. Khurram Zee­shan was the only disgruntled PTI member, till the filing of this report in the wee hours of Monday morning, vying for a general seat.
Proportional representation
Unlike the general elections, the ‘first past the post’ system (where the person receiving the highest number of votes is declared the winner) is not employed here.
Instead, the ‘single transferable vote’ system of proportional representation is used.
Under this system, voters cast a single ballot, which mentions all the candidates they would like to see elected, in order of their personal priority or preference (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on).
 
 

Each of these votes has a value. A quota calculated by the ECP determines how many votes each candidate needs to be considered elected.
The votes received by each candidate are tallied in each count. When a candidate receives enough votes to cross the quota, the extra value of his or her votes is transferred down to lower priority candidates (in the order mentioned by the voters).
The candidates who receive the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the order of preference.
The process of transferring votes from successful and eliminated candidates continues until all vacant seats are filled.
How many votes needed?
Theoretically, for the KP Assembly — which has a total of 145 seats — a candidate for one of seven general seats requires at least 21 votes to succeed (calculated by dividing the total number of seats in the KP Assembly by the number of vacant seats being contested).
For each of the women’s and technocrat seats, this number is 72.
Currently, there are 92 PTI-backed members in the 145-member assembly, whereas the opposition’s strength has gone up to 53.
Among opposition parties, JUI-F is the largest with 18 seats, followed by PML-N with 17 seats. The PPP holds 10 seats, ANP four, while PTI-P has three seats in the assembly.
Who are the candidates?
The PTI-backed Senate candidates on general seats include Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Muhammad Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri. For the technocrat and women’s seats, the party has named Muhammad Azam Khan Swati and Rubina Naz as its candidates, respectively.
The opposition-backed candidates include Attaul Haq of JUI-F, Muhammad Talha of PPP, Niaz Ahmad of PML-N on general seats, whereas Dilawar Khan of JUI-F is in the run for the technocrat seat, while the PPP has nominated Rubina Khalid for the women’s seat.
Based on the late-night reports, among the ‘disgruntled’ PTI members, Waqas Orakzai, Irfan Saleem, Irshad Hussain and Ayisha Bano had already exited the race, leaving Khurram Zeeshan in the race.

• PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab
• Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.
According to the PMD’s detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.
In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.
Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.
Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal­pindi, Murree, Gali­yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.
In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre­ady been reported from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.
The PMD said Mir­purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair­pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.
 
 

In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.
For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.
Rivers in high flood
A separate alert from the country’s  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  “moderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start” over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.
The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.
The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.
The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.
In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a “dual threat.”
“We are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,” Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.
The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.
In May, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.
“The appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,” the letter, dated July 8, read.
“Now the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.”
The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.
The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.
 
 

In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by Dawn.com that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.
Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p><small>2025-07-20 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614945-suspect-in-viral-honour-killing-video-arrested-confirms-balochistan-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Viral murder video prime suspect among 13 arrested in crackdown: CM Bugti</strong></a><br><p>
