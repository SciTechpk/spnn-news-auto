A sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
In a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, Mazari, through prominent lawyers including Kamran Murtaza, members of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) Raja Aleem Abbasi, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqub, Zafar Khokhar, Asif Irfan, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa, President Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, President District Bar Association Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, Riasat Ali Azad, and others, alleged that jail authorities had completely cut off the detainees from family contact and legal counsel, without any written order, recorded reasons, or lawful justification.
The petition states that Imaan and Hadi were convicted on January 24, 2026, in a case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and have since been held in “continuous judicial custody”. Despite repeated requests, the petitioner — mother of Imaan and mother-in-law of Hadi — has been denied visitation rights and kept in the dark about their physical and mental health, medical care, and jail conditions.
The plea contends that the detainees have also been deprived of confidential access to their lawyers, obstructing their ability to file an appeal against their conviction — a time-sensitive legal remedy. It argues that such “complete and indefinite denial” amounts to “incommunicado detention,” violating constitutional guarantees under Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14, which protect the rights to due process, dignity, fair trial, and humane treatment.
The petition further invokes the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, and international standards such as the UN Nelson Mandela Rules, asserting that the state has a heightened duty of care toward individuals in custody.
In her interim relief request, Mazari has urged the IHC to issue immediate directions allowing temporary family visits and legal consultations pending the final decision of the writ.
The respondents in the petition include the Federation of Pakistan through the secretary of Interior, the inspector general of police Islamabad, and the superintendent of Adiala Jail.
The IHC is yet to fix a hearing date on the petition.</p><small>2026-02-03 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131703d407f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970806/na-adopts-resolution-calling-for-aggressive-national-response-against-terrorisms-sponsors-facilitators' target='_blank'><strong>NA adopts resolution calling for ‘aggressive’ national response against terrorism’s sponsors, facilitators</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism.
The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which was passed with a majority vote.
It stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.”
The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”.







The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”.
It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”.
The resolution expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values.
It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”.
Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”.



The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday.
The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday.
Lawmakers sound alarm
Meanwhile, lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province.
At some points during a few opposition lawmakers’ speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel.
PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently.
“If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said.
JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district.
She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered.
“Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously.
She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister, women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”.
“For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan.
Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been on fire for the past 48 hours.
“We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said.
“Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked.







Badini remarked that a youth in Balochistan got exhausted after crying for his rights and then finally fell into someone’s hands, stressing this was not the time to talk about dividing Balochistan.
“Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted.
Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”.
He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor.
“Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised.
A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan.
In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed.
Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity.
Balochistan attacks

The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province.
According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response.
The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred.

 

The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan.
The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-03 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648751-pti-disowns-social-media-trolling-of-security-forces-after-balochistan-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>PTI disowns social media trolling of security forces after Balochistan attacks</strong></a><br><p>

Australia’s central bank joined Japan as the only developed-world economy to tighten policy, saying above-target inflation and a tight labour market justified a unanimous decision to lift the cash rate 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent.
Markets had mostly anticipated the move, though are now rushing to price in a follow-up in May, which was enough to push the Aussie about 1pc higher and over 70 US cents.
India’s rupee, and stocks cheered an announcement by US President Donald Trump that tariffs on Indian goods would be cut from 50pc to 18pc in return for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Details, however, were scarce.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei jumped 4pc to recoup Monday’s losses, and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 5pc.
S&P 500 futures ESc1 were up 0.1pc with traders eyeing a busy few sessions of earnings.
With so many positions stopped out by collapses in crowded silver and gold bets, investors were taking stock and sitting back, according to Steven Leung, director of institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
“It will take a long time for them to rebuild a bull or bear position…so they are staying away from the market,” he said.
Speculation that tax hikes on Chinese telcos could extend to internet giants dragged stocks such as Tencent and Alibaba down by more than 3pc.
Metals stabilise
Gold was up 3pc in Asia to $4,820 an ounce, a bounce of around 9pc from Monday’s lows. Silver traded 5pc higher to $83.34 an ounce.
Gold, silver, stocks, and the dollar have all whipsawed since Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve sent metal prices tumbling. Warsh is seen shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet, pushing up bond yields, which is negative for precious metals that pay no income.
However, the dive in prices on Friday and on Monday went beyond fundamentals and was a wipeout for leveraged positions and sent tremors through global commodity and stock markets as traders sold other assets to bail out losing bets.
Looking ahead, Wall Street earnings are in the frame, with chipmaker AMD and server equipment company Super Micro Computer due to report after market.
Takaichi trade
Currency markets were finding a level after last week’s sharp spike lower in the dollar. The euro bought $1.1809 in the Asia session, off highs hit above $1.20 late in January.
The yen traded at 155.41 per dollar and has retraced about half the gains it made on the greenback that followed talk of possible joint US-Japan intervention to boost the yen.
Polls show Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party heading for a landslide victory at the weekend’s election – putting pressure on bonds and the yen as it would hand a mandate to her agenda for fiscal loosening.
Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama on Tuesday was downplaying weekend remarks from Takaichi highlighting the benefits of a weak yen, at odds with the authorities’ efforts to support it.</p><small>2026-02-03 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03111019aee7509.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970798/american-colony-indian-opposition-slams-modis-bjp-government-for-us-india-trade-deal' target='_blank'><strong>‘American colony’: Indian opposition slams Modi’s BJP government for US-India trade deal</strong></a><br><p>The Indian National Congress on Tuesday criticised the Narendra Modi-led BJP government for the trade deal struck with the United States on Monday, calling on the government to take the country into confidence about the deal’s details.
United States President Donald Trump announced a “trade deal” with India on Monday after speaking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying New Delhi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and may purchase it instead from Venezuela.
“Just like the ceasefire, the announcement of the trade deal was also made by US President Trump. It has been stated that the trade deal is being done ‘on Modi’s request’,” the Congress said in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.
It slammed the move to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers against the US to zero, saying, “It seems India has agreed to completely open our market for America. This will impact Indian industry, traders and farmers.”
It also questioned whether the security and interests of Indian farmers had been ensured amid talk of opening the agriculture sector to the US, and whether the Modi government had agreed to the condition stated by Trump that it would no longer buy Russian oil.







“In addition, there is talk of buying more goods from America. If that’s the case, then what happened to ‘Make in India’?” the post added.
“India has the right to know details of the trade deal. The Modi government must take the Parliament and the entire country into confidence and share all the details.”
The Kerala chapter of Congress also slammed the move in briefer terms, saying, “Simply put, we will be an American colony.”
It pointed out that the US would still have a tariff of 18 per cent on Indian goods, while India would charge 0pc tariffs on American goods.
“Resign and get lost,” it said bluntly, addressing Modi.







In a separate post, the opposition party also called the deal “the lowest moment” for India and criticised Modi’s apparent bowing down to Trump.
“Narendra Modi surrendered India’s sovereignty to the US to keep his friend and himself out of jail,” it said, apparently referring to businessman and Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani.
“This is the lowest moment for the country. Complete surrender without even fighting!”







Congress member Jairam Ramesh, meanwhile, compared Modi’s stance now to his “surrender” during the Pakistan-India conflict in May 2025.
He said that while India-US relations had appeared bright at the start of Trump’s re-election, things had gone “downhill” ever since the US president’s halting of Operation Sindoor on May 10.
Ramesh said that Trump’s enthusiastic embracing of Pakistan, and Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, had “exposed the hollowness of Modi’s huglomacy”.
“From the information President Trump has provided, it is abundantly clear that Prime Minister Modi has — like he did on May 10, 2025 — completely surrendered.”
“He has most definitely appeased President Trump,” Ramesh said, adding, “India stands diminished by this unfortunate sequence of events.”
He called for both the EU and US trade deals to be laid on the table of both Houses and debated.







Congress member Supriya Shrinate expressed concern over the “deeply worrying” reaction of US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to the announcement, in which she said the deal would “export more American farm products to India’s massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America”.
“Modi had promised that he won’t compromise the interests of Indian farmers,” she said. “But America says there will be a massive surge in export of American agricultural products to India — how can India allow this?”







On the other hand, India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal, claiming that it would create more jobs, spur growth and promote innovation in both economies.
“It will strengthen ‘Make in India’ endeavors and encourage trusted technology ties,” he said on X. “The opportunities in our economic engagement are truly vast and we are confident of realising them.
“A robust economic relationship is the strongest foundation for our strategic partnership.”







After Trump’s announcement on Monday, Modi took to X to express his happiness with the reduction of tariffs on India.
“Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,” he wrote.
“I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights.”







Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January 2025, but that has not stopped difficult trade negotiations over the past year.
The trade talks fell apart last year, and Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50pc, the world’s highest rate, including a levy of 25pc in retaliation for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.</p><small>2026-02-03 07:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03115306a07c19f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970804/pakistan-azerbaijan-naval-chiefs-pledge-to-strengthen-bilateral-defence-ties-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan naval chiefs pledge to strengthen bilateral defence ties: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The naval chiefs of Pakistan and Azerbaijan have pledged to strengthen their existing bilateral defence relationship, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust defence cooperation. In 2024, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf met with Commander Azerbaijan Naval Forces (ANF) Rear Admiral Shahin Mammadov, at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad today, where the two leaders “pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of [the] existing bilateral defence relationship”.







The two, during the meeting, also “discussed matters of mutual interest, regional maritime security situation, and avenues for enhanced cooperation in training and defence”.
The Azeri naval commander, upon arrival at the headquarters, was presented with a guard of honour by “a smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Navy”.
“Thereafter, the dignitary laid a floral wreath at the Shuhada’s Monument,” ISPR said.
“Later, a briefing was also given to the visiting dignitary on Pakistan Navy’s ongoing projects,” the statement read.
“Pakistan and Azerbaijan share longstanding brotherly relations marked by close naval cooperation.
“The visit of commander Azerbaijan naval forces will further enhance bilateral collaboration between the two countries in general and navies in particular,” ISPR added.
Last year in August, Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister.</p><small>2026-02-03 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03115101ccd016b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970803/kse-100-up-1800-points-during-early-intraday-trading-on-tuesday' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 up 1,800 points during early intraday trading on Tuesday</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, was trading higher at 11:30am on Tuesday, up 1,801.31 points from its previous close.

There are no trees nearby, no shade. There is only the open road and the sun beating straight down.
The rabrri seller speaks about what Makli (located near Thatta in Sindh) used to be like two decades ago. “Even summers felt different then,” he says. In those days, thick trees lined the road, holding back the heat. Some evenings even brought a light drizzle, settling the dust and softening the air.
People lingered outside and animals existed in their natural habitats. It seemed like there was a balance to things and a natural order. But now, there is only heat — and the trucks.
MANUFACTURING HEAT
A truck loaded with freshly cut wood thunders past. Then another. Then another. All of them are headed towards Karachi with engines roaring, and timber stacked high and loose. Tree varieties of neem, babul and keekarr are all piled atop this truck. Their trunks look thick enough to have been standing for decades.

 

The trucks passing the rabrri seller’s stall are not an anomaly. They form a steady, visible supply chain running from lower Sindh into Karachi. Each one of these trucks carries with it more than wood. These trucks carry away shade from roads such as this one in Makli, cover from fields and riverbanks across Sindh, the homes of various local animals and birds, and the natural setting that gives rise to flora and fauna.

Trucks barrelling across Sindh loaded with illegally cut timber have become an alarmingly routine sight in the province. It is estimated that Sindh has lost nearly 80 percent of its forest cover since Pakistan came into being, much of it in the last 30 years. As this rabid deforestation in Sindh has led to heatwaves and other related calamities year-after-year, are officials simply turning a blind eye, or are they complicit? What policies have led us to this juncture, and can anything be done to reverse the damage?

According to numerous studies, deforestation and the removal of trees is directly linked to an increase in the intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Research shows that cutting down forests removes the cooling effect that trees provide, leading to local surface temperature increases of up to 4.5 degrees Celsius.
As a result of this slow, engineered erasure of the natural ecosystem across Sindh, hundreds of people and livestock are dying every year in the province, as recurring heatwaves continue to ravage the land.
According to a news report published in Dawn on June 22, 2025, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh stated that “the 2024 heatwave alone led to 5,358 hospital admissions for heat-related illnesses and 158 livestock deaths. During the period between April and May, 2025, 675 heatstroke cases were treated across the province. Overall, an estimated 8.6 million people across 26 districts in Sindh faced heightened food insecurity due to compounding heat and drought risks.”

 

This naturally begs the question: given the direct causation between deforestation and the increase in heat-related calamities and ailments, why are the authorities in the province allowing Sindh’s trees to be mowed down?
According to drivers and residents familiar with these routes, each truck pays around Rs 4,000 to officials from the Sindh Forest Department in order to move freely across these lands. Trucks carrying timber from Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta and lower Sindh funnel onto the National Highway N-5 for Karachi. On average, one truck passes every 15 minutes. That amounts to roughly 96 trucks a day. On a single route, that is Rs 384,000 changing hands daily. Over a month, the figure exceeds Rs 11.5 million.
A truck driver tells Eos, “Pay and you can go anywhere. If you don’t pay, then you’re in trouble.” None of the trucks display visible permits and none of them are stopped for inspection at checkpoints.
The Sindh Forest Department, which has publicly emphasised reclamation of encroached lands and afforestation drives, did not respond to requests for comments on the operation of these trucks and the seeming absence of any checks and balances.
These trucks that have, in the words of the rabrri seller, “eaten everything” did not appear overnight. In fact, Sindh’s forests have been slowly dismantled in stages over nearly two centuries now, but the scale and impact has never been this large.
A HISTORY OF DESTRUCTION
When the British annexed Sindh in 1843, the Indus riverine forests were among the first landscapes to be surveyed, mapped and claimed. Timber from babul and keekarr fed railway expansion, cantonments and canal construction.
Forests ceased to be living systems and became inventories. Large stretches of riverine forests were cleared to serve colonial infrastructure and revenue needs as floodplains were also regulated.
In 1932, the Sukkur Barrage diverted water, thus reducing inundations and riverine regeneration. After Partition, the same logic persisted, as Pakistan inherited colonial forest laws. In 1947, the Sindh Forest Department inherited and managed 269,511 hectares of reserved forests and 24,369 hectares of protected forests, mainly riverine forests along the Indus floodplains. These figures marked the baseline for productive cover in the province, with dense stands of babul, keekarr and other species regenerating naturally through annual inundations.
Since then, the nominal area of riverine forests has stayed roughly stable on official records at 241,198 hectares, as per the Sindh Forest Department, reflecting a modest nominal decline of about 28,313 hectares from the 1947 reserved figure.

 

Yet, the effective loss is much steeper due to degradation, encroachment, illegal felling and reduced freshwater flows from barrages. Estimates indicate that up to 80 per cent of riverine forests have been destroyed or heavily degraded.
By the 1950s, barrages such as Guddu and Kotri intensified the issue. The average annual flow from the Kotri Barrage dropped from 41 million acre-feet (MAF) during 1976-1998 to 14 MAF during 1999-2023. By the 1980s and 1990s, forest land in Sindh increasingly existed only on paper. Forest boundary pillars disappeared, while guards were few, poorly paid and easily overruled.
Between the 1980s and early 2000s, Sindh’s forest cover declined drastically, with riverine forests in some areas shrinking by more than two-thirds or more — from over 20 percent to under seven percent of mapped study areas.
Province-wide, Sindh likely lost 50 to 80 percent of its forested areas compared to its mid-20th century levels, with most of that reduction happening through the late 20th century and into the early 2000s.

POLICY FAILURES
In 2005, the Sindh government introduced its Agroforestry Policy, officially aimed at increasing tree cover through private participation. In practice, it opened vast tracts of riverine and irrigated forests to leasing.
Natural forests were often cleared first and replantation was promised later. But oversight weakened as plantation targets were rarely enforced and influential landlords received leases. Environmental impact assessments arrived years late, if at all.
As a result, while it was designed to increase tree cover by engaging local communities, the policy led to widespread deforestation, as land was often acquired by individuals who prioritised agricultural cultivation over planting trees.
Despite this, by 2010, the policy was expanded. Lease terms were relaxed and more land was handed out as forests continued to vanish. In 2014, the policy was officially scrapped. The government announced the reclamation and restoration of encroached lands.
According to the Sindh Sustainable Forest Management Policy 2019, published on May 18, 2023 and available on the Sindh Forest Department’s website, one of the major factors behind the decrease in forest cover has been the “weak law enforcement of the forestry administration.”
It also cites the Agroforestry Lease Policy of 2005 as being “detrimental for the forests.”

 

The Sindh Forest Department has routinely taken budgetary allocations from provincial and federal governments specifically for the purpose of reclaiming encroached forest lands.
But a persistent critique from environmental groups and after media investigations is that a cycle has been created, where funds are drawn for clearance operations while powerful encroachers are still allowed to delay or avoid eviction, thus letting the deforestation continue. This highlights a recurring failure of governance, where policies — whether for leasing or for reclamation — are undermined by weak enforcement and a lack of transparency.



According to the Sindhi newspaper Pehnji Ikhbar, as of January 25, 2026, 75,000 acres of forest department land in Matiari have continuously been handed over to contractors who permit tree-cutting. Despite court orders and government restrictions, wood is still being cut from forest lands and government lands are being cultivated, with the forest department remaining a silent spectator.
Furthermore, the Nasri Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad district (previously known as Nawabshah) has been granted to Bahria Town for the development of their third mega project in the area. Environmentalists and local residents have raised concerns that this move will lead to large-scale deforestation, an increase in temperature, loss of biodiversity and the disruption of the local ecosystem.
IGNORANCE OR COMPLICITY?
Ayaz Samoo has been cutting wood for over 20 years. He has spent decades working in forests, felling trees with skill and precision — first with axes and saws, now with machines. He used to cut trees by relying only on strength, experience and patience. “Back then, it was all hands and sweat,” he says. “Every tree has its own rhythm. You had to move carefully, understand it, or you could get hurt.”
Today, machines have changed his work. Chainsaws roar through the forest where once only the sound of axes filled the air. “It is faster now, yes,” he explains, “but you do not ‘feel’ the tree in the same way.” That’s because cutting down trees has become a ruthlessly profitable business that is coming at the cost of the province and its people.
Advocate Ammar Dayo, a vocal campaigner against deforestation and climate destruction in northern Sindh, calls the situation in Ghotki district “unprecedented”. “During the last three years, forest destruction here has reached levels never seen before,” he says.
“The years 2024 and 2025 have been catastrophic for the following forests: Mirpur, Jahanpur, Adilpur, Jarwar, Sardar, Sandrani and Ronte.
“The Sindh Forest Department is 100 percent involved in this,” Dayo claims. “From conservators to DFOs [divisional forest officers] to guards. Along with them, influential politicians, landlords, the police and even some local residents are involved.”
In the Mirpur and Jahanpur forests, Dayo says mature babul trees — worth Rs 300,000 to Rs 400,000 per tree — have been cut and sold by the thousands. In Jror, Adilpur and Ronte forests, he estimates millions of keekarr and babul trees have been removed.
Court orders banning sawmills within 10 kilometres of forest boundaries exist. On the ground, however, sawmills operate inside forest limits, cutting timber into planks and beams that are then loaded on to trucks. But the men cutting the trees are not the men profiting from them.
In rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting. Daily wages are low, work is seasonal and alternatives are scarce as timber offers quick cash. The legal, ecological and climatic concerns are abstract to these men. Their hunger is not. A cutter in Sujawal tells Eos, “We cut for 500 rupees a day. The agents pay us and we use the money to get food for ourselves and our families.”
But this is only a short-term monetary fix for a long-term monetary disaster. As forests shrink, pastoralists lose grazing land, heat exposure increases, livestock dwindles, families migrate towards cities already stretched thin and poverty deepens.
A MAN-MADE CALAMITY
Environmental expert Nasir Panhwar describes riverine forests not just as scenery but as infrastructure, and this infrastructure is being dismantled.
“Biodiversity has been lost,” Panhwar says. “Some flora and fauna have disappeared entirely. Migration is underway because livelihoods dependent on forests and water are collapsing.”
He estimates that up to 80 per cent of Sindh’s riverine forests have been destroyed.
Official figures by the Sindh Forest Department paint a similar picture. Productive forests — riverine and irrigated plantations — now account for around just two per cent of Sindh’s land area. Nationally, Pakistan’s forest cover stands at around 4.7 per cent, among the lowest in the region.

 

In Sindh, riverine forests have faced sharper degradation despite nominal stability in managed areas. In Thatta district alone, riverine area fell from 45,128 hectares in 1990 to 36,432 hectares in 2010 and then to 25,888 hectares by 2014 — an overall decline of about 43 per cent in that district, with other studies showing up to 89 per cent loss in Thatta’s forest cover from 1979 to 2010 (from 35.11 per cent to 2.23 per cent).
As of 2025, Pakistan has only five trees per person, as per the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) estimates — far below the global average of 422 and the desirable 900 for sustainability. In Sindh, it’s lower still due to urban pressures and riverine loss.
And, as forests vanish, heat intensifies.
Trees lower surface temperatures, retain moisture and break heatwaves. Without them, roads and fields absorb sunlight. Nights offer no relief. A single mature tree provides shade for 10 people, cools the air by 2-5 degrees Celsius through evapotranspiration and absorbs 22 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) yearly. In order to offset Sindh’s heat, one person would need a now-impossible number of around 200-300 trees.
Nisar Laghari, a political activist from Hyderabad, disputes official figures on the scale of forest loss, arguing that even existing data understates the damage. According to him, Miani Forest historically spanned nearly 2,500 acres, stretching from the riverine belt up to Hyderabad Taluka. “Local records still show the forest at 2,500 acres,” he says, “but satellite mapping today reduces it to around 1,700 acres, already masking a significant loss.”
Laghari alleges that of the land still visible on satellite imagery, 150 to 200 acres have been converted into agricultural fields through political pressure, while much of the remaining area is under illegal occupation. Adjacent to Miani Forest lies the Nawab Muhammad Khan Forest, covering another 500 acres, which he argues must be counted as part of the same ecological system when assessing total deforestation.
“The destruction was not accidental,” Laghari says. “It became systematic when forest leases began to be issued, despite the fact that forest land is not legally eligible for leasing.” Those leases, he claims, opened the forest to commercial cutting and cultivation, fragmenting what was once a continuous green belt into isolated, degraded patches.
Independent verification of these claims remains limited, but historical maps, satellite imagery and local testimony all point towards decades of gradual, policy-enabled deforestation rather than sudden encroachment.

HOW TO RIGHT A WRONG
Internationally, Pakistan presents itself as a climate victim — and it is. The country ranks among the world’s most climate-affected nations as it continues to be battered by floods, heatwaves and many other disasters.
Ironically, Sindh has become a focal point for blue carbon projects, especially mangrove restoration, thus attracting international attention, consultants and seed funding. Carbon credits are calculated, maintenance budgets are allocated and photo opportunities multiply.
But such efforts are futile if the broader picture across Sindh is ignored by the authorities. The province’s lungs are being depleted, and those tasked with protecting these forests are instead aiding in their destruction through negligent policymaking and a failure to enforce more stringent measures.

 

It is important to stress that deforestation in Sindh is a governance failure. The steady disappearance of riverine forests and inland tree cover reflects weak policy frameworks, institutional complicity and the marginalisation of communities who once acted as de facto custodians of the land. Addressing this problem requires more than tree-planting drives or donor-funded campaigns. It demands structural reform, transparency and a reimagining of how forests are governed in the province.
Reforming the Sindh Forest Department must be the starting point. The department currently suffers from overlapping mandates, poor accountability mechanisms and limited independent oversight. Forest officers wield extensive discretionary power over permits and enforcement, creating opportunities for rent-seeking and collusion with timber mafias. Introducing an independent forest oversight authority could help break this cycle. Regular third-party audits, public disclosure of logging permits and mandatory reporting of forest cover changes would make it harder for illegal activity to thrive under bureaucratic cover.
Closely tied to institutional reform is the need for a clear, enforceable forest policy. Sindh’s forest laws are outdated and often poorly aligned with current land-use realities. Ambiguous classifications such as ‘protected’, ‘reserved’ and ‘unclassed’ forests are routinely exploited to justify encroachment and conversion. Updating forest legislation to remove loopholes, clarify land tenure and impose stricter penalties for illegal logging is essential. Equally important is ensuring that these laws are actually enforced, rather than selectively applied against small-scale offenders while large operators go untouched.
Additionally, both the riverine trees and the mangroves in Sindh need the silt from the Indus in order to flourish, so the Indus River must also be allowed to flow if trees are to grow freely in Sindh once again.
Technology can also play a transformative role in improving enforcement and transparency. Satellite imagery, drone surveillance and real-time forest monitoring systems are already being used successfully in other countries to track deforestation. Sindh could adopt some similar tools to create a publicly accessible forest monitoring dashboard, showing changes in tree cover, district by district. When deforestation becomes visible and verifiable, denial becomes harder and accountability easier.
At the same time, economic incentives must be realigned.
Deforestation persists in part because cutting trees is often more profitable than conserving them. The provincial government can counter this by expanding payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes, where communities are compensated for maintaining forest cover that provides flood protection, carbon sequestration and climate resilience. Agroforestry models that integrate trees into agricultural land can also reduce pressure on natural forests while supporting rural incomes.

 

Finally, deforestation in Sindh has persisted because it rarely carries political consequences. Legislators, ministers and senior bureaucrats must be held publicly accountable for forest loss in their jurisdictions. Environmental protection cannot remain a peripheral concern in a province increasingly vulnerable to climate change.
In the end, reversing deforestation in Sindh is less about planting more trees and more about fixing the systems that allow them to be cut down with impunity. Without institutional reform, legal clarity, community involvement and transparent governance, even the most ambitious afforestation campaigns will amount to little more than greenwashing.
These solutions are not anything new or revolutionary, but what remains uncertain is whether the province’s political and bureaucratic leadership is willing to implement them.
OF TRUCKS AND TORMENT
The trucks do not stop even when the sun sets. Even after the Sindh government announced a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials, which came into effect around November 2025, the loads keep moving in the dark.
The order was meant to curb illegal cutting, give checkpoints better visibility and strengthen forest conservation efforts. But on stretches such as the Thatta-Karachi bypass and the National Highway, N-5, trucks carrying trees continue to roll through the night. Locals say the ban exists mostly on paper, so the wood keeps flowing out from rural Sindh through the night too.
And when the rabrri seller will open his stall in the morning once again, the trucks loaded with timber will still be flowing past.

“Today we cannot talk about having dialogue with the United States, but it is true that there have been communications between the two governments,” deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio said in an interview.
Trump on Sunday claimed the United States was in talks with “the highest people” in Cuba and that he expected to “make a deal” with its leadership, without saying what a deal might look like.
De Cossio repeated that Cuba was “open to dialogue” with the United States amid calls from Cubans for the government to negotiate to avert a humanitarian crisis.
Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Havana since the January 3 capture by US special forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a top Cuba ally and financial backer.
Pressured by Washington, Venezuela’s new administration has cut crude shipments to Cuba.
Trump said Monday that Cuba’s other main supplier, Mexico, would also “cease sending them oil” after he threatened tariff rises on any country that allowed Cuba to circumvent the de facto blockade. There was no immediate response from Mexico.
The United States’ largest trading partner had incurred Trump’s ire by sending oil to Cuba to make up for a sharp decline in Venezuela’s output under Maduro.



As recently as December, Mexico was still sending crude to Cuba.
President Claudia Sheinbaum had been loathe to cut the lifeline to Cuba, warning of a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis directly affecting hospitals, food supplies, and other basic services for the Cuban people.”
But she also admitted last week: “We don’t want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs.” A decree signed by Trump last week effectively forced her and other Cuban partners to choose.
The highest people
The pressure tactics threaten to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with its power stations already struggling to keep the lights on due to fuel shortages.
Jorge Grosso, a 23-year-old student who spent nearly 24 hours last week queueing at a petrol station to fill up his Lada, told AFP he backed talks “to see what conditions are imposed (by Trump) because in the end they’re strangling us.” For months Cubans have been forced to cope with power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day in rural areas.
On Monday, Trump repeated his claim that Cuba, which is limping through its worst economic crisis in decades, is a “failed nation.” He added he believed “we are pretty close (to a deal), but we are dealing with the Cuban leaders right now.”
His pressure on Sheinbaum comes as the United States and its southern neighbour begin talks on a review of a tripartite free trade deal with Canada, which is crucial to Mexico’s economy.
Over the past year, Sheinbaum has been scrambling to stave off the kind of tariff pain Trump has imposed on other allies.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to appease him, Mexico in January imposed stiff tariffs on imports from China.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0308413910f08ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970788/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-no-deal-reached-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns of ‘bad things’ if no deal reached with Iran</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck.
Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.







Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression.
Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks.
“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X.
The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said.







A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
‘Police the world’
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”.
Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.”
The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January.
Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes US and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt.
Ambassadors summoned
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.
Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”.
“It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP.
“We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.”
The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies.
The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”.
Baqaei said on Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come.
Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities.
Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031113591a6fc54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970792/pakistan-to-participate-in-us-critical-minerals-moot-seeks-strategic-partnerships-and-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in US critical minerals moot, seeks strategic partnerships and investment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is participating in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State on Wednesday, as Islamabad seeks to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik is representing Pakistan at the two-day conference, which is expected to bring together delegations from more than 50 countries to discuss strengthening and diversifying global supply chains for critical minerals—materials essential for advanced technologies, clean energy transitions and defence industries.
Hosting the meeting, the US State Department said the ministerial aims to “advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains” and to create momentum for international collaboration to secure resources “vital to technological innovation, economic strength, and national security”.
Opening remarks at the conference are scheduled to be delivered by US Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley, and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg. Secretary Rubio is also due to hold a press availability with visiting delegations.
Pakistan plans to use the forum to highlight its largely untapped mineral potential, including reserves of copper, gold and rare earth elements. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation on the development and processing of critical minerals, reflecting what officials describe as expanding US–Pakistan engagement in this strategic area.
Minister Malik arrived in Washington on Sunday evening with a delegation of senior officials and technical experts who oversee Pakistan’s efforts to deepen foreign investment and international collaboration, particularly through enhanced engagement with friendly partners.
According to the State Department, “strengthening critical mineral supply chains with our international partners is vital to America’s economic and national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future.”
US officials say the discussions are expected to focus on supply-chain resilience, investment frameworks, and sustainable mining, processing and recycling capabilities.
The invitation list reflects a growing coalition of mineral-rich and industrial nations, including G7 members, India, South Korea, Australia and several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Kenya. The DRC, in particular, is expected to be represented at the highest level, with President Félix Tshisekedi attending alongside his mining minister.
For Pakistan, participation in the Washington gathering aligns with broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment, while avoiding entanglement in major-power rivalry over control of these resources.
Pakistan has invited both China and the US to the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF) 2026, scheduled for April 8–9 in Islamabad, aiming to secure investment for an estimated $6–8 billion in annual mineral export potential.
The forum will focus on copper, gold and rare earth minerals, with an emphasis on deepening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)–related cooperation with Beijing, while also engaging other international partners.
Pakistan’s delegation is expected to remain in Washington through the end of the week to participate in related sessions and hold bilateral meetings with government and industry counterparts.</p><small>2026-02-03 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/030933239a737b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697/back-channel-talks-underway-after-pakistan-decide-to-skip-india-t20-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>‘Back-channel talks underway after Pakistan decide to skip India T20 World Cup clash’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The government of Pakistan’s decision on Sunday not to play its T20 World Cup group match against India, scheduled for Feb 15, has prom­pted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to initiate back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses, Dawn has learnt.
The decision was announced around 15 days ahead of the scheduled fixture, giving the ICC sufficient time to explore possible options, including accommodating any reservations Pakistan may have, sources said.
According to sources, a couple of other cricket boards have also stepped in to assist the ICC in its efforts to reach an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Pakistan announced its decision without citing a specific reason for boycotting the match against India. In the past, however, Australia and the West Indies forfeited their World Cup matches against Sri Lanka in 1996 on security grounds following instructions from their governments. England and New Zealand similarly forfeited matches against Zimbabwe and Kenya, respectively, during the 2003 World Cup on political grounds.
Some quarters have termed Pakistan’s move a mistake, noting that unlike previous instances involving other teams, no explicit justification was provided. Sources, however, said the PCB has factored this into its position and plans to rely on proceedings of the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in a case filed by Pakistan against India in 2018.
That case stemmed from India’s failure to honour a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2014, under which the two countries were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
In return, the PCB had supported the ICC’s ‘Big Three’ revenue-sharing model, under which India, Australia and England received a larger share of ICC revenues.
“During the hearing, the PCB asked the BCCI to explain its refusal to tour Pakistan,” a sou­r­ce familiar with the 2018 proceedings said. “Initially, the BCCI stated that it was not obliged to provide a reason. Later, it claimed that the Indian government had not allowed the tour.”
When the PCB requested written instructions from the Indian government, the BCCI responded that such decisions were conveyed verbally and not documented, the source added.
Despite this, sources expressed concerns that, as in 2018, the BCCI influence within the ICC could again result in a ruling against Pakistan, potentially leading to financial penalties or sanctions. In such an event, the government of Pakistan may consider approaching an international court of arbitration, sources said.
It is believed that Pakistan’s decision was influenced by a recent ICC ruling involving Bangladesh. The ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to shift its World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka on security grounds and instead excluded Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing it with Scotland. The decision was passed by a 14-2 majority, with only Pakistan and Bangladesh voting against the move.
The India-Pakistan fixture is considered the most lucrative match in world cricket and a cornerstone of the ICC’s revenue model. Media reports estimate its overall commercial value at around $500 million, factoring in broadcast rights, advertising premiums, sponsorships, ticket sales and ancillary commercial activity. Advertising slots during an India-Pakistan T20 typically fetch between Rs2.5 million and Rs4 million for 10 seconds.
Following Pakistan’s announcement, the ICC issued a strongly worded statement, urging the PCB to “explore a mutually acceptable resolution which protects the interests of all stakeholders”.
“The ICC notes the statement made by the government of Pakistan regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said. “While the ICC awaits official communication from the PCB, selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event.”
“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competition,” it added.
While acknowledging the role of governments in matters of national policy, the ICC warned that the decision was “not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”.
There are reports that even if Pakistan maintains its stance, the Indian team will travel to Colombo for the scheduled match. If Pakistan do not field a team at the appointed time, India are expected to claim the points under tournament regulations.

On Aug 2, Iraq invaded the tiny emirate over a festering oil resource-sharing dispute. Saddam believed he had the approval of April Glaspie, the US ambassador in Baghdad. She had met him a week before the invasion. Controversy arose from reports that she told Hussein the US had “no opinion” on Arab-Arab conflicts, interpreted as a ‘green light’ to invade. She later defended her actions, claiming the transcript was misleading and she had warned against violence. In other words, Glaspie gave Saddam Hussein a go-ahead for conflict but without violence. Figure that out.
That year, a journalist friend requested some footage of the Muharram procession in my ancestral qasbah of Mustafabad about 100 kilometres from Lucknow. It so happened that Ashura in 1990 coincided in India with the Aug 2 invasion of Kuwait, the variation in date caused by a near routine difference of opinion among the clergy in the sighting of the new moon. I remember the date because the tension in the Middle East was a major discussion for radio addicts in Mustafabad. I took a friendly cameraman to film the Ashura procession replete with the tazias, zuljinah, horse depicting Imam Husain’s loyal and wounded steed, and a very high standard, the alam, held by a muscular adult and controlled by three others with the help of ropes. The cameraman found a perch on a balcony from where elite womenfolk usually got a clear view of the maatam. The practice involved copious bloodletting with self-flagellation. A sharp knife or qama was handed to willing adults to lacerate their scalps with turn by turn.
The cameraman was a genial Nair Hindu from Kerala. He was steeped in his work for a few short minutes. Then suddenly there was commotion in the balcony. The camera on the tripod was working, but the man was nowhere in sight. It turned out he had fainted, and some of the women were fanning him hard. I first thought it was the blazing sun and the humidity of August, which may have caused him to faint. But he had passed out, he told me later, after taking close-ups of the gushing blood that was mixed with rosewater by the procession’s monitors. The rosewater water is considered a healing agent.
Tatbir or ritual self-flagellation with blades has been officially banned in Iran since the mid-1990s by state authorities. While some Shias in India and Pakistan still practise this form of maatam, it is not common in Iran.

Perhaps Iran can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how.

Ayatollah Khomeini frowned on the qama zani or striking the head with swords and knives. His successor Ali Khamenei banned it, citing the harm it causes to the body and the negative image created by the practice. Mourning in Iran in memory of Imam Husain and his family focuses on emotional lamentation and seena zani or beating of the chest. The cameraman’s fear was writ large.
Iran’s detractors including Donald Trump or Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to understand this aspect of the faith. It’s practised in Iran by teeming followers of the revolution. Over the years and particularly in the early days of the revolution, Iran successfully endured major assaults from groups within the country largely due to its religious cohesion. The faux Marxist Mujahideen-i-Khalq (MEK) militants staged devastating attacks in the heart of Tehran without significantly denting the government’s hold on its supporters. They blew up prime minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar’s office killing him and president Mohammad Ali Rajai and several eminent members of the regime.

 

The closest MEK came to targeting the highest echelon of the revolution was their being linked to the assassination of Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, Khomeini’s charismatic confidante and potential successor. They then exploded a bomb that crippled the current Supreme Leader’s right hand. All this was happening when Iran was fighting a bitter war with the US-backed army of Saddam Hussein over eight years. What threat can work against a culture that celebrates grief, annually, perpetually? Recent violence against the clerical regime spurred on by the US and Israel also leaned on the MEK, the communists turned CIA’s catspaw. Israel’s nearly successful attempt to decapitate Iran saw the country take the hit and bounce back to turn the tables on Israel. Perhaps the country can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how.
What Trump may benefit from knowing a little more laterally is the frequently doubted but steadily articulated Iranian doctrine against producing a nuclear weapon. There is indeed a conversation going on in the country about the merits of having or shunning nuclear weapons, but who are the interlocutors in case they are talking to each other, which they are probably not? The silent tiff has terrifying implications for the region, not least for Israel. A fatwa by Ayatollah Khamenei is cited as the basis for Iran forsaking nuclear weapons. In a religiously conservative country, who could challenge the Supreme Leader’s authority? One group does; the Hojjatiyeh, a traditionalist, largely conservative Shia lay organisation in Iran, founded in the 1950s by cleric Mahmoud Halabi.
Formed to target Bahais, the Hojjatiyeh believe in creating circumstances for the early return of Imam Mahdi. “Bia Bia Mahdi Bia, Ya Waaris-i-Khana-i-Khuda.” The chant implicitly beckons the early end of the world. Khomeini was wary of the group and got some vocal leaders arrested. A change of guard in Iran, something that Saddam Hussein attempted unsuccessfully, would only strengthen those that see themselves as destined for paradise as soon as a nuclear exchange is enabled. Which is neither good for the world nor the cameraman.

Though details continue to be sketchy, a number of cities in the province were targeted, including Quetta, Gwadar and Noshki. It was reported that the attacks were repulsed and over 100 terrorists killed (the number continues to rise). Nonetheless the multiple events on Saturday morning have once again drawn attention to a conflict in our midst that everyone prefers to overlook.
Around a year ago, the province had experienced a similar spate of coordinated attacks in August 2024 on Akbar Bugti’s death anniversary. And for this reason for most of August 2025, there was a security clampdown in the province, with little to no internet coverage to prevent a repeat. The government ensured August passed quietly, only for January to turn explosive.
The attack had apparently begun much earlier than it was reported on the mainstream media, which is understandable at one level. The security organisations want to get the situation under control before it is reported so that the spread of misinformation and disinformation is limited. But in this day and age, the downside was that for a few hours, the information flow was dominated by the other side (on social media) while mainstream media in Pakistan kept running routine news of politicians and their speeches. The latter was of little interest to those who were busy scrolling on their phones.
The attacks have again set off a debate in which one side views the attacks as the desperate acts of externally supported militants who achieve very little eventually. On the other side is the view that such attacks show the weakening of the state’s writ and its ability to maintain normalcy in territory (which is different from losing it) and its ‘ability’ to win over the people.

The insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan.

The province’s chief minister was on a talk show on Sunday evening where he argued that the attacks were an act of desperation because the terrorists had suffered considerable losses in the past year. He claimed that operations in the past year had eliminated around 1,000 of them and added that the total number of terrorists and facilitators was not more than 5,000 to 6,000. At a later stage, he said, according to a survey by the government, only two or three per cent of the ordinary people supported the militants.

 

He also described the insurgency as the swings of the pendulum and explained that appeasement in the near past had led to the terrorists becoming stronger; the appeasement was blamed on past civilian governments which did not support the military.
But the pendulum argument does not explain how this crisis will end — after all, this insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan. And neither does it explain the increasing lethality of the attacks; most experts agree the militants are becoming more lethal and better trained with time. And neither does it throw light on their increasing success in recruiting educated, middle-class youth. Perhaps this is why the insurgency has continued for so long; instead of being led by individual tribal sardars, it is now being fuelled by a class which is proving more resilient. This educated class includes women some of whom are now seen as involved in the fighting as well.
These issues will need to be explored in more detail than simply focusing on the external support being provided. It is not enough to rejoice in the terrorists’ inability to hold on to territory but to ask why there is no normalcy in large swathes of the province, including its seat of government in Quetta. From one angle, instead of a pendulum swing, it might appear to be a steep decline.
Here, it is also important to address two more difficult questions. One is to ask how the imprisonment of women protesters, such as Mahrang Baloch, has helped with the security situation as it sends out the message that peaceful protests are not acceptable — leading many to conclude that for those who feel their voices are not being heard, violence is the only option.
Second, is the issue of genuine representation in the province, which is also inextricably linked to the popularity of women protesters. For there is a connection between the people of Balochistan opting for peaceful protests (and more) and the perceived unfairness of the elections in the province.
The widespread disillusionment with the electoral process has led many people to look at protests and violence as a means of influencing the state. And regardless of how legitimate or illegitimate the methods are seen to be, and the way to deal with them, it is essential that people be enticed back to the electoral process. And this is a problem that has become a widespread crisis of faith.
This was brought home last year when I was able to visit Quetta with the HRCP. It was evident that nearly every political party complained of unfair elections. From ethno-based political parties, which represented the Baloch as well as those which dominated the Pakhtun areas to the Hazaras, conversations with most of them were punctuated by the phrase ‘Form 45’. It is noteworthy that the representatives of the Hazaras did not speak of security but unfair elections. This is something that should worry us all; just as much as we fret about the interference of external forces and their support for terrorism. It is important the citizens of Balochistan need to be convinced of the options available to them in order to influence the state — and these options need to be more credible than simply holding a meaningless election.

The attacks in the province did not just occur in some far-flung corner of Balochistan; the terrorists managed to hit Quetta and Gwadar, indicating their reach and level of preparedness. The administration, therefore, needs to stay two steps ahead of violent actors not just in Balochistan, but across the country.
Security forces have managed to neutralise nearly 180 terrorists over the past two days in the province. While this may quell the immediate threat, in the long run better intelligence is needed to thwart violent elements before they can strike.
The year 2025 was exceptionally bloody where terrorist violence is concerned. As the military’s spokesman’s told a presser last month, there were nearly 5,400 terror incidents last year. This has resulted in the loss of over 1,200 security men and civilians, according to ISPR’s count.
In the first month of the current year, the signs do not look promising. As per the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, there were at least 87 terrorist attacks in January, up from 68 in December 2025, resulting in the martyrdom of at least 119 civilians and security personnel. And in keeping with past trends, the bulk of terrorist activity occurred in KP and Balochistan. Meanwhile, the US publication Foreign Affairs has said Pakistan could face more terrorist attacks originating from across the border in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
In light of these grim details, the state must act with alacrity. As many observers are pointing out, the Balochistan attacks signal a major security failure, and had LEAs not reacted in time, greater havoc could have been caused. The Balochistan chief minister highlighted the LEAs’ role while speaking on Sunday.

 

Whether it is Baloch terrorists backed by India, TTP terrorists supported by Kabul or any other terrorist group working to destabilise Pakistan, the state must shore up its defences to prevent more loss of innocent life. The ISPR head has said there were over 75,000 intelligence-based operations in 2025. The state — both its civilian and military arms — as well as counterterrorism experts, needs to examine the gaps that allowed such a large number of terrorist attacks last year despite such a high frequency of IBOs, and how violent actors continue to organise, as the Balochistan episode has shown.
Far too many security personnel have fallen fighting terrorists, while a large number of civilians have also been martyred. A revised and more effective CT policy is, therefore, needed to permanently quell the terrorist menace.

Talking to media persons here on Monday, Mr Reza said suspect Waseem Akhtar Sheikh had escaped with the gold belonging to his fellows of the same market.
He was later booked in multiple FIRs lodged by the victims with the Ichhra police besides his stepmother.
The DIG said the mystery of fraud involving gold worth hundreds of millions of rupees of the traders of Ichhra Sarafa (gold) Market has almost been resolved.
“The investigation police recovered from the nominated accused person 1,734 grams of gold,” Zeeshan Reza said.
A cash of more than Rs30 million was also recovered from him in addition to some vehicles.
After snatching gold from traders, the suspect had fled the market and gone underground in Islamabad.
“Before committing the [pre-planned] crime, the suspect had sold his house and all vehicles belonging to him and his family,” he said.
Immediately after registration of the FIR, different teams of the investigation police were tasked, said Reza.
“During the course of the investigation, we also ensured that the suspect does not flee abroad and is arrested as soon as possible”, said the DIG.
Investigation was carried out using modern technology and human intelligence from both aspects so that maximum recovery could be ensured.
To a question, he said some 20 cases were registered against the suspect at the respective police station so far.

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday frowned upon the tendency of approaching appellate courts by government departments in a mechanical way by filing frivolous petitions on settled principles.
In a six-page judgement on a tax matter, a three-member SC bench observed that the state is expected to act responsibly as a fair litigant and not as a compulsive appellant/petitioner and directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman to determine whether the questions of law sought to be agitated before the court has already stand settled by superior court judgements.
Authored by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, a member of the bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, the judgement declared it imperative for the FBR chairman to consider constituting committees to vet each reference before filing it in a court of law.
To address the problem, according to the judgement, these committees should have the mandate to timely examine each case and function with the highest degree of independence. The committees may include a retired judge of the superior judiciary, an experienced tax practitioner and a senior serving or retired officer of the FBR with distinguished record and impeccable credentials.
The ruling came on an appeal of Assistant Commissioner, Inland Revenue Unit-III Zone-Cantt, Regional Tax Office, Rawalpindi, against the March 10, 2025 decision of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in favour of a private taxpayer.
The dispute originated when a notice was issued by the RTO, Rawalpindi, to one Umer Tariq Khan on Nov 15, 2023, alleging inadmissible input of Rs4 million tax. The order imposing the tax liability was passed on March 20, 2024, beyond the 120-day period stipulated under Section 11(5) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
The taxpayer challenged the order before the LHC, which while relying on an earlier precedent in Inland Revenue Commissioner vs. POF Welfare Packages SC judgements ruled that “time limit was mandatory”. The FBR then filed an appeal before the SC, which rejected it.
The SC judgement noted that government departments have tendency to file appeals/petitions mechanically, particularly when the outcome was foreseeable in light of settled law, but that had already been deprecated by the apex court in a number of judgements.

 

The bench made it clear that the courts possessed both constitutional authority and jurisprudential tools to address the problem of repeated appeals or petitions by government departments on settled questions of law. It explained the courts could dismiss such appeals/petitions in limine (rejecting pleas at a very initial stage even before issuing notice to respondents), sought identification of the officer for authorising the appeals/petitions, and even impose costs. With this explanation, the court emphasised on “internal accountability” by government departments and “careful legal scrutiny” before filing appeals/petitions.
“Had such scrutiny taken place before the filing of the instant petition, it would have been realised that the primary question of law sought to be agitated by the petitioners already stands authoritatively settled by a number of SC judgements,” the judgement explained.
‘Serious institutional harm’
When the government departments routinely file appeals/petitions, often up to the high courts and the SC on questions of law that have already been authoritatively settled, it noted, the practice results in “serious institutional harm” such as piling up of other cases with courts spending scarce judicial time revisiting the settled issues at the cost of undecided legal and constitutional questions, criminal appeals involving personal liberty, and civil disputes pending for years. This whole exercise undermines the constitutional mandate of speedy justice, it observed.
In the present petition, the department did not take the ground that the delay in passing of the ‘Order-in-Original’ was due to the frequent adjournments taken by the respondents. The department attempted to introduce this ground by filing an application wherein it was pleaded inter alia that the taxpayer had sought multiple adjournments from Nov 27, 2023 to Jan 4, 2024 in the proceedings before the assessment officer.
However, the department did not bother to file a copy of the order sheet of the proceedings before the assessment officer, the judgement regretted, adding this assertion of the department was belied before the high court.
When the state itself disregards binding precedents, it sends the wrong signals to subordinate courts, tribunals, and litigants. Such appeals/petitions result in unavoidable litigation costs, consumption of public funds for counsel, court fees and administrative processing, the judgement regretted.

AIN QANA: Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in this southern Lebanese village, violating a truce.—AFP

BEIRUT: One person was killed and eight others were injured on Monday as the Israeli military conducted strikes on multiple locations in southern Lebanon, targeting civilian areas in two villages.
Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon and has maintained troops in five areas it deems strategic.
Justifying the destruction, the Israeli military claimed that it was targeting “weapons storage facilities”. It further attempted to legitimise the bombing of residential neighbourhoods by reciting its standard claims, saying fighters hiding among “civilian infrastructure”.
The Israeli army had previously sent evacuation warnings for the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Ain Qana in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes on the targeted buildings in both towns.
Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others.
Another strike on Qleileh, elsewhere in the south, also wounded four people, according to the ministry.
The NNA reported Israeli strikes on vehicles near both areas, which came without warning. Lebanon has repeatedly protested Israeli strikes on Lebanon as violations of the ceasefire. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire.

Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir exchanges views with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.—PPI

ISLAMABAD: Weeks after signing a more than $4 billion arms deal, Pakistan’s armed forces and Libya’s eastern military on Monday pledged to continue their engagement and collaboration.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The ISPR said Field Marshal Khalifa Abu al-Qasim Haftar, commander in chief of the armed forces of eastern part of Libya, called on Field Marshal Asim Munir, chief of army staff and chief of defence forces, at the General Headquarters. Mr Haftar was accompanied by Osama Saad Hammad, prime minister of Libya’s eastern-based parallel government.
The statement said the discussions underscored the importance of continued engagement and collaboration between the two armed forces, with Field Marshal Munir reaffirming Pakistan’s support for peace, stability and institutional development in Libya.

Field Marshal Munir, Khalifa Haftar discuss regional security dynamics, military cooperation

Mr Haftar’s visit to Pakistan comes roughly six weeks after Islamabad and Libya’s eastern military finalised a major defence agreement during Field Marshal Munir’s visit to Benghazi in December. The deal, signed with Saddam Haftar, Khalifa Haftar’s son and deputy, is valued at over $4bn and is among Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons export agreements.
Under the agreement, Pakis­tan is to supply 16 JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter jets, co-developed with China, along with 12 Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft and other unspecified equipment for air, land and naval forces.
The deal also includes provisions for training, capacity building and potential joint manufacturing, with deliveries expected over the next two and a half years.
Analysts see the reciprocal visit as a signal of follow-through on the December pact for translating the agreement into concrete timelines for deliveries, training and broader military cooperation.
It also projects the relationship between the two sides as a long term strategic partnership rather than a one-off commercial transaction.
If fully implemented, the sale would represent the first export of JF-17 fighter jets to an Arab country, placing Pakistan more firmly within Libya’s eastern military orbit and signalling Islamabad’s intent to expand its defence footprint despite international sensitivities surrounding Libya’s prolonged conflict.

ISLAMABAD: As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the lower house of parliament exhibited rare unity on Monday in condemning the deadly terror attacks in Balochistan, with varying opinions on the way of tackling the menace, Def­e­nce Minister Khawaja Asif asserted that backwardness of any area was no justification to stand against the state.
Suggestions came from across the aisles that instead of a mere debate on the grave issue of terrorism, the government should take decisive action to eliminate terrorists with full force so that the life of a common man could be safeguarded.
However, when proceedings concluded, only 10 members were sitting in the house, indicating the seriousness of lawmakers in addressing one of the biggest challenges confronting Pakistan.
Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who was presiding over the NA session, earlier suspended its agenda and confined its proceedings to the issue of fresh terror attacks in Balochistan.
In his speech on the floor of the house, the defence minister said a total of 177 terrorists were killed within a few days following the deadly attacks in Balochistan that claimed the lives of 10 policemen, one Levies man, six FC personnel and as many as 33 civilians.
The defence minister warned that political polarisation and fragmented national narratives were undermining Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, cautioning that internal divisions only served the interests of militant groups and hostile foreign actors.
He said the country continued to pay a heavy price for past policy decisions, particularly those linked to regional conflicts, adding that the burden of those choices was being borne by civilians and security personnel rather than by those who had made the decisions decades ago.
He urged parliamentarians to demonstrate unity on matters of national security, saying a divided political discourse weakened public confidence and emboldened hostile forces.
Highlighting the human cost of terrorism, the defence minister said civilians in affected areas faced daily threats, while members of the armed forces continued to make sacrifices to safeguard national security.
He ruled out the narrative of disparity and backwardness in Balochistan, saying that banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which he described as India-sponsored, exploited this narrative to gain the sympathy of Baloch youth.
While presenting a comparison between the current situation and that at the time of independence in 1947, he said, “In 1947, there were only 114 schools in Balochistan, whereas today there are 1,596. There was no university in the province at that time, but now there are 12 universities.
Today, Balochistan has five medical colleges, 145 other colleges, 13 cadet colleges, 21 technical institutions, 13 hospitals, 18 teaching hospitals, 23 district headquarters hospitals, 756 basic health units, 841 dispensaries, four cardiac centres and 24 dialysis centres,” he added.
But Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai rejected the claims and figures presented by the defence minister, saying Mr Asif had no understanding of the situation in the province.
He said the unjust distribution of resources had created a sense of deprivation among the people, which fuelled terrorism. “The first right over resources rests with the people of the areas from where those resources are extracted. We can overcome terrorism in a short time by giving due rights to the people,” he added.
An ‘inhuman’ act
Mr Achakzai, however, condemned the attacks and said the killing of innocent labourers, teachers and people from other provinces in Balochistan was an inhuman act and could not be justified.
He urged the National Assembly speaker to hold a marathon session on terrorism lasting two days and to allow all members to speak on the issue.

 

Tracing the history of Balochistan since the British Raj, the opposition leader claimed that the Pashtun population was equal to the Baloch population in the province.
When Mr Achakzai held the country’s intelligence agencies responsible for failing to prevent the attacks, Speaker Sadiq commended the role of the security forces and intelligence agencies and urged the defence minister to provide details of how many terrorist attacks had been thwarted in the recent past.
A critical moment
Taking part in the debate, senior PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said political disagreements were a part of democratic life, but should not overshadow issues of terrorism, national integrity and security.
He cautioned against targeting national institutions for political gain, saying such actions damaged morale and could be exploited by hostile neighbours. He warned that political infighting and confrontational narratives were weakening the country at a critical moment.
Referring to the sacrifices of soldiers deployed along the borders and in terrorism-affected areas, the PPP lawmaker said any impression that their sacrifices were being undermined could have serious consequences for national resolve. He urged all political parties, including the opposition parties, to rise above partisan interests and present a united front on matters of national security.
The PPP leader called for comprehensive parliamentary engagement on security challenges, proposing that the House hold full debates and form committees to examine the situation and present concrete recommendations.
He stressed that Balochistan’s stability must remain a national priority and should be addressed through consensus rather than political confrontation.
The debate was held following the adoption of a motion to discuss the prevailing law and order situation in the country.
During their speeches, Mehmood Achakzai and Barrister Gohar demanded the release of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and called for him to be allowed to meet his doctors and family particularly in light of reports that he was suffering from ‘a serious medical condition’.

In absolute terms, export proceeds reached $3.061 billion in January, up from $2.951bn in the corresponding month of last year, reflecting an increase of 3.73 per cent, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said on Monday. On a month-on-month basis, export proceeds grew by 34.96pc in January.
Negative growth in exports has continued since August of the current fiscal year, barring July, when proceeds grew 16.43pc year on year. Export earnings posted negative growth, with proceeds declining by 20.41pc in December.

 

This follows a 14.54pc drop in November, 4.46pc in October, 3.88pc in September, and 12.49pc in August, reflecting persistent pressures on the country’s external trade performance. In the first seven months (July-January), export proceeds recorded negative growth of 7.09pc to $18.195bn compared with $19.583bn in the corresponding period last year.

Trade gap widens 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January FY26

The government has recently announced several measures, including a reduction in the energy rates and others, to minimise pressure on the country’s trade performance. Last week, the prime minister announced a decrease of Rs4.4 per unit in the electricity tariff for the industrial sector, in a bid to improve productivity and exports. He also announced a reduction in wheeling charges for industries, stating that “it will be less than Rs9 per unit.” He hoped that the move would help “industries sell their power to neighbouring industries”.
To provide additional relief, the premier said that “with the cooperation and support of Pakistan’s banks, we are announcing a reduction in the export refinance rate from earlier 7.5pc to 4.5pc”.
Currently, the exporters are grappling with subdued global markets and the high cost of doing business in the country. The textile exporters have already complained about contractions owing to the high cost of doing business. In FY25, export proceeds rose 4.67pc to $32.106bn against $30.675bn in the preceding year.
Trade deficit
According to the PBS data, imports fell 1.4apc to $5.786bn in January from $5.904bn over the corresponding month of last year. Month-on-month, imports decreased 4.85pc.
In the first seven months of 2025-26, the import bill grew by 9.42pc to $40.233bn, up from $36.771bn in the corresponding period last year. The import rose 6.57pc to $58.38bn in July-January FY25 from $54.78bn over the previous year.
The trade deficit narrowed 6.61pc to $2.725bn in January from $2.918bn over the corresponding month of last year. The trade deficit swelled 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January 2025-26, up from $17.188bn over the corresponding period last year. The trade deficit for FY25 widened by 9pc to $26.27bn, up from $24.11bn in the preceding year.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Uzbekistan resolved on Monday to expand the scope of their Preferential Trade Agreement to increase their trade beyond $2 billion in two years — from around $450 million last year —and to deepen cooperation in various economic fields.
At a meeting of the Pak-Uzbek Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), the two sides agreed to more than double the list of items for bilateral trade from 17 at present. The two sides had signed the agreement in March 2022 and it came into effect in 2023.
The 10th IGC on Trade, Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation was co-chaired by Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Industries and Production, and Uzbe­kistan’s Trade Minister Laziz Kudratov.
“The engagement enabled a comprehensive review of bilateral relations and established a forward-looking roadmap to strengthen joint efforts in major economic and social sectors”, a joint statement said.
The parties welcomed the progress on Phase II concessions of the Preferential Trade Agreement, the statement added.
The two sides “agreed to expedite institutional mechanisms to achieve the agreed target of $2bn in bilateral trade”.
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the steady progress achieved since the previous IGC session last year and reaffirmed their resolve to expand bilateral trade, investment, and economic engagement.
Emphasis was placed on trade facilitation, improved logistics, customs digitalisation, transit trade cooperation, development of regional trade corridors, and enhanced business-to-business engagement, supported by impro­ved visa facilitation for business communities.
The two sides also agreed to establish a joint working group on labour relations, tasked with addressing labour mobility, skills development, workplace safety, and practical considerations linked to employment visas.
Transport and communications
In transport and communications sector, the commission welcomed interest in launching direct air services, reviewed progress on regional railway and connectivity projects, and agreed to advance alternative transport corridors to improve regional trade and transit connectivity.
Cooperation in agriculture and food security featured prominently, with both sides welcoming progress on phytosanitary protocols facilitating the export of fruits from Uzbekistan to Pakistan.
The parties agreed to expand collaboration through additional protocols, joint working groups, and technical cooperation in plant protection, livestock development, and agricultural research, with a shared focus on food security and sustainable agricultural growth.
In higher education, science, and technology, the commission welcomed progress on academic and research partnerships between leading institutions of the two countries.
Both sides agreed to promote joint research, faculty and student exchanges, vocational and technical training, innovation, and capacity building, supported by newly signed agreements in scientific, technical, and innovation fields to strengthen long-term knowledge cooperation and human capital development.
Environmental and climate cooperation was recognised as a shared priority, with both sides agreeing to collaborate on climate resilience, protection of glacial ecosystems, sustainable water management, environmental governance, gender-inclusive climate action, and comm­unity-based adaptation approaches.

A highly-placed source confirmed to Dawn that the government has given approval to change the Punjab police high command.
The source said that a summary has been submitted to the prime minister for final approval.
It added that Anwar’s posting as the FIA DG was likely on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, reports suggested that the provincial government has prepared a panel of three candidates for the role of the Punjab police chief.
Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana, Punjab Counter Terrorism Department Additional Inspector General Wasim Sial and Special Branch Additional Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem are among those under consideration.
As per reports, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed is also in the race.
Dr Anwar was appointed Punjab IG during a large reshuffle by the Punjab caretaker government in January 2023. He was performing his duties with the National Highways and Motorway Police before being appointed Punjab’s police chief.
He was posted at the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department while he served as the Faisalabad senior superintendent of police (operations) and the Rawalpindi chief traffic officer.
Dr Anwar also performed duties in the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad. He also served as the district police officer in Okara and Sargodha as well as with the Telecommunications and Elite Police.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0222584175e4f29.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640/trump-announces-trade-deal-with-india-after-modi-call' target='_blank'><strong>Trump announces ‘trade deal’ with India after Modi call</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump announced a “trade deal” with India on Monday after speaking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying New Delhi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and may purchase it instead from Venezuela.
In a post on social media platform Truth Social, the US president said that he and the Indian premier spoke about “many things”, including trade and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
Trump added that “out of friendship and respect” for Modi, the US would lower its reciprocal tariff rate from 25 per cent to 18pc, while India would reduce tariffs on US goods to zero.
“He (Modi) agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,” Trump wrote, adding that this would “end the war” between Russia and Ukraine.







The US president, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends, and a powerful and respected leader of his country”, said that he agreed to “buy American” at a much higher level.
Trump added that India would buy, “over $500 billion of US energy, technology, agricultural, coal, and many other products”.
Later, Modi took to X to hail the discussion and express his happiness with the reduced tariffs.
“Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,” he wrote.
“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,” Modi said.
The Indian prime minister called Trump’s leadership is “vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity”, adding that New Delhi fully supports his efforts.
“I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” Modi said.







The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country’s leader Nicolas Maduro in a military operation in January.
Trump hit India, the world’s most populous nation, with 25pc reciprocal levies during his waves of “Liberation Day” tariffs last year. He then stacked another 25pc on top of that over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January 2025, but that has not stopped difficult trade negotiations over the past year.
Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022246219bb9e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970620/nuclear-talks-between-us-and-iran-slated-for-friday-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Nuclear talks between US and Iran slated for Friday: officials</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkiye, Iranian and US officials told Reuters on Monday, while a regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would participate.
US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.
Turkiye and other regional allies have sought de-escalation.
“Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt, as well as some other countries, will attend the Istanbul meeting. There will be bilateral, trilateral and other meetings,” the diplomat said.
Earlier today, the Iranian news agency Fars reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
“President Pezeshkian has ordered the initiation of nuclear negotiations with the United States,” the agency reported, citing an unnamed government source.
“The source said Iran and the US will hold talks strictly within the framework of the nuclear issue,” Fars added.
The report was also carried by the government newspaper Iran and the reformist daily Shargh.
Iran said it was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
“Several points have been addressed and we are examining and finalising the details of each stage in the diplomatic process, which we hope to conclude in the coming days,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said, without giving details on the content of any negotiations.
US Naval buildup near Iran
Tensions are running high amid a US naval buildup near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.
US President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast.
He said last week Iran was “seriously talking”, while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were underway.
Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.
Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.
Preparations for potential US-Iran talks
Baqaei said Tehran was considering “the various dimensions and aspects of the talks”, adding that “time is of the essence for Iran as it wants the lifting of unjust sanctions sooner”.
A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed to re-focus on diplomacy and possible talks this week, in a potential reprieve for potential US strikes.
Witkoff was expected to visit Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s military chief, two senior Israeli officials said separately on Monday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Turkiye last week and held further calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, he said on Telegram.
“President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” Araghchi told CNN on Sunday. “Of course, in return, we expect sanctions lifting. So, that deal is possible. Let’s not talk about impossible things.”
Baqaei said the rallying of neighbouring states around a diplomatic solution demonstrated a fear that any US attack would drag the region into conflict, echoing Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who warned on Sunday that a US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
‘Ball in Trump’s court’
The Iranian official said, “Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution”.
However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wanted US military assets moved away from Iran.
“Now the ball is in Trump’s court,” he said.
Satellite imagery shows repair work at Iranian sites
Tehran’s regional sway has been weakened by Israel’s attacks on Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In June last year, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings.
No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.
Washington-based think tank Institute for Science and International Security said satellite images from late January showed construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes”, as was seen ahead of last year’s US raid.
It could also signal the movement of assets from other facilities, it added.
Nuclear talks standoff
After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.
The UN nuclear watchdog has called on Iran repeatedly to say what happened to the highly enriched uranium stock since the June attacks.
Western countries fear Iran’s uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear programme is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses.
The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include the lifting of economic sanctions.
Ambassadors summoned
The supreme leader also likened the recent protests to a “coup” attempt.
Authorities have said the protests, which were sparked by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January, were “riots” inflamed by its arch foes, the United States and Israel.
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday, the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022158074131096.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970637/4-punjab-districts-allowed-to-manufacture-kite-flying-material-to-meet-basant-demand' target='_blank'><strong>4 Punjab districts allowed to manufacture kite-flying material to meet Basant demand</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday gave approval for the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material in four more districts of the province owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of these commodities ahead of the much-anticipated Basant festival in Lahore.
Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, albeit under tight curbs, following the Punjab government’s move to lift the ban on the festival after a hiatus of 18 years. Celebrations, however, will remain restricted to the provincial capital, which until now was the only district where the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material was allowed.
According to a February 1 letter by the Punjab Home Department to deputy commissioners (DC) concerned, the provincial cabinet has given approval for manufacturing the kite-flying material in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura as well.
The letter, seen by Dawn, said that the manufacturers should register themselves with the relevant DCs and through the Punjab government’s e-Biz digital portal and manufacture only “permissible kite-flying material”.
According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying on Basant whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
Under the code of conduct, the sizes for a 1.5 Tawa Gudda (width 40 inches, length 34 inches) and a 4.5 Guddi Kite (width 35 inches, length 30 inches) have been fixed, and the manufacturing or flying of kites larger than these will not be permitted at all.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
The Home Department’s letter also said that registered manufacturers in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura should only sell their products to sellers and traders registered with the Lahore DC “for use in the district of Lahore on Feb 6, 7 and 8, 2026 […] and not in any other district”.
“Sale of permissible kite-flying material by registered manufacturers of these four districts to any person or entity, other than the registered traders and sellers in Lahore, shall be strictly prohibited,” the letter read.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told Dawn that the provincial cabinet gave the approval in light of soaring prices and to bridge the demand-supply gap.
In addition to manufacturing, traders and sellers in Lahore had also been allowed to procure “permissible” kite flying material from other provinces, he further said, adding that material was already being procured from Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad.
The traders and sellers, however, are required to get permission from the Lahore DC to procure these items from other provinces.
In a post on X, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said every pinna (twine ball) would be QR-coded, “allowing it to be tracked from the manufacturer to the seller, and ultimately to the buyer”.
“All manufacturers are registered with the government and are fully compliant with approved safety regulations and specifications. In view of the increased demand for kites and strings, supplies from outside Punjab have been permitted strictly for products that meet the prescribed safety standards,” she said.







Ban around Lahore Airport
Qazi also told Dawn that the provincial cabinet had approved the exclusion of several areas, identified by the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), from kite-flying during Basant.
He added that the Lahore DC would notify Section 144 for those areas under Section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Act 2025.
The PAA had written a letter to the Punjab additional chief secretary last month, requesting that a complete ban on kite-flying be imposed in certain areas during Basant for the safety of flight operations.
The PAA had requested that the Nadrabad, Gulshan Ali Colony, Nishat, Bhatta Chowk and DHA’s R, S, P and Q blocks be declared no kite-flying zones, as they fall in the aircraft approach path at the Allama Iqbal International Airport.
Similarly, the PAA had sought a ban on kite-flying in Al-Faisal Town, Joray Pul, Canal Bank Road and Tajpura, located along the aircraft take-off path.
The PAA further requested, “Impose Section 144 in the identified areas to ban kite flying on the rooftops of houses, as kites and kite-strings can be ingested into aircraft engines or strike critical aircraft surfaces, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02210530dae9437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970635/fire-at-mobile-market-in-karachis-saddar-brought-under-control' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mobile market in Karachi’s Saddar brought under control</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A large fire that erupted on Monday evening at Saddar’s mobile market was brought under control, according to police and rescue officials.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the fire broke out on the 7th floor parking of the Al Najeeb mobile market at around 07:45pm.
He said the fire had erupted in a parking area located on the 7th floor of a high-rise building. He said that three cars were damaged in the blaze. He said the fire had been controlled while cooling work was ongoing.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that two persons were adversely affected due to suffocation, who were rescued and provided first medical aid on the spot.
He said the fire had erupted due to a short circuit failure in an electronic vehicle parked at the scene, which spread and engulfed two other vehicles.
He said four fire tenders and one snorkel managed to control the blaze, however, cooling work was ongoing.

 


Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the situation was “under control so far” and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) fire tenders and snorkels were present on the ground to tackle the situation.
“People are being evacuated as we speak. Will keep everyone posted,” he said.







He also urged the crowd to “stay back” so that rescue work could be carried out. He also shared a video of a large crowd surrounding a fire truck.







A statement by his office said he had taken immediate notice of the fire and directed the fire brigade to reach the site immediately.
“Ensure the safety of people’s lives and assets at any cost and speed up the rescue operation,” he directed. He also instructed officials to be on standby.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, meanwhile, contacted the Karachi mayor, commissioner and the inspector general, according to a statement issued by his office.
“Our first priority is to safely rescue the people stuck inside the building,” he directed. He also directed the police to manage the crowd at the scene so that the rescue operation would run smoothly.
He also directed that water be supplied to the fire brigade through the bowsers in a timely manner.
The incident comes a little over two weeks after a huge fire erupted at Karachi’s Gul Plaza, which claimed the lives of 73 people on January 17.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02213948303230f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970627/govt-rules-out-talks-with-terrorists-as-senate-condemns-spate-of-attacks-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out talks with terrorists as Senate condemns spate of attacks in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan, while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents.
Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists.
He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families.
Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.”
He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate.
He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts.
Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children.
He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express.
“These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”.
He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq.
He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added.
He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system.
Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board.
“We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted.
He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them.
Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.”
He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable.
Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party.
He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights.
He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it.
“You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked.
Senate passes resolution
Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law.
It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan.
The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts.
“The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said.
It also reaffirmed the Senate’s commitment to peace, development and political inclusion in Balochistan, recognising that “sustainable security is inseparable from socio-economic progress, good governance, and respect for constitutional rights”.
As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”. It said that said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the spate of attacks.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648653-pakistani-workers-set-to-regain-jobs-in-kuwait-labour-ties-strengthened' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani workers set to regain jobs in Kuwait; labour ties strengthened</strong></a><br><p>
