The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot.
Ahead of his departure to Qatar on Nov 3, a statement by the President’s Secretariat said he would hold “important meetings” with global and regional leaders and heads of major multilateral forums during the visit.
According to today’s statement by the Presidency, during his meeting with the Chinese vice president, Zardari recalled his recent visit to China, saying that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners”.
“He thanked China for its consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan through all challenges, reaffirming that friendship with China remains the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” the statement said.
 






The president also commended “China’s continued partnership in the successful implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has now entered its second phase of high-quality development,” it added.
For his part, the statement said, Han Zheng  appreciated “Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability” and reaffirmed the “enduring strength of the Pakistan-China friendship”.
The vice president also conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warm greetings.
He stressed that China would “continue to support Pakistan’s economic development under the second phase of CPEC, particularly in transport and infrastructure, information technology, agriculture, and vocational training”.
According to the statement, the two leaders “reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership based on mutual trust, respect, and a shared vision for regional peace and prosperity”.
“They also agreed to continue close cooperation on issues of mutual interest at regional and international fora,” the statement added.
President Zardari was accompanied by MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar during the meeting.</p><small>2025-11-05 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0514052796f08f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953291/ji-leadership-files-petition-in-shc-challenging-sindh-govts-e-challan-system' target='_blank'><strong>JI leadership files petition in SHC challenging Sindh govt’s e-challan system</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leadership on Wednesday filed a petition in the Sindh High Court (SHC) challenging the recently implemented e-challan system by the provincial government, alleging that the system, based on artificial intelligence (AI), imposes “exorbitant and discriminatory fines” on Karachi residents.
The Sindh government in June had decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. The system, officially inaugurated last month, has drawn a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
A petition was filed in SHC today by JI’s Karachi chief, Monem Zafar Khan, Leader of the Opposition, KMC Counsel, Saifuddin, and Member Provincial Assembly Sindh Muhammad Farooq. It was filed against the Province of Sindh through its Chief Secretary, Home Department, Inspector General of Police, Deputy Inspector General of Traffic Police, and Sindh’s Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Department.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, stated that the petitioners are “law-abiding citizens, taxpayers and residents of Karachi” aggrieved by the “arbitrary notification” imposing a new AI-based e-challan system with exorbitant and discriminatory fines introduced
by the Government of Sindh and the Traffic Department.
The petition said that the said system operates through CCTV and AI-enabled cameras which automatically detect alleged traffic violations and issue electronic challans to the registered owner of the vehicle, “regardless of the fact as to was actually driving at the time of the alleged violation and who is the actual owner”.
It stated that the “impugned notification” introducing the system has been
implemented without “first ensuring the necessary road infrastructure, vehicle
ownership verification mechanisms, installation of proper speed limit signboards, zebra crossings, and other essential traffic signs”.
Furthermore, according to the petition, “coercive measures such as a
drastic increase in fines, in some cases up to 1,000 per cent, blocking of computerised national identity cards (CNIC), suspension of driving licenses, and impounding of vehicles upon non-payment amount to punishment without due process of law”.
Per the notification, in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, a large number of vehicles continue to operate without a formal transfer of ownership, as the registration records still reflect the name of the original owner.
“This situation persists due to the cumbersome and corrupt procedures in the Excise and Taxation Department, which discourage timely transfer of ownership,” stated the petition.
The respondents, particularly the excise department, “have failed to introduce a simple and corruption-free mechanism for transfer of ownership, thereby compelling many citizens to use vehicles not yet transferred in their names,” it said, adding that the respondents are duty-bound to ensure an efficient and transparent system for ownership transfer.
Even on Sharea Faisal, one of the city’s key arterial roads, there are no traffic and speed limit signs, no zebra crossings and no other marks available, the petition stated.
Moreover, the petition highlighted that the roads in Karachi are in “deplorable condition” because of which “vehicles cannot be driven smoothly, forcing commuters to take alternative or even wrong routes”.
“In several areas, the traffic police themselves direct vehicles to drive on the wrong side due to ongoing construction works, for example, Numaish as well as along University Road where the [Red Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project] is under construction and is not expected to be completed for another three to four years,” it stated.
“Consequently, traffic remains congested day and night. Streetlights have been removed, diversions are inadequate, and barriers have been placed haphazardly, causing further inconvenience and accidents,” the petition mentioned.
The petition requested SHC to “suspend the operation, implementation, and enforcement” of the “impugned notification” and the challans, penalties and proceedings initiated against the citizens of Sindh, and restrain the respondents from issuing, processing, or recovering of any penalty until the final disposal of the petition.
It also requested the court to declare the implementation of the AI-based e-challan system without adequate infrastructure and ownership
verification safeguards as “illegal, arbitrary, and unconstitutional”.</p><small>2025-11-05 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0512084660ca325.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953104/seven-lean-years-pakistans-agricultural-crisis-revealed' target='_blank'><strong>Seven lean years? Pakistan’s agricultural crisis revealed</strong></a><br><p>And one day the king said,

“I dreamt of
seven fat cows eaten up by
seven skinny ones; and
seven green ears of grain and
seven others dry.


O chiefs!
Tell me the meaning of my dream
if you can interpret dreams.”

The Qur’an, 12:43
The king’s troubling dream foretold years of famine ahead. Today, Pakistan’s Seventh Agricultural Census, released in 2025, delivers a warning of its own. The data emerging from this comprehensive survey reveals structural fractures so deep they threaten the foundation of the country’s agricultural economy.
The census statistics are an early warning for the future of Pakistan’s food security and the livelihoods of nearly 40 per cent of its workforce. Analysis of the census data points to seven interconnected crises that could mark the beginning of Pakistan’s own “seven lean years”, threatening the foundation of the country’s rural economy.
Unlike the biblical king who had a Joseph to interpret his dream, Pakistan must decipher these agricultural omens for itself. And the message in the numbers is unmistakable: the coming years will test the resilience of a farming sector already stretched to its breaking point.
The shrinking farm: A crisis of fragmentation
The most alarming trend is that Pakistan’s farms are steadily shrinking. In Punjab’s most fertile districts, a farmer today might inherit three acres. His grandfather, two generations ago, may have worked the same land as a 12-acre plot. The subdivision among heirs with each generation has carved the family holding into pieces that can barely sustain them, let alone generate profit.
The census shows an overwhelming share of farms are now under five acres. This five-acre threshold is critical because it is roughly the minimum size needed for a farmer to afford or efficiently utilise a tractor and other modern machinery. This leaves a majority of farmers trapped, dependent on costly rentals or inefficient manual labour.
 

This alluvial diagram visualises Pakistan’s agrarian structure, revealing two core realities: a pronounced gender stratification in land tenure and an overwhelming concentration of farms (by acreage) in smaller landholding categories (<5 acres)

Gendered exclusion from agriculture
Perhaps the most significant finding is the near-total invisibility of women in formal agricultural ownership. The census examines “female-headed agricultural households”  — farms where a woman is the primary owner and decision-maker. These account for less than 1pc of all farms nationwide. The disparity is alarming given that women contribute nearly 68pc of all agricultural labour in Pakistan.
It also reveals a profound gap between law and reality. Both Islamic inheritance law and Pakistan’s legal framework formally entitle women to significant shares of land. However, a 2017-18 Demographic & Health Survey found that 9pc of Pakistani women did not inherit land or a house; only about 1pc inherited agricultural land.
The gap is not rooted in law but in culture. Survey data reveals that families resist giving women property primarily due to deep-seated social attitudes rather than legal barriers. A majority, precisely 58pc, believe that granting women property ownership would lead to family disputes, while 30pc argue that women do not need property in their own name.
Another 12pc question women’s mental capacity to manage property responsibly. Consequently, many daughters are coerced into relinquishing their inheritance rights to their brothers, leaving them without economic assets or financial independence.
The economic cost of this exclusion is staggering. If women controlled the land they are legally owed, they would hold roughly a quarter of Pakistan’s farmland. Instead, this massive economic potential remains untapped, perpetuating rural poverty. From a behavioural perspective, it is futile to expect earnest involvement from women in farming if there is no incentive to eventually inherit the land.
The high-risk gamble of crop specialisation
Pakistan’s agricultural geography shows a pattern of heavy concentration rather than true regional diversity. Wheat dominates across most districts, while rice, maize, and other crops appear only in smaller, localised pockets.
This lack of diversification may simplify production systems and reinforce comparative advantage in key areas, but it also magnifies vulnerability. Heavy dependence on a single crop leaves entire districts exposed to market volatility, climate shocks, and pest or disease outbreaks.
The lessons from abroad are stark. In the mid-20th century, Panama disease Race 1 wiped out the Gros Michel banana across the Americas, collapsing national export industries built on a single variety. Pakistan’s reliance on wheat carries a similar danger. A single well-placed shock could unravel both local economies and national food security when entire regions stake everything on one crop.
The seven deadly signs
The census data points to seven interconnected crises. These are not separate problems; they amplify each other.
A farmer on a tiny, fragmented plot (problem 1) cannot afford to dig a deeper well when groundwater vanishes (problem 2). This makes him more vulnerable to climate shocks (problem 3). To survive, he borrows from a middleman at exploitative rates (problem 7), trapping him in permanent debt. Seeing no future on the land, his sons migrate abroad (problem 5).


The fragmentation crisis: As noted, the 12-acre farm from 1970 has become a 3-acre plot today. It is too small to be profitable and too small to be mechanised effectively. In Punjab’s most fertile districts, the average farm size has dropped below five acres, barely enough to support a family, let alone invest in modern farming techniques.


The water scarcity shadow: Farmers rely on two main sources — ageing canals and tubewells that pump groundwater. But those groundwater tables are dropping. In parts of Punjab, farmers must now dig 90 feet for water that was at 30 feet two decades ago. Others, in rain-fed (or Barani) areas, are at the mercy of increasingly unpredictable monsoons.


 

This radial dendrogram provides a hierarchical classification of irrigation types, with embedded figures showing the acreage irrigated by each method. It confirms Pakistan’s reliance on outdated canal structures and unsustainable use of groundwater stores via tubewells



Climate vulnerability: Wheat, Pakistan’s staple, needs cool nights in March to mature properly. But as spring temperatures get warmer, yields are already falling. Farmers in rice zones face the opposite — floods one year, drought the next. Poorer farmers, particularly in the most overlooked districts of Pakistan, rely on sailaba irrigation (using seasonal flood waters), a practice that becomes catastrophic when floods are unpredictable. The same uncertainty haunts Barani farmers, who depend entirely on rainfall for irrigation; their numbers are vast, and their vulnerability just as deep.


Gender invisibility: As established, excluding women from owning farmland is not just a social issue; it is a massive economic inefficiency that prevents a sizable chunk of the country’s potential participants’ wealth from being economically active.


The youth exodus: Young people are leaving the farm in droves. In rural Punjab, this is driven by a powerful economic and cultural pressure called ‘dekha dekhi’ (literally ‘seeing and copying’), a form of social contagion. Since the British resettlement of those displaced by the Tarbela and Mangla dams, especially near Mirpur, overseas migration has been seen as a golden ticket. Remittances elevate families in local prestige, and for young men, masculinity itself is proven through the ability to succeed abroad rather than remain tied to the land. This convergence of economic pressures and cultural ideals drains agriculture of its most adaptable generation at the very moment it needs innovation most.

The technology gap: Small farm sizes constrain mechanisation. A wealthy farmer on 50 acres buys a tractor. A smallholder on three acres cannot. He must rent from the wealthy farmer, but he gets the machinery last, often after his crop is past its prime, reducing its quality and price. The structural concentration of machinery in the hands of large landholders, therefore, reinforces productivity gaps and locks small farmers into cycles of low output and high vulnerability.


The arthi trap: Finally, even if a farmer overcomes other obstacles, he faces the arthi (middleman). Nearly 90pc of Pakistan’s smallholders are vulnerable to this system, with 48pc depending on arthis specifically for crop inputs. The mechanics of this trap are simple but effective: Before planting, a small farmer with no cash goes to the arthi for a loan for seeds and fertiliser. The arthi provides them at inflated prices and, often, low quality. Come harvest, the farmer must sell his crop back to that same arthi, who now sets a lowball price. The farmer remains trapped in a permanent cycle of debt, unable to accumulate enough profit to break free. Notice how the middleman profits twice: once by overcharging for inputs, again by underpaying for output.
 


A path to seven years of plenty
However, the census does not just diagnose problems; it illuminates corresponding interventions that can turn Pakistan’s liabilities into strengths.


Land consolidation: Instead of families fighting over scraps, the government can encourage cooperative farming, where ten farmers pool their three-acre plots to farm as one thirty-acre bloc, sharing a tractor and splitting the profits. Policymakers can revisit Ayub Khan’s 1960s experiment in cooperative farming, learning from its failures of trust and elite capture. A modern version could take the form of farm shareholding, where landowners hold equity in pooled enterprises rather than working isolated plots. Similar models exist abroad: US farmland REITs (real estate investment trusts) let investors own shares in agricultural portfolios, while China’s land shareholding cooperatives allow farmers to convert land rights into equity and dividends. With legal safeguards and transparency, Pakistan could adapt such a model to attract investment and give smallholders real stakes in larger, more efficient farms.


Water security: Scarcity requires both efficiency and replenishment. Poor legislation has reduced groundwater to concerningly low levels, especially in the Punjab province. District-level water budgets should be aligned with crop patterns. Investment in canal rehabilitation, groundwater recharge zones, check dams, and rainwater harvesting structures can stabilise supplies. Regulation of tubewell extraction and pricing reforms for pumping electricity can reduce unsustainable groundwater depletion. This governance failure stands out when compared with neighbouring Punjab in India, where stronger regulation has prevented groundwater decline from reaching Pakistan’s current severity.


Climate resilience: Crop diversification is the best insurance against climate shocks. Incentives for mixed cropping, promotion of climate-smart varieties, and support for localised seed banks can reduce vulnerability. Extension services must provide farmers with real-time weather and pest advisories to adapt quickly to shifting conditions.


Gender inclusion: Women’s inheritance rights must be enforced through both legal mechanisms and social change campaigns. Publicly funded legal aid for women in property disputes, targeted credit programs for female farmers, and capacity-building initiatives can begin to correct the imbalance. Recognising women as farmers in their own right would unlock underutilised productive capacity.


Engaging the youth: Agriculture must become attractive for younger generations, but this requires addressing both the economic and cultural dimensions that make irregular migration seem more appealing than farming. An economic deterrence strategy could redirect the 1.8 to 2.3 million rupees that aspiring migrants typically invest in illegal journeys by offering equivalent microfinance schemes in high-migration districts such as Gujrat, Sialkot, and Gujranwala for local agricultural ventures, supported by entrepreneurship programs led by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority that highlight superior financial returns compared to deportation losses. At the same time, counter-narrative campaigns must tackle the dekha dekhi culture by mobilising Punjabi social media influencers to showcase successful young farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs. Vloggers like Asad, who document the harrowing reality of failed ‘dunki’ (irregular migration) journeys, represent the kind of voices that can reshape perceptions, while agritech incubators and vocational programs reframe farming as a high-tech, profitable sector that restores local prestige to agricultural innovation.


Technology access: Shared machinery pools and leasing centres can democratise mechanisation. Cooperative ownership of tractors, threshers, and storage facilities would reduce costs and improve the timing of operations. Subsidised credit and training in digital farming tools can ensure smallholders are not permanently locked out of technological gains.


Market reform: Breaking this monopoly requires farmer empowerment. This means creating digital platforms that show real-time market prices, building public storage so farmers are not forced to sell at harvest, and, crucially, providing farmers access to formal bank credit so they are no longer dependent on these predatory credit-based relationships.


The choice ahead
The “seven lean years” may not be a future prophecy but a current reality. Unlike the biblical king, however, Pakistan has more than a dream; it has data. The census is a detailed diagnosis.
The question is no longer if there is a crisis, but whether Pakistan will use this clear warning to build resilience, or wait for the dream to become an irreversible reality.

According to Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, Rano was transported to the capital on a Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft, which took off at 8:30am and landed at the Nur Khan Airbase a little after 11:30am.
From the Karachi Zoo, the bear was first taken to Faisal Base in a wooden brown crate on a cargo pickup truck, which Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) officials said she entered willingly and without having to be sedated.
“At just three calls, she walked from the sleeping area in her enclosure and into the crate,” said Sana Raja of the IWMB in a video. She added that Rano did not show any signs of distress and was also eating well.

Meanwhile, Mahar said that the team continuously monitored the bear on the flight, while Rano, despite the roar of the C-130 engine, caught up on lost sleep. “The technical staff at the Nur Khan Airbase helped with offloading Rano,” he added.
She was then taken to the IWMB bear rehabilitation facility, where she was given food and moved into a quarantine area. “Her stay here could last up to a month for examination and other protocols, after which she will be taken to a larger area,” said Anees, an official of the wildlife board, in a video shared by Mahar.
In the clip, a curious Rano could be seen sniffing her new, green home. Her otherwise heaving and panting body looked calm and at peace.
For years, Rano had languished at the Karachi Zoo, first inside a Victorian-era pit and then in a barren cage, a cell where she paced restlessly day and night on worn-out, hard flooring. Her situation had prompted animal rights activists to approach the Sindh High Court (SHC) seeking her relocation to the sanctuary in Islamabad.
Earlier this month, the SHC had ordered the bear’s relocation to the bear sanctuary. The court had also formed a committee to ensure her safe relocation, which included members of the IWMB, who had previously visited Karachi to train Rano.
Ray of hope
Mahera Omar, co-founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society, said that zoos were unable to meet the complex psychological and behavioural needs of wild animals, nor could they replicate the ecosystems that are their rightful home.
“Zoos must be phased out and the animals rehabilitated in appropriate species-specific sanctuaries,” Omar said.
“Animals are not meant for our entertainment,” said Omar. “They deserve to live freely in their own habitats across protected national parks.”
She added that Rano’s rescue offers a ray of hope for the many other innocent animals silently suffering in captivity across Pakistan.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir, who fought Rano’s case in the SHC, called her relocation a win for all animal rights activists and journalists who covered the bear’s suffering and raised their voices over the years. He also thanked the court for bringing Rano’s suffering to an end.
“Rano’s case is not an isolated one. Many animals have perished and continue to suffer at Karachi Zoo due to its inadequate facilities, apathetic and ill-trained staff,” he stressed. “Karachi Zoo was originally a botanical garden, and that is the purpose it should serve as opposed to being a living hell for animals.”
“For the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, the zoo is only a cash cow, and they justify its existence as a cheap source of entertainment for Karachiites. We need to educate our children about animals, not reduce them and their misery and suffering as a source of entertainment,” he added.
Years of neglect
In March 2017, the bear was transferred from a breeding farm and research centre to the Karachi Zoological Gardens under an animal exchange programme. Not having owned bears for 16 years, Rano was confined inside a Victorian-era pit that last housed Emma, a Balochistan black bear said to have gone mad in captivity.
Housed with Rano was an Asiatic black bear that died in 2020, leaving Rano in solitary confinement. That year, Rano’s suffering came to the fore after a video of her panting and leaning against the wall of the cement pit went viral on social media.
Subsequently, a petition was filed in the Sindh High Court seeking Rano’s transfer to a sanctuary. In response, however, the zoo officials shifted her to another cage, not any better than the previous one. Over the years, her condition worsened, reaching the point of psychosis.
Earlier this year, activists rallied for Rano’s freedom once again after the bear underwent treatment for a head injury — an old wound that seemed to have been infested by maggots due to lack of care.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC, through his counsel Nasir, stating that the bear was deprived of species-specific environmental enrichment, suitable climatic conditions and necessary medical care.
When a two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah took up the matter on Oct 14, the court ordered the brown bear be shifted from the Karachi zoo to the IWMB bear sanctuary within 48 hours.</p><small>2025-11-05 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05093027dc4d286.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953265/the-name-is-mamdani-democrat-zohran-elected-new-york-citys-first-muslim-mayor' target='_blank'><strong>‘The name is Mamdani’: Democrat Zohran elected New York City’s first Muslim mayor</strong></a><br><p>Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the country’s most visible Democratic figures.
According to CBS, Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127	
(7.1pc) for Curtis Sliwa.
Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party.
Trump had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“.
Mamdani was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018.
“Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said.

He also quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”
He also said that New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”.
He also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!”
 


Mamdani said he would put an end to the “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”.
“We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said.
Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”.
He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”.

He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying, “This power is yours. This city belongs to you.”
His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers.

Congratulations for Mamdani
Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said.
 






The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”.
 






US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”.
“Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” he said.
 






Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”.
“We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said.
 






Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US
Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States
Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival.
Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary.
A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign.
Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics.
Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office.
Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race.
 






Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor.
A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses.
Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message.
 






“We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.”
“You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said.
Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.
 






It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms.
The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.
Since US President Donald Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness.
Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot.
“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><small>2025-11-05 08:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0513104295e1686.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953295/trump-modi-speak-frequently-as-trade-talks-continue-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Modi speak frequently as trade talks continue: White House</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump speaks often with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and trade teams from both countries continue to hold talks, the White House said on Tuesday.
“The president and his trade team continue to be in very serious discussions with India,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
“I know the president has great respect for Prime Minister Modi, and they speak pretty frequently.”
 






Trump said last week in South Korea that he wanted to reach a trade deal with India — signalling a thaw in relations that soured to their lowest point in decades after the US president doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50 per cent as punishment for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Indian refiners cut Russian oil imports after Washington imposed sanctions last week on Moscow’s top two crude exporters, Rosneft and Lukoil.
Earlier this month, Trump claimed that Modi has agreed to cut Russian oil imports — something New Delhi has not commented on. A White House official said New Delhi had halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
 
 

On October 31, the US and India signed a 10-year defence framework agreement.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth termed the agreement a “cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence”. “We’re enhancing our coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation,” he had said.
Days before that, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Malaysia, where the two discussed bilateral ties as well as “regional and global issues”.</p><small>2025-11-05 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632196-islamabad-court-acquits-ptis-azam-swati-in-controversial-tweets-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court acquits PTI's Azam Swati in controversial tweets cases</strong></a><br><p>

According to an October 30 court order — a copy of which is available with Dawn — the AML leader’s name had been removed from the Exit Control List (ECL), following involvement in several May 9 cases. The court had directed relevant authorities to allow him to travel.
However, in a video message posted on the social media platform X, Rashid alleged that “Today, I was stopped from going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite having permission from LHC’s Rawalpindi bench under Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan.”
 






The AML leader recalled that the “court had directed relevant authorities — who were present in the hearing — to comply and strictly adhere to the directives, yet I have been told that I can not go.”
Rashied alleged that two airport officers told him he “could not go and refused to obey the court order.”
Rashid vowed to file for contempt of court against airport officials before Justice Khan, adding that “in a country, where even a high court order is not valid, you can only really look to God for help.”
In the Oct 30 court order, it was notified that “name of the petitioner (Sheikh Rashid) with the consent of concerned authorities has been removed from the exit control list (ECL).”
The court noted that, “Anti-terrorism court Rawalpindi had issued general order for impounding of passports relating to the persons facing trial under Section 28-A ATA, 1997, but at present respondents have no objection on going of the petitioner to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah.”
In January 2024, the AML leader was arrested after a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court rejected his bail in a case pertaining to violence in the country on May 9.
Previously, Rashid was arrested in 2023 by the Punjab police amid the state’s crackdown on the PTI and its supporters following incidents of vandalism on May 9 — when party chairman Imran Khan was first arrested from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p><small>2025-11-05 07:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/050811356a1f4a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953203/ready-to-face-all-threats-in-the-region-says-chief-of-staff' target='_blank'><strong>Ready to face all threats in the region, says chief of staff</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakistan Navy is always prepared and ready against all threats in the region, Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz said on Tuesday .
“We are always keeping an eye on whatever is happening around us. We are always monitoring what is happening. This is an ongoing thing, our monitoring and our readiness,” he told the media on the second day of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference 2025 (PIMEC-25) at the Expo Centre.
He said that Pakistan would soon induct new submarines into its fleet, which will significantly contribute to national and maritime security.
“Pakistan Navy’s  role in the region is to ensure maritime security and the free flow of  trade in the region. The new submarines will significantly contribute to  that in the coming days,” he said.

Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz pins hopes on Gwadar port

Talking about PIMEC, he termed it an effort to provide stimulus to Pakistan’s maritime sector and blue economy.
The vice admiral said that there were some maritime industries that were “less visible and less known”.
He also stressed the need for efficient port operations and hoped to see Gwadar Port fully functional soon.
“Your turnaround port time, and the size of ships that can dock there, matters, like our deep water terminal in Karachi where we can dock big ships. Gwadar is at such a strategic location that it will help significantly in transshipment and seaborne trade. A fully functional Gwadar Port will present us with huge economic opportunities in the future,” he said.
The Karachi Shipyard also has a huge presence at PIMEC-25. While speaking about it, the Vice Admiral reminded that it was built ages ago and, therefore, has a limit to the kind of ships being built there.
“The world has moved on. Shipyards in the world today are huge. We are also trying to build a shipyard on those lines in Gwadar. We hope to progress there. There was also a discussion about building a shipyard in Port Qasim. So yes, I think we need to have more shipyards. And the sooner the better,” he said.

A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington’s definition of maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge.”
Saudi Arabia made a direct appeal earlier this year to US President Donald Trump and has long been interested in Lockheed Martin’s fighter, one of the people and a US official said. The Pentagon is now weighing a potential sale of 48 of the advanced aircraft, the US official and the person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The size of the request and its status have not been previously reported.
The US official and a second US official, who acknowledged the weapons deal was moving through the system, said no final decision has been made and several more steps are needed before the ultimate nod, including further approvals at the Cabinet level, sign-off from Trump and notification of Congress.
The Pentagon’s policy department worked on the potential transaction for months, and the case has now progressed to the secretary level within the Defense Department, according to one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Pentagon, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said military sales are government-to-government transactions and the matter is best addressed by Washington.
Washington weighs weapons sales to the Middle East in a way that ensures Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge”. This guarantees that Israel gets more advanced US weapons than regional Arab states.
The F-35, built with stealth technology that allows it to evade enemy detection, is considered the world’s most advanced fighter jet. Israel has operated the aircraft for nearly a decade, building multiple squadrons, and remains the only Middle Eastern country to possess the weapons system.
Saudi Arabia, the largest customer for US arms, has sought the fighter for years as it looks to modernise its air force and counter regional threats, particularly from Iran. The kingdom’s renewed push for what would constitute two squadrons comes as the Trump administration has signalled openness to deepening defence cooperation with Riyadh.
The Saudi Air Force flies a mix of fighter aircraft, including Boeing F-15s, European Tornados and Typhoons.
The F-35 issue has also been intertwined with broader diplomatic efforts. The Biden administration previously explored providing F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a comprehensive deal that would have included Riyadh normalising relations with Israel, though those efforts ultimately stalled.
Trump has made arms sales to Saudi Arabia a priority since returning to office.
In May, the United States agreed to sell the kingdom an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, which the White House called “the largest defence cooperation agreement” Washington has ever done.
Congressional scrutiny could also pose challenges to any F-35 sale. Lawmakers previously questioned arms deals with Riyadh following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some members of Congress remain wary of deepening military cooperation with the kingdom.
The potential sale also comes as Saudi Arabia pursues ambitious economic and military modernisation plans under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 agenda. The kingdom has sought to diversify its defence partnerships in recent years while maintaining its decades-long security relationship with Washington.</p><small>2025-11-05 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051123069c239b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953286/man-arrested-for-allegedly-firing-on-citizens-protesting-dumper-truck-death-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for allegedly firing on citizens protesting dumper truck death in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police said on Wednesday that a man had been arrested for allegedly firing on citizens who had torched a heavy vehicle that had struck a young man and injured his wife a day earlier.
Angered citizens on Tuesday had set a dumper truck on fire in the city’s Garden area after it crashed into a couple on a motorcycle, killing 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and injuring his wife Misbah. A case was also registered against Liaquat Mehsud, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters at the scene.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza on Wednesday said that police had arrested one suspect, identified as one of Mehsud’s gunmen, on charges of firing on the protesters.
The weapon used in the incident was also recovered, he said in a statement.
“Raids are being conducted to arrest the president of the dumpers association, Liaquat Mehsud,” he added.
Ex-MQM-P lawmaker booked under Peca for threatening Mehsud
Separately, Garden police also registered a first information report (FIR) against Kamran Farooqi, a former MPA of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), for allegedly threatening Mehsud.
The case was registered on behalf of the state through a police officer, and invoked the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), as well as Section 506-B (criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, complainant Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Rao Muhammad Shahrukh said he was present at his office on November 4, when he came across a video on social media at 6pm.
 
 

In the video, as per the ASI, a man identified as Kamran Farooqi was seen saying: “This wretched person, was fortunate today that he went away a few moments earlier, otherwise he would have been burned along with his vehicle. This is a public reaction.”
The video was accompanied by similar text stating that Mehsud was “fortunate” to have escaped,  the complainant added.
The complainant recalled that a dumper truck had killed Shahzeb on Nishtar Road in the Ramswami area and injured his wife Misbah yesterday. After that incident, the people had set the dumper ablaze. Subsequently, Mehsud, along with his gunmen and others, had arrived at the spot.
ASI Shahrukh noted that the police had already registered two separate cases about the incident at the Garden police station. He contended that Farooqi spread “mischief” on social media and threatened the dumper association’s head. Therefore, the ex-lawmaker had committed cognisable crimes under Peca and the PPC, the officer asserted.</p><small>2025-11-05 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051130166bd372c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953287/fawad-claims-efforts-for-release-of-political-prisoners-including-imran-to-bear-fruit-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Fawad claims efforts for release of political prisoners, including Imran, to bear fruit soon</strong></a><br><p>Former minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed on Wednesday that the “impacts” of the efforts of a trio — comprising him and other ex-PTI leaders — for political stability in the country and the release of political prisoners, including PTI founder Imran Khan, would start bearing fruit in the next 10 to 15 days.
Fawad, along with fellow former PTI leaders  Mehmood Moulvi and Imran Ismail, has been insisting on talks between the government and the PTI, in what they say is an effort to bring the political temperature down and pave the way for Imran’s release, who has been in jail since 2023.
“I am very pleased that the efforts for political stability and to secure the release of political prisoners, including Imran, have resulted in significant initial successes, and their impact will start becoming evident in the next 10 to 15 days,” Fawad posted on social media platform X.
 






He reiterated that himself, Moulvi and Ismail were making these efforts for “political stability in Pakistan”, expressing the optimism that differences and distances would soon diminish in the political landscape.
“It is important to abate political hostilities for Pakistan’s political stability and […] long-term development,” Fawad said.
The statement came hours after a late-night post on Imran’s X account quoted him as saying that he would “neither hold talks with the government nor with the establishment”.
While it remains unclear that who runs Imran’s social media accounts with him being in jail, posts on his X accounts frequently carry statements that are described as his messages from jail.
In the post, Imran said it was futile to hold talks and any decisions regarding negotiations would be taken by Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Raja Nasir Abbas, who are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, along with the PTI.
The post also quoted Imran as saying that he had complete trust in PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who has been criticised by Fawad in recent days.
Political outreach campaign
Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore last week. The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that had no political discussion with his client.
Qureshi is among several PTI leaders who were sent to prison in cases pertaining to May 9, 2023 protest that erupted over Imran’s arrest the same day. A crackdown on the party was launched after the violent protests, during which several public properties and military installations were vandalised.
The former foreign minister was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute from jail for medical treatment, where the three former PTI leaders   visited him.
 
 

“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar later said, adding that by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi.
However, the former PTI leaders, particularly Fawad and Ismail, have been insisting that Qureshi had agreed with them that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. The also maintain that they met another jailed PYI leader Ejaz Chaudhry in this regard.
After their visit to the hospital, Raja also reportedly called on Qureshi, with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow.
On Sunday, Fawad had doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue.
He also claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders.
“If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to PTI leaders such as Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid.
He also shared the trio’s plans to approach the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman, as well as some senior ministers, and ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions.
The ex-PTI leaders have also dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051119207f4a0f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953285/19-year-old-ac-technician-injured-in-gas-leak-blast-at-supreme-court-canteen-succumbs-to-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>19-year-old AC technician injured in gas leak blast at Supreme Court canteen succumbs to injuries</strong></a><br><p>One of the 13 people injured in a gas blast at the Supreme Court’s canteen a day earlier succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, according to hospital officials.
Dr Abdul Khaliq, the head of the Burn Care Centre at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, said that 19-year-old Asad Muneeb, who was a air conditioner technician (AC), did not survive.
He said that the victim had sustained burn injuries on 80 per cent of his body.
The doctor also said that another person injured in the incident had been discharged.
“Out of the 11 remaining patients, four are critical. Five of them will have plastic and skin surgeries within the next two weeks,” he said.
Talking about the gas blast, he said that in such cases hot air enters the lungs, severely damaging them in the process. He said that chemicals were also released in such a situation, which could further exacerbate one’s injuries.
“Our plastic surgery team for burn injuries is doing their best,“ he said.
As many as 13 people were burnt, two of them seriously, in a gas explosion in the apex court’s canteen on Tuesday. The incident took place in the canteen located in the basement of the court building at around 10:55am.
Islamabad Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said there was a massive gas leakage and smell in the basement while air conditioners installed in the canteen were also not working properly. He said the blast happened when technicians were busy with repair work, adding that majority of the injured were technicians.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05111524898da38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953284/china-suspends-some-us-tariffs-yet-soybean-buyers-still-face-high-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>China suspends some US tariffs, yet soybean buyers still face high tariffs</strong></a><br><p>China will suspend for one year the 24 per cent additional tariffs it imposed on US goods in April, while maintaining the 10pc levies also introduced in response to US President Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ duties, its cabinet confirmed on Wednesday.
The State Council’s tariff commission also announced it would remove the duties of up to 15pc it imposed on certain US agricultural goods from November 10, referring to a release from March detailing the products the world’s top agricultural buyer would begin taxing on import.
But the cut still leaves Chinese buyers of soybeans facing tariffs of 13pc, including a preexisting 3pc base tariff. Traders say that makes US shipments still too expensive for commercial buyers compared to Brazilian alternatives.
Before Trump took office in 2017 and the first US-China trade war began, soybeans were by far the top US export to China, with the world’s biggest agricultural buyer purchasing $13.8 billion worth of the staple in 2016.
But China has largely held off on buying US crops this year, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost exports. In 2024, China bought roughly 20pc of its soybeans from the United States, down from 41pc in 2016, customs data shows.
 
 

Investors on both sides of the Pacific breathed a sigh of relief last week when Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, easing fears that the world’s two largest economies might abandon talks aimed at resolving a tariff war that has disrupted global supply chains.
While Trump and the White House were quick to publish their take on the meeting, the Chinese side did not immediately move to provide a detailed summary of what it had agreed.
China’s state-owned COFCO bought three US soybean cargoes the day before the summit, an act analysts attributed to a goodwill gesture signalling Beijing’s desire to avoid a destabilising escalation in trade tensions.
Some market participants expressed doubt that the soybean trade would return to normal anytime soon.
“We don’t expect any demand from China to return to the US market with this change,” said one trader at an international trading company. “Brazil is cheaper than US and even non-Chinese buyers are taking Brazilian cargoes.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05083126d33d024.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953215/police-station-checkpost-attacked-in-kachhi-and-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Police station, checkpost attacked in Kachhi and Quetta</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Unknown armed men attacked and set fire to a police station in Kachhi district, while a check post was targeted with hand grenades in the Western Bypass area of the provincial capital, Quetta, on Tuesday evening.
Officials said nearly two dozen armed men, carrying heavy weapons, attacked the Khattan Police Station in Kachhi district. The station had been recently established in a building of the Livestock Department and handed to the police after the merger of levies personnel into police.
The assailants entered the two-room police station, burning official records and furniture. They also took away two rifles, including an SMG and a G-3, along with a mobile phone and a private motorcycle before fleeing.
“Owing to the large number of assailants, the former levies personnel, who were in a nearby private house, could not effectively respond,” a senior official said, adding that no loss of life or injury was reported.
Local police and security forces reached the site soon after receiving information about the incident and launched a joint search operation to trace the attackers. The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Sibi Range is further investigating the case.
Check post attacked 
Meanwhile, unidentified men attacked a security forces check post in Western Bypass area of Quetta with hand grenades. “The motorcyclists fired two grenades at the post, which exploded close by but caused no casualties,” police officials said.
Security personnel deployed at the post retaliated with fire; however, the attackers managed to escape after hurling the grenades. Security forces later launched a search operation in the area.

The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government but around 2,000 have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
According to the initiative Airbridge Kabul, refugees have been sent a letter offering them money and other support in return for exiting the resettlement programme.
In the case of a single woman, the payments would be an initial 1,500 euros (about $1,700) in Pakistan and a further 5,000 euro payment if she travels to Afghanistan or a third country.
A spokeswoman for the interior ministry said that  “there are offers within the framework of a voluntary return programme to Afghanistan or departure to another third country”.

Single woman may get 1,500 euros in Pakistan and a further 5,000 euros if she travels to  Afghanistan or a third country

The German scheme was aimed at Afghans who had worked with German forces in Afghanistan or who were deemed at particular risk from the Taliban, for example journalists, lawyers and human rights activists.
Eva Beyer from Airbridge Kabul said she was not aware of any refugees in the scheme who planned to accept the German government’s latest offer and that many had reacted with shock and outrage.
“I’ve been trembling all over and can’t stop crying,” read one message from a refugee which Beyer shared with this news agency.  “I don’t want money or bread, I just want to live in safety.”
Pakistani authorities have in recent months intensified a crackdown on Afghans living in the country without residency.
Over the summer, more than 200 Afghans who were enrolled in the German programme were deported to Afghanistan.
In September, a German foreign ministry spokeswoman said that  “an understanding” had been reached with Pakistan that no further arrests or deportations of those in the programme would take place until the end of the year.
However, according to Airbridge Kabul, there were 17 arrests in late October and the situation for Afghans in Pakistan was aggravated by the military clashes between the two countries last month.
The initiative says that the latest letter to the refugees admits that “the procedures in Pakistan must be fully completed by the end of 2025” but adds that  “unfortunately, it cannot be guaranteed that all procedures will be completed in time”.
Several groups of Afghans in the resettlement programme have been able to come to Germany after taking the government to court, with a group of 14 arriving last Thursday.

• Rabbani says recalling the financial devolution against scheme of participatory federalism
• PTI leader calls for consensus before any constitutional tweaks, says it’s akin to abolishing Constitution; JI chief warns against its ramifications for judiciary
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: After the government approached the PPP to seek its support for the 27th Ame­ndment, the key party leaders have come out against the proposed constitutional tweaks that are said to be an attempt to roll back the landmark 18th Amendment that ensured provincial autonomy.
The opposition to the proposal came as the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) is set to meet on November 6 to review the government proposal after a PML-N delegation led by the prime minister had sought the party’s support for the proposed 27th Amendment.
 
 

The early indications suggest that backing the move may not be easy for the party, as dissenting voices have already begun to surface from within its own ranks. Senator Raza Rabbani feared that the wrapping up of the 18th Amendment would lead to extraconstitutional activities in the country.
In a statement, Senator Rabbani said the proposed constitutional amen­dments of the government, with reference to provincial autonomy, amount to a rollback of the 18th Amendment.
“In the brittle internal political situation, playing with provincial autonomy will cast deep shadows over the federation,” he said, adding, “The 18th Amendment disarmed the extreme nationalists of a political discourse; such an amendment will lend vigour to their extra-constitutional activities.”
Mr Rabbani said that revisiting devolved ministries will be a financial burden on the federal government. Recalling the financial devolution, he said, will be against the scheme of participatory federalism.
“If the federal government is unable to manage its finances, then let the provinces collect all the taxes and look after federal expenditures through the Council of Common Interests,” he added.
Nisar Khuhro, the president of the PPP’s Sindh chapter, made it clear that “the party firmly opposes any attempt to roll back the 18th Consti­tutional Amendment”.
“Unilateral changes to the Consti­tution would not be acceptable,” he said while addressing a press conference in Karachi. “The 18th Amendment was passed unanimously through consensus among all political parties after deliberations by a national committee — a consensus that even dictators could not undo. The PPP is categorically against any rollback of the 18th Amendment.”
Mr Khuhro said the matter would be taken up in detail at the PPP’s CEC meeting, where the party would decide its final position on the issue. Meanwhile, PTI leaders alleged that the details of the 27th Amendment, shared by the PPP chairman, were similar to abolishing the Constitution.
“Although we will give a formal response…after meeting founding chairman Imran Khan and discussing it in the meeting of the political committee, I suggest the amendment should be made with consensus in light of the current situation in Pakistan,” Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told reporters outside Adiala.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman criticising the proposed amendment said these moves were aimed at establishing governmental control over the judiciary.
Addressing a press conference, he said that the 26th Constitutional Amen­­dment gave a serious blow to the judiciary, whereas the proposed 27th Amendment was aimed at establishing the executive’s dominance over courts.

The document from state-owned Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) to the country’s Ministry of Energy dated Oct 22 said 11 cargoes planned for 2026 and 10 for 2027 would be cancelled at the request of gas distributor Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL).
Only the planned January shipment in both years, and the December shipment in 2027, would be retained to meet peak winter demand, according to the document, reviewed by Reuters.
Two sources familiar with the matter in Pakistan said that Eni had agreed to the move under the contract’s flexibility provisions. LNG is in strong demand globally, and suppliers typically stand to earn more by selling cargoes in the spot market than under long-term contracts.

Seeks to renegotiate Qatar supplies amid demand slump

Eni declined to comment. PLL, SNGPL, and Pakistan’s petroleum ministry did not reply to requests for comment.
Supplies from Qatar
PLL’s move marks one of Pakistan’s most significant steps yet to rein in LNG purchases as rising renewable generation and lower industrial demand leave it with surplus imported gas.
Eni signed a long-term LNG supply deal with PLL in 2017, committing to deliver one cargo per month until 2032, with the option to divert shipments to other destinations.
The first source, and a third, said that Pakistan was also in talks with Qatar about gas supplies from the Gulf state, with options including deferring some cargoes or reselling them under existing contract clauses. Last week a technical team visited Karachi to schedule the cargoes. The talks are ongoing and no decision has been reached, the first and third sources said.
QatarEnergy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Demand slump
Pakistan’s long-term LNG supply deals with Qatar and Eni together cover around 120 cargoes a year, including on average nine a month from two Qatari contracts and one from Eni.
But Pakistan’s LNG imports have fallen sharply this year as demand from power producers dropped amid higher solar and hydropower output.
Lower gas use by power plants and industrial units generating their own electricity have added to the surplus, leaving the system significantly oversupplied for the first time in years.
The glut has forced Pakistan to sell gas at steep discounts, curb local production, and consider offshore storage or reselling excess cargoes, according to government presentations reviewed by Reuters.
Eni’s last delivered cargo to Pakistan was received at the GasPort terminal on January 3, according to Kpler data. The first source, and a fourth one, said Pakistan had also agreed a deal with Eni not to receive any further cargoes in 2025.
Eni shipped out 12 cargoes to Pakistan in 2024.

• Discrepancy arises from reliance on administrative boundaries over population density, settlement patterns
ISLAMABAD: An analysis of a World Bank policy research working paper reveals that Pakistan’s true level of urbanisation is close to 88 per cent, based on satellite imagery and the Degree of Urbanisation methodology.
According to the working paper titled “When Does a Village Become a Town?: Revisiting Pakistan’s Urbanisation Using Satellite Data”, the substantial discrepancy arises from Pakistan’s reliance on administrative boundaries that fail to reflect actual population density or settlement patterns.
The analysis finds that Pakistan’s urban population is nearly twice the size reported in official statistics, as the administrative definition accounts only for the largest cities. Based on the DoU classification, 88pc of the population lives in an area with urban characteristics – 46pc in high-density cities and about 42pc in moderately dense urban centres.
These figures contrast sharply with the 39pc urban population reported in official data, revealing a major gap between politically defined and technically measured classifications.
The findings indicate that secondary cities and peri-urban areas — rather than megacities — are the primary drivers of recent urban expansion and are systematically overlooked in official classifications. This discrepancy between functional and administrative classifications has significant fiscal and planning implications.
 
 

Misclassified areas reduce property tax revenues and undermine the planning and delivery of essential public services. Moreover, misclassification distorts spatial socioeconomic indicators, masking the true extent of urban-rural disparities and complicating the design of effective, evidence-based public policy, according to the research paper produced by the World Bank’s Office of the Poverty and Equity Global Department.
The last time Pakistan’s official classification of urban areas reflected on-the-ground realities was in 1972. Before then, urban classification was based on objective indicators such as population count, infrastructure, and public service provision. However, after 1972, the responsibility shifted to provincial and municipal committees, which have no formal obligation to consider population concentration or objective metrics when defining urban areas – nor are they required to periodically revise urban boundaries.
The study shows that while official statistics suggest 39pc of Pakistan’s population is urban, this figure rises to 88pc when population density and concentration are considered. The official definition captures only the largest urban centres and fails to recognise the urban character of growing peri-urban areas that now host nearly half the population.
Additionally, the paper discussed how mirroring the urban expansion of Pakistan with the development of “megacities” overlooks the significant urbanisation occurring in growing peri-urban areas. While the expansion of cities like Lahore and Karachi is a notable indicator of the country’s increasing urbanisation, a large part of the urban population growth occurs in many intermediate and small urban centres.
The study uses the Degree of Urbanisation method, which relies on satellite data to assess population density, providing a more accurate and globally comparable view of urbanisation beyond administrative boundaries.
Across all provinces, the divergence between the official urban classification and the DoU persists, with official statistics consistently
Official data underrepresents urbanisation, with Islamabad showing only 47pc urban population compared to 90pc under the DoU, while figures in Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh are more closely aligned.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the DoU estimates the urban population at nearly three times the official 15pc, while Islamabad is mostly dense urban, and other provinces show mixed suburban and peri-urban growth.  The report concludes that Pakistan’s urban landscape has transformed dramatically over the past two decades. Since the early 2000s, a growing share of the rural population has shifted away from agriculture, transforming previously rural settlements into new and vibrant urban centres.

Under the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), publication of the IMF-prepared GCD report and a subsequent action plan to address governance weaknesses across federal and provincial tiers is a key structural benchmark.
The deadline, initially end-July and then reset to end-August and end-October 2025, remains unmet owing mainly to technical and factual disagreements between Pakistani authorities and the IMF team.
“We have reaffirmed the structural benchmark and, with mutual understan­ding with the IMF, have committed to publish the report before the [IMF exe­­­c­utive] board meeting” later this mo­nth or early next month, an official said.

Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment is a structural benchmark under $7bn bailout package

He said it was a very comprehensive exercise conducted by the technical and legal teams of the IMF in consultation with other global organisations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Drafts were exchanged repeatedly with Pakistani counterparts — including anti-corruption bodies, the superior judiciary, investigation agencies and the finance and law ministries — to secure “the best outcome” from international expertise covering more than 100 rules, the official added.
He said there had been serious disagreements on the interpretation of rules in the local and internal context, “for the best advice and implementation plan”. The official claimed the disagreement phase was now over and a final draft had been shared with IMF headquarters in Washington for a final review before publication.
The two sides are believed to have discussed reducing the time gap betw­een the publication of the GCD Asses­sment Report and a resultant governance action plan based on its recommendations for reform measures to address critical governance vulnerabilities.
Earlier, the GCD report was set for publication in July and the action plan rollout was scheduled for a gap of three months by the end of October. The latter may now be rolled out before December to become subject for the next biannual review.
There are compliance gaps around asset declarations by public servants. While the overarching civil servants’ law has been amended to mandate electronic filing by Grade-17 and above officials, including beneficially owned assets and those of family members, for access by relevant institutions, tax authorities and banks, implementation remains uneven.
An IMF scoping mission had visited Pakistan early this year and held meetings at the Supreme Court, the Law and Justice Division, the Auditor General for Pakistan, parliamentarians, the National Accountability Bureau, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the State Bank of Pakistan.
It produced a comprehensive report identifying gaps and weaknesses in public finance management, FBR’s tax system, and the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues’ efforts to identify loopholes.
Under the existing governance mechanism, the majority of government officers have not been disclosing assets of their own and those of other family members to the tax authorities or the Establishment Division, and there was an insufficient institutional mechanism for accountability.
On top of that, many institutions, including regulatory bodies, have exemptions from such requirements of scrutiny and disclosures. No wonder there have been widespread reports of corruption and corrupt practices across the bureaucratic and political landscape, and Pakistan has been ranking high on the various international corruption perception indexes.
 
 

The IMF has been pressing for data-based red flags, due diligence, safeguard mechanisms and guidelines against corruption and misuse of public offices, resulting in sub-optimal decision-making and compromising the country’s business and growth potential. The Paris-based FATF had also identified a series of weaknesses and made recommendations for course correction.
Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the second review of $7bn bailout package and the first review of $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Fund (RSF) on Oct 14.
Under the agreement, Pakistan will get $1bn disbursement under the EFF and $200m under RSF upon approval of the IMF executive board. The board meeting has not been announced yet, but authorities suggest this would be convened any time after Nov 15.

The PPP and PML-N, in separate meetings, had earlier decided to part ways with the coalition government and sought approval from their respe­ctive leaderships to withdraw ahead of the upcoming general elections.
After several rounds of deliberations and shifting positions, the PML-N eventually announced it would support the PPP in forming its own government but would not accept any share in the new set-up.
Meanwhile, a series of meetings of PPP legislators and senior leaders were held in Karachi and Islamabad to chalk out a strategy.

PPP law minister defends use of official perks, says they can be availed until vote of confidence

During one such meeting, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari categorically declared that his party would oust the incumbent AJK premier and replace him with a loyalist from within the party.
Under Article 18 of the AJK Constitution, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence against the prime minister must be moved by at least 14 members — constituting 25 per cent of the total strength of the assembly — and must include the name of the proposed successor.
Subsequently, at least 10 members from the so-called ‘forward bloc’ of PTI dissidents also announced their support for the PPP’s planned move, enabling the party to meet the minimum requirement of 27 votes needed to topple the government.
Nevertheless, the PPP leadership remained insistent on securing PML-N’s backing to ensure a comfortable and unchallenged majority. Following the understanding between the two parties, a draft of the no-confidence motion against Mr Haq was prepared and signed by over 14 legislators, including two from the PML-N.
Yet, nearly three weeks later, the PPP has failed to finalise the name of its candidate for the premiership, leaving the move hanging in the balance.
‘Forward bloc’ irony
Ironically, despite publicly announcing their intent to unseat the prime minister, none of the PPP or PML-N ministers have resigned from their positions or relinquished official privileges.
One cabinet member from the PML-N, who was seen accompanying his party’s senior anti-Haq leadership at one meeting, also chaired a meeting himself and released pictures from it to the media.
Of the 10 ‘forward bloc’ members, three — representing Pakistan-based refugee constituencies — had announced their resignations from the cabinet, but the same had not been accepted by the prime minister. Despite their declared dissociation, the trio also continued to enjoy official perks and privileges.
Adding to the irony, most of the ‘disgruntled’ ministers have been camped in the federal capital for weeks, engaging in slow-paced negotiations and power-sharing discussions over the formation of the next government.
Political sources claim that the tabling of the motion may take another four to five days, effectively giving more time to an embattled prime minister who has virtually lost the confidence of the assembly’s majority.
Hurried approval of schemes
Taking advantage of the situation, the incumbent premier — who had preferred to spend much of his time in Islamabad during the previous two and a half years of his rule — has unusually stationed himself in Muzaffarabad for the past 12 days, where he has been issuing directives and granting administrative approvals on files that had remained pending in his office for several months.
On October 27, he sanctioned six schemes in the energy sector worth over Rs2.68 billion — four of them worth Rs1.4bn for his home district alone. The same day, he approved releases of funds to different departments for the first half of the current fiscal year, amounting Rs3.72bn. However, the approval was withdrawn by the additional chief secretary for development the following day.
In a pointed reference to the situation, the PM’s electoral rival and PML-N Secretary General Chaudhry Tariq Farooq took to social media, expressing his surprise that the ministers who had inked out their signatures on the no-confidence resolution were still holding their portfolios and using official resources.
“Since September, AJK has been in a state of political crisis. Although the motion has not yet been formally tabled, it is astonishing that those ministers who have openly declared their intention to support it continue to remain part of the cabinet. The use of official resources and privileges goes on unabated. Good governance remains “untarnished,” and the cloak of austerity has not even been pierced. What a fixed match — and everyone knows it,” he wrote on X.
The usage of the term ‘good governance’ is actually a reference to the AJK PM, with the phrase being used ironically.
“People across AJK are both surprised and saddened by the political farce,” Mr Farooq added.
However, when PPP legislator Mian Abdul Waheed, who still holds the office of law minister in the Haq-led government, was asked by a reporter if it was unethical for cabinet members seeking to dislodge the prime minister to use official transport, he defended it.
“The day the no-confidence motion is tabled and fails, it would become morally, legally and constitutionally impermissible — absolutely haram — for us to retain these official vehicles. Until the motion is actually presented, however, there is nothing written anywhere that bars us from using them.”

• Says bill may originate in Senate instead of NA
• Stresses govt will consult allies as opposition warns of ‘constitutional crisis’
• PTI’s Ali Zafar brands move a ‘conspiracy’, claims devolution at risk
• Upper house passes Asaan Karobar Bill, extends Virtual Assets Ordinance by 120 days
ISLAMABAD: As the opposition in the Senate raised alarm over the proposed 27th constitutional amendment, Deputy Pri­me Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday confirmed the bill would be brought bef­o­re parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment.
“We will try to present it in accordance with the Constitution. I assure this will not be put to a vote in a flash,” he told the upper house while responding to PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar.
Mr Dar’s remarks came amid a sustained protest by opposition senators over the delay in appointing the leader of the opposition. He said that after the PPP, the government would take all allies on board, including the MQM, ANP, IPP and BAP. “A standard process is being followed,” he said.
The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate.
Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority.
‘Conspiracy against Constitution’
Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works.
“This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate.
“Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said.
Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”.
He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission.
However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains.
The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control.
“All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.”
He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution.
“The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?”
He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment.
The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter.
The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.”
Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak.
Asaan Karobar Bill
Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements.
Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.
The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment.
According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.”
The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.”
The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.

Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir issued the directive while hearing a petition related to the X account operated in Imran Khan’s name. The court also instructed the Deputy Attorney General and the state counsel to immediately convey the order to the jail administration through a phone call. 
A two-page written order was later released, directing the Addi­tional  Attorney General to inform the Adiala jail superintendent about the  court’s instructions. 
During the hearing, Advocate Raja informed the court that des­pite repeated court orders over the past several months, he had not been allowed to meet his client. He argued that without consulting the PTI founder, he could not respond effectively to the petition. “I need to sit and take instructions from the founder of PTI,” he said.

Aleema vows to continue struggle for her brother even if jailed

Justice Arbab Tahir remarked that the court had already permitted such meetings and questioned whether the counsel had received the written order of the larger bench. Mr Raja said that although an application for the copy had been made, it was not provided.
The court then reiterated that the jail authorities must ensure the meeting takes place on Monday and that the order be communicated to the concerned officials without delay. 
Aleema’s media talk 
Following the proceedings, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khan spoke to the media outside the court, vowing to continue the legal and political struggle for the PTI founder’s rel­ea­­se. “We will keep fighting for Imran Khan. You may jail us, but we will not abandon this cause,” she said, adding that the authorities’ actions reflected “fear of Imran Khan.”
Advocate Raja, while talking to reporters, said a citizen had filed a petition seeking deletion of tweets attributed to the PTI founder and a ban on sharing “anti-state” content through his X account.

The ministry’s focal person, Ghulam Mustafa Malik, told Dawn that Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain called the move “unacceptable”.
“Federal Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain has expressed reservations and said that no such decision will be accepted that will cause difficulties for overseas Pakistanis in travel,” Malik said.
“Although human trafficking is a big problem, it would be appropriate to avoid any move that would cause travel difficulties for overseas Pakistanis and the workforce going abroad for employment.”
Malik stated that the ministry has sent a clear message that the government is serious about protecting citizens’ fundamental rights and that no institution “will be allowed to impose unnecessary restrictions on public freedoms”.
“Now all Pakistanis who have a valid Protector Certificate will be able to travel abroad without hindrance and with peace of mind,” the focal person stated.
Overseas Pakistanis are important contributors to the economy through foreign remittances. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said last month that overseas workers’ remittances witnessed an increase of 8.41 per cent during the first quarter (July-September) of fiscal year 2025-26.
On a year-on-year basis, the SBP said workers’ remittances went up by 11.33pc in September to $3.183bn from $2.859bn during the same month last year.</p><small>2025-11-04 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04233403c9f751a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953107/contributions-all-around-as-pakistan-beat-south-africa-in-first-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Contributions all around as Pakistan beat South Africa in first ODI</strong></a><br><p>After the bowlers had done their job, the batters came good for Pakistan — albeit an all too familiar late collapse — at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday.
In the first international match at the venue in 17 years, Pakistan marked the start of Shaheen Shah Afridi’s era as One-day International captain with a two-wicket victory over South Africa to strike the opening blow in the three-match series.
Shaheen had won the toss and elected to field with his side riding on inspired spells of bowling by pacer Naseem Shah and spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl South Africa out for 263.
South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) — the duo sharing a 98-run opening stand.
But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up.
Half-centuries by Salman Ali Agha (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (57) then steadied Pakistan midway through their chase after Fakhar Zaman and Saim had laid the platform with a solid 87-run opening partnership.
Salman and Rizwan combined for another 91 after Pakistan had lost three quick wickets. Rizwan fell with Pakistan needing 68 more to win but Salman struck a breezy partnership with Hussain Talat and after the hosts had an all to familiar late collapse, Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen  saw them through to a confidence-boosting victory.
South Africa, meanwhile, will rue they were unable to capitalise on a storming start by Pretorius and De Kock.
Pretorius and De Kock, playing his first ODI since returning from retirement after the ODI World Cup, laid into the Pakistan attack from the start as South Africa reached 94-0 by the end of the 15th over.
Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay.
De Kock, however, was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls.
Shaheen, however, brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps, having hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock.
Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and one-drop Tony De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return.
Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job but just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22) and Donovan Ferreira soon became Abrar’s first victim.
Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.
South Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6.
The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish with Breetzke and Bosch but Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended the former’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball.
Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over.
Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams.
Saim and fellow opener Fakhar’s measured approach saw the side reach 53-0 in the first 10 overs. The duo stayed compact, avoiding any rash shots, but when opportunities came, they pounced on them.
After the pair added 34 more to the partnership, Saim (39 off 42, four fours and six) was trapped leg-before by South African spinner Linde, who surprised the left-hander with a quicker one.
Fakhar (45 off 57, four fours and two sixes) then holed Ferreira out to Fortuin in the deep before Fortuin struck gold with the ball, shooting in one to get Babar out lbw as Pakistan felt the heat at 106-3 by the end of the 20th over.
The hosts reached 129-3 halfway through the innings before Salman, and Rizwan at the other end amped up the run-rate, the latter flourishing with a lofted cover drive and a sweep for fours as Pakistan crossed the 150-run mark in the 29th over.
Boundaries, though, were at a premium after that – only three coming from overs 30 to 36; all of them from Rizwan’s bat. He raised his half century off 66 balls in the 37th over but fell soon after, having hit six fours in his 74-ball knock, finding Pretorius in the deep off Bosch.
Hussain, though, got going with a cracking cover drive for four, which left Pakistan needing 58 off the last 10 overs.
South Africa had restricted the boundaries in the next three overs but there was no stopping the singles as Hussain and Salman kept rotating the strike, chipping away at the total until the latter hoisted Ferreira down the ground for a sumptuous six to bring up his half-century off 56 balls.
Hussain made 22 off 25 with two fours before falling in the 46th over and was soon followed by Hasan Nawaz, stumped off Linde, before Salman departed on the last ball of the 48th over when he skied Lungi Ngidi to Ferreira – having only got the fifth four of his 71-ball innings on the previous delivery.
Nawaz, though, settled any nerves or creeping doubts when he launched Ferreira down the ground for six and despite him falling with the scores level, Pakistan got through with two balls to spare.</p><small>2025-11-04 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632131-artefacts-recovered-in-italy-returned-to-pakistan-after-decades-long-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Artefacts recovered in Italy returned to Pakistan after 'decades-long efforts'</strong></a><br><p>

According to Investigating Officer (IO) Safdar Khan, the JUI member was on his way home after offering prayers at a mosque when he was attacked by two armed suspects on a motorcycle.
“The incident is being investigated from all possible angles,” the IO said. “Police have collected evidence from the crime scene and have also called in a team of experts to provide assistance.”
The IO added that the victim’s son filed a case with the Mandani police station.
In addition to being a provincial council member, the slain Abdul Salam was the head of Madressah Abu Bakar Siddique in Tehsil Tangi and the preacher at a mosque within the area of the Jamalabad Dairy Farm.
In July this year, Awami National Party politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”</p><small>2025-11-04 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632101-27th-constitutional-amendment-to-be-tabled-soon-after-consulting-allies-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>27th Constitutional Amendment to be tabled soon after consulting allies: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported.
“Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.”
In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup.
“The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said.
During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points.
The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson.
During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s
Arshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.”
The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft.
During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said.
“As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.”
The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points.
“This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework.
“In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.</p><small>2025-11-04 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632089-pakistan-welcomes-indias-sikh-pilgrims-for-guru-nanak-anniversary-first-since-may-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan welcomes India's Sikh pilgrims, first since May war</strong></a><br><p>

India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
President Zardari addressed the issue while speaking at the Second World Summit for Social Development in Doha, Qatar today, saying: “We in Pakistan, on one hand, face the brunt of the impact of climate change, which has caused devastation for our people in the form of large-scale floods … on the other hand, we face a new threat in the form of water weaponisation. Water, which all the world knows, is an equal right of any human being and humanity.”
“We are being threatened from across the border with a new threat in the form of weaponisation of water, violation of the IWT. This poses a serious threat to 240 million Pakistanis. Such tactics cannot and will not succeed.”
 


A supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The president also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to social justice, inclusive development and global solidarity, emphasising the need to eradicate poverty, promote decent work and ensure equality and human rights for all.
The president expressed full support for the Doha Political Declaration and highlighted that the country’s vision for inclusiveness and sustainable development aligned with the spirit of the declaration.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in placing people at the centre of policy,” President Zardari added.
Showcasing Pakistan’s progress, he cited the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which he said had empowered over nine million families through income assistance, healthcare and education. The initiative, he said, was recognised globally as one of the best social protection models.
He also reaffirmed the country’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, pledging to raise literacy to 90 per cent and ensure every child attended school within five years.
The president also mentioned initiatives such as the National Youth Internship Programme and green and resilient housing projects, which aim to empower young people and strengthen climate resilience through nature-based solutions, including mangrove restoration.
Outlining a roadmap to translate the Doha Declaration into action, Zardari urged the world to unite around three pillars: dignity, equality and solidarity, emphasising global financial reforms, debt relief, equitable taxation and expanded social protection.
Condemning  the “genocide, apartheid, and mass starvation” in Palestine, the president also called for a just and lasting peace.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for the people of Kashmir, linking both struggles as two sides of the same coin in the pursuit of justice and self-determination.
“Development must begin and end with the betterment of people,” President Zardari said, adding that “we must rise above all differences to embark on a path of compassion and progress for all.”
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also drew the attention of the UN secretary general to India’s weaponisation of water, pointing out that India had unilaterally and illegally suspended the water-sharing agreement and stopped providing discharge data on rivers, creating man-made disasters for Pakistan.
In a meeting with the UN chief, President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong support for multilateralism and the central role of the UN in promoting peace, equity and shared prosperity.
He underscored the importance of resolving longstanding disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and called for the reversal of India’s unilateral and illegal measures.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s principled position on Palestine, stressing the need to end the suffering of the Palestinian people and to uphold their right to self-determination through the establishment of a viable, contiguous, and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He also appreciated the UN chief’s leadership in addressing global challenges and for his continued support to Pakistan.
The president raised the issue of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, recalling that it remained one of the oldest unresolved items on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
He urged the implementation of relevant UN resolutions to ensure a just and lasting settlement in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
President Zardari also highlighted Pakistan’s longstanding contribution to UN peacekeeping operations, noting that Pakistani peacekeepers had served with distinction in conflict zones across the world.
The UN chief acknowledged Pakistan’s significant role in peacekeeping and expressed solidarity with Pakistan in its efforts to combat terrorism.
 






Meetings with Iraqi, Tajik counterparts
Zardari also met Iraqi counterpart Dr Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid, both reviewing the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirming their mutual commitment to further strengthening longstanding ties.
Discussing trade and investment, both sides underlined the importance of enhancing economic linkages through increased business-to-business interactions and facilitative visa regimes.
President Zardari appreciated Iraq’s cooperation in facilitating Pakistani pilgrims and acknowledged the valuable contribution of the Pakistani community in Iraq, which served as a bridge of goodwill between the two nations.
The two leaders also exchanged views on regional peace, stability and cooperation, agreeing to maintain regular high-level contacts to advance bilateral relations.
The Iraqi president again invited President Zardari to visit Iraq.
The president accepted the invitation and stated that he would undertake the visit soon after the Iraqi parliamentary elections, scheduled for later this month.
 






He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity, energy, defence and people-to-people exchanges with Tajikistan.
President Zardari said that Pakistan greatly valued its multifaceted relationship with Tajikistan, rooted in shared history, culture, and linguistic affinity.
He noted that the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in 2024 reflected the growing depth of ties between the two countries. He welcomed the resumption of work on the CASA-1000 project, terming it a flagship initiative for shared prosperity, and invited Tajikistan to explore new avenues of trade and connectivity through Pakistan, including the possibility of restoring direct flights.
President Zardari also commended the successful Dosti-II joint military exercise held in August 2025 and reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to assist Tajikistan in defence cooperation and capacity building.
The Tajik president invited Zardari to visit the country, which the latter accepted.
The two leaders also shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.
