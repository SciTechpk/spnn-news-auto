Fatima Sana’s side crashed out of the ICC Women’s World Cup on Tuesday after a crushing 150-run defeat (DLS method) to South Africa in their penultimate match of the league stage at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
Pakistan needed a victory to have any chance of staying alive in the last-four race and already-qualified South Africa, but chasing a target, that was revised with every downpour, they stood little chance after the Proteas amassed 312-9 in 40 overs.
The first shower, which had brought upon a two-hour delay, had seen a reduction of 10 overs for each side. By the time Pakistan came out for a third time to bat, their target according to the DLS method, was 234 in 20 overs.
Pakistan were already up against the wall at that point, struggling at 60-4 after 14 overs. They eventually finished at 83-7.
South Africa had been put into bat and after the early loss of opener Tazmin Brits for a duck, skipper Laura Wolvaardt led from the front for the Proteas — scoring 90 and combining with Sune Luus for a 118-run second wicket partnership.
Continuing after the break from 6-1 after two overs, the Pakistan bowlers were taken to all parts as South Africa reached their highest-ever score in the World Cup.
Fatima’s side had to rush to the dugout as soon as the match began, after having won the toss and elected to field, as the heavens opened up.
Moments before the players took cover, the Pakistan skipper continued her knack of getting early breakthroughs when she got the dangerous Brits to nick an away swinger to Natalia Parvaiz at first slip.
Once play resumed, the run-fest started for the Proteas, with the hundred coming up in just 14.2 overs.
After Wolvaardt and Luus departed for 90 and 61 respectively, Marizanne Kapp and the dangerous Nadine de Klerk stepped up to take the scoring rate even higher.
De Klerk continued her fine hitting form in the World Cup — smashing 41	of just 16 deliveries laced with three sixes to take South Africa past the 300-run mark.
Rains in Colombo had seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push.
The washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament. Tuesday’s victory saw the Proteas go top of the table.</p><small>2025-10-21 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212039529cf2965.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950381/mohsin-naqvi-adamant-on-ceremony-for-asia-cup-trophy-handover-as-india-increase-pressure' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi adamant on ceremony for Asia Cup trophy handover as India increase pressure</strong></a><br><p>The deadlock over the Asia Cup trophy — which India refused to collect at the closing ceremony last month amid Pakistan-India hostilities — continued on Tuesday as the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) contacted Asian Cricket Council (ACC) head Mohsin Naqvi to hand over the trophy, Indian media reported citing sources.
Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy.
Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India.
Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month.
However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi.
There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “disrespected cricket”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides.
A couple days after the incident, Naqvi posted on X saying: “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.
The Press Trust of India reported today that the cricket boards of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka backed BCCI’s correspondence to Naqvi.
“A top ACC source told PTI that Naqvi has insisted that a BCCI representative collect the trophy from him at the body’s headquarters in Dubai but the Indian board has rejected that stance,” PTI said.
“The BCCI will bring this matter up in an ICC meeting next month.”
According to the ACC source: “The BCCI secretary, BCCI’s ACC representative Rajeev Shukla and representatives of other member boards including Sri Lanka Cricket and Afghanistan had written to the ACC president last week over handing the trophy to India.”
The eight-nation Asia Cup remained under spotlight due to political strains between India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed neighbours, who were competing in an international cricket event four months after a brief but intense military conflict in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgaam attack that killed 26 local tourists in the Indian-occupied Kashmir.
The tension between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over into the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Asia Cup staged in the UAE when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts when the arch-rivals met in their group stage match in Dubai.
Suryakumar was widely criticised for politicising the Asia Cup when he mentioned Pahalgaam incident and Indian armed forces during his post-ma­tch talk and subsequent news conference.
The Pakistan camp, on their part, had avoided media interaction on the occasion of the India match. The tense situation remained the same, rather aggravated as on-field verbal skirmishes between some players took place, when the two sides met in the Super Four stage of the event.</p><small>2025-10-21 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2114173908187dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950366/ke-says-nepra-revision-has-slashed-its-tariff-by-rs76kwh-will-have-far-reaching-consequences' target='_blank'><strong>KE says Nepra revision has slashed its tariff by Rs7.6/kWh, ‘will have far-reaching consequences’</strong></a><br><p>K-Electric (KE) said on Tuesday that following the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) recent decision on a set of review motions, its average tariff had reduced by Rs7.6/kWh, which would have “far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”.
According to KE, power regulatory authority’s decision has resulted in a reduction of its average tariff from the previously announced Rs39.97/kWh to Rs32.37/kWh.
However, the utility clarified that the recent announcement by the regulator does not apply to customers and, therefore, there would be no change or reduction in monthly bills for power consumers.
On May 27, Nepra had set KE’s base tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which was almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos) in the country.
The delta between the Discos’ average and KE’s tariff was transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy. Subsequently, motions for leave for reviews were filed by multiple parties, on which Nepra’s decision was notified yesterday.
In a press release following the decision, KE noted that Nepra had issued its decision on the motions filed by various parties, concerning KE’s multi-year tariff (MYT) determinations for the control period of FY 2024-30.
“The decision covers several key areas, including the MYT determination for KE’s generation power plants, the MYT determination for KE’s transmission, distribution (network), and supply businesses for FY 2024 to FY 2030, the transmission and distribution investment plan and losses assessment for FY 2024 to FY 2030, and the write-off claims of KE for MYT 2017–2023.
“With respect to the write-off claims, Nepra has upheld its earlier decision. However, for the other matters, Nepra has significantly altered its prior determinations in a manner that, according to KE, is not sustainable for the company and will have far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers,” KE said.
It added that it was currently “reviewing Nepra’s decisions in detail and will exercise all available remedies as permitted under the applicable laws and regulatory framework”.
Nepra’s decision
Nepra’s decision on the review petitions were detailed in a notification that was issued yesterday and is available with Dawn.com.
The notification said Nepra had decided to revise the fuel cost reference of the power purchase price for FY 2023-24, adding that it, however, “understands that with the revision of these fuel cost component references, already determined for the FY 2023-24, all monthly fuel cost adjustments, already determined and applied for the FY 2023-24, would be required to be re determined, and the additional impact would he passed on to the consumers of KE”.
“Considering the fact that FY 2023-24 has already lapsed and the actual power purchase cost of KE to the extent of variable operation and maintenance cost and capacity charges is also now available, the authority has decided to actualise such costs […] alongwith the transmission charges, as approved and
have been made part of power purchase price references for the FY 2023-24.”
According to the notification, in light of discussions on the issue of reference fuel cost component, Nepra directed KE to file revised fuel cost adjustment claims for FY 2023-24 for consideration and approval. The notification said power purchase price references for FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26 “would be determined once KE files its revised annual adjustment/ indexation
request for these periods”.
Moreover, concerns were also raised before regarding the replacement of “long-standing price-cap tariff regime historically applied to KE” with a “revenue-cap approach” that allowed the “actualisation of units sent out without any associated performance benchmarks”.
On this issue, Nepra said it did “not see any rationale to change its
earlier decision, and hence has decided to maintain its earlier decision in this matter”.
It also addressed the issue of operation and maintenance costs, regarding which KE contended that allowing reference operation and maintenance costs for next based on lower or allowed cost of the previous year would  “disincentivise the utility to bring any efficiency and save costs” and “make operations unviable in period of low inflations”.
KE also argued that the sharing mechanism of 50:50 between KE and consumers in case actual operation and maintenance costs for the year turn out to be lower than the allowed was “unprecedented” as it was not included in tariffs for Discos, National Transmission and Dispatch Company and other transmission licensees.
Other parties also expressed reservations regarding the sharing mechanism, the notification said, adding they also pointed out that KE’s operation and maintenance cost for FY 2023-24 had been based on the utility’s “unaudited financial statements”
“Instead, the approved operation and maintenance cost for the last year of the previous MYT i.e. FY 2022-23, should have been used as a base reference,” they contended.
Nepra, however, maintained that it “does not see any rationale to change its
earlier decision” on the matter and decided to uphold it, the notification said.
The notification added that Nepra also considered KE’s request to allow it the retention of the “entire amount” of late payment surcharge.
“The authority noted that KE has already been allowed working capital to meet its financial obligations. Further, to compensate KE for any delayed recoveries from consumers, KE has also been allowed retention of LPS (late payment surcharge) to the extent of supplemental charges, if any, which KE may incur owing to such delays, except supplemental charges billed by CPPA-G (Central Power Purchasing Agency), as KE has entered into an MCA (Master Collection Account) arrangement with it,” the notification said. It added that Nepra further highlighted that the existing methodology for late payment surcharge for KE was also in line with the one adopted for Discos.
Subsequently, Nepra decided to maintain its earlier decision on the matter.
It also rejected requests to shorten the seven-year tariff control period, stating that “no cogent reasons have been provided by the petitioners”.
Objections were also raised regarding the sharing mechanism of other income for KE, but Nepra decided to maintain its earlier decision in this matter as well, according to the notification.
It said Nepra further observed that “serious concerns” were raised on the upfront recovery loss allowed to KE. The contention here was that the permitted recovery loss allowance “effectively transfers the financial burden of KE’s inefficiencies onto the paying consumers or on the national exchequer through subsidies”.
“The financial burden […] owing to reduced recovery targets is estimated at Rs36 billion for FY 2023-24, that may exceed over Rs200bn during the MYT control period, which would be picked up by the federal government through fiscal space,” it read. Moreover, Nepra said it understood the the Power Division was “actively pursuing [the] privatisation of other Discos”, so its request for “not allowing any upfront recovery loss can be construed as a policy decision, meaning thereby that similar treatment will be offered to future privatised Discos”.
In light of these observations, the regulatory authority decided not to allow any upfront recovery loss to KE, in order to ensure that no financial burden was passed on to the federal government through subsidies, considering application of uniform tariff across the country.
It further stated that “KE’s tariff is being determined on the basis of 100 per cent recovery target. KE, however, will be allowed to claim write-offs, after fulfillment of the given criteria, as per the following limits, to be considered as
maximum cap for the relevant year”.
According to the notification, the limit for FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 has been set at 3.50pc, for FY 2025-26 at 3pc, for FY 2026-27 at 2.50pc, for FY 2027-28 at 2pc, for FY 2028-29 at 1.50pc and for FY 2029-30 at 1pc.
On requests to revise the working capital, Nepra said while it was maintaining its earlier decision and not revising the capital itself, the authority had adjusted the number of days used for the purpose of calculation of current liabilities part of the working capital.
“Similarly, cash and bank balances requirement earlier allowed for 15 days, have been excluded from working capital calculations. The authority has also decided to adjust the double impact of net-meting cost, however, again rejects the inclusion of costs on account of lag in the recovery” of fuel adjustment costs, quarterly tariff adjustments, etc.
Nepra also rejected requests pertaining to K-Solar, a subsidiary of KE.
Addressing concerns regarding the adjustment of open access charges in revenue requirement, Nepra referred to a previous decision, according to which “any charges to be recovered by KE on account of open access, […], as per the applicable framework, would be adjusted in the allowed revenue
requirement of KE”. However, the notification said, the Nepra had decided to “further clarify that any costs arising out on account of open access/ revenue recovered including use of system charges, cross subsidy, marginal price, open access costs or any other cost, shall be adjusted as per the applicable framework and in light of the relevant determinations of the Authority for such costs”.
Furthermore, Nepra maintained its earlier decision on KE’s request to allow fuel cost adjustments and quarterly adjustments during the year based on actual transmission and distribution losses, saying, “Since the matter primarily pertains to the assessment of T&D loss target of KE, therefore, any decision taken by the authority in the investment plan/ assessment of T&D losses decision of KE, would be accordingly considered while making monthly/ quarterly tariff adjustments”.</p><small>2025-10-21 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212148472b9fb12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950399/former-french-president-sarkozy-starts-5-year-prison-sentence' target='_blank'><strong>Former French president Sarkozy starts 5-year prison sentence</strong></a><br><p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year sentence on Tuesday for conspiring to raise campaign funds from Libya, arriving at La Sante prison in Paris in a stunning downfall for a man who led the country between 2007 and 2012.
The former conservative president, 70, left his home for the car journey to the prison, walking hand in hand with his wife Carla Bruni and cheered by a crowd of supporters chanting “Nicolas, Nicolas” and singing La Marseillaise national anthem.
Sarkozy, who was convicted and sentenced last month, is the first former French leader to be jailed since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain after World War Two.
Sarkozy says he is innocent
Shortly after he headed for La Sante, Sarkozy published a long message on X in which he claimed to be a victim of revenge and hatred.
“I want to tell [French people], with the unshakeable strength that is mine, that it is not a former president of the republic who is being imprisoned this morning — it is an innocent man,” he said.
 






Sarkozy’s conviction capped years of legal battles over allegations that his 2007 campaign took millions in cash from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was later overthrown and killed during the Arab Spring uprisings.
While Sarkozy was found guilty of conspiring with close aides to orchestrate the scheme, he was acquitted of personally receiving or using the funds.
He has consistently denied wrongdoing and has called the case politically motivated.
His lawyers said they had filed a request for early release, pending his appeals trial, and that they expected this request to be reviewed in about a month. They said they hoped they could get Sarkozy freed on early release by Christmas.
Sarkozy to be held in isolation unit
Sarkozy will likely be held in La Sante’s isolation unit, where inmates are housed in single cells and kept apart during outdoor activities for security reasons.
Conditions are similar to the rest of the prison: cells measure 9 to 12 square metres and, following renovations, now include private showers.
Sarkozy will have access to a television — for a monthly fee of 14 euros ($16) — and a landline telephone.
Sarkozy told Le Figaro he would take three books for his first week behind bars, including Alexandre Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo — the story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned and who plots his revenge against those who betrayed him.
The decision to jail a former president has sparked outrage among Sarkozy’s political allies and the far right.
“Nicolas Sarkozy is not a criminal,” said Sarkozy supporter Jacqueline Fraboulet, who was among the crowd cheering him on Tuesday. “We actually feel like the justice system is taking the power, and that’s not good for France.”
Sarkozy’s children and brothers also attended the gathering. Sarkozy, looking sombre, waved at his supporters before heading into his car for the journey to La Sante.
France gets tougher on white-collar crime
The sentencing reflected a shift in France’s approach to white-collar crime. In the 1990s and 2000s, many convicted politicians avoided prison altogether.
Despite his legal troubles, Sarkozy’s political influence has proved resilient as French society has shifted to the right.
President Emmanuel Macron, who had warm relations with Sarkozy and Bruni, said on Monday he had met Sarkozy ahead of his incarceration. Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said he would visit him in prison.
That angered left-wing politicians who said Macron and Darmanin were breaching judicial independence.
The son of a Hungarian immigrant, Sarkozy became president in 2007, pledging to shake things up with pro-business reforms that would reinvigorate France’s stagnant economy and elevate the country to the top table of global players.
Those efforts were quickly upended by the 2008-2009 economic crisis, and voters gave him little credit for raising the retirement age to 62 from 60 and loosening rules requiring a maximum 35-hour work week.</p><small>2025-10-21 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212011092bd2f22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950395/centre-asks-punjab-to-facilitate-imran-cm-afridi-meeting-for-kp-cabinet-formation' target='_blank'><strong>Centre asks Punjab to facilitate Imran–CM Afridi meeting for KP cabinet formation</strong></a><br><p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Huzaifa Rehman said on Tuesday that the Centre has asked the Punjab government to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and PTI founder Imran Khan to facilitate the formation of the provincial cabinet.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister last week, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input.
He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran. He approached the Islamabad High Court on Friday, seeking permission to meet Imran.
Questioned about the matter in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Rehman said: “I hope this meeting will take place in the coming days. The federal government has asked the provincial government to arrange this so the cabinet there (in KP) can be formed.”
Asked again whether the Centre had issued a direction for the meeting to the Punjab government, Rehman clarified that while an order could not be given since the provincial governments were autonomous, the prime minister had “urged” the provincial authorities and the federal government had also requested to “do this as soon as possible”.
Rehman added that as per his information, the Punjab government was devising a mechanism and fulfilling all “cordial formalities”, adding that the meeting would be “held soon”.
Speaking during Monday’s KP Assembly session, CM Afridi said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for ensuring his meeting with Imran, but to no avail.
He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/211819057d4a986.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950388/talal-terms-kp-govts-inaction-against-terrorism-ploy-for-political-point-scoring' target='_blank'><strong>Talal terms KP govt’s inaction against terrorism ploy for ‘political point scoring’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday criticised newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, accusing the provincial government of undermining counter-terrorism efforts for political point scoring.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements.
The remarks come a day after the KP CM blamed the federal government’s “flawed policy” for the resurgence of terrorism in KP, during his first official high-level meeting since assuming office on October 15, after the former CM Ali Amin Gandapur resigned earlier this month on the directions of party chairman Imran Khan.

He alleged that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled.
Addressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.”
Talal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”.
“You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.”
Citing Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”.
“The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior.
On the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”.
Responding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.”
A day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
“What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.”
He also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/211654337d0c93f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950389/two-sc-judges-warn-new-code-of-conduct-will-restrict-judicial-freedom-create-avenues-for-control' target='_blank'><strong>Two SC judges warn new code of conduct will restrict judicial freedom, create avenues for control</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar have said that changes recently made to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges will restrict judicial freedom and create avenues for internal and external control, it emerged on Tuesday.
On October 18, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) approved far-reaching amendments to the Code of Conduct, barring superior court judges from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Shah and Akhtar. Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and her Islamabad counterpart Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
 
 

In the latest letter penned to the SJC chair and its members, Justices Shah and Akhtar said they had submitted their unsigned written comments at the start of the meeting in a letter dated October 17.
The duo then revised those comments to incorporate the “unfortunate and constitutionally inappropriate development” of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC) discussing the Code of Conduct when the matter “lies solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the SJC”.
“These proposals, if adopted, will restrict judicial freedom, transform an open and collegial institution into a closed and hierarchical one, and create avenues for control, both internal and external,” Justices Shah and Akhtar said.
Among the various tweaks, the judges strongly objected to the amendment made to the Code of Conduct’s Article V, under which judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
They also took exception to the insertion of Article XIX, which provides an “institutional response” for judges facing any “influence”, under which they will report to their respective chief justice, who will then inform the CJP.
 
 

“In the current political and institutional climate — where pressures on the judiciary are widely perceived — such a mechanism can be manipulated to suppress legitimate whistleblowing by judges who resist external interference,” the judges wrote.
On the incorporation of the 2003 SJC Resolutions/Guidelines, which includes a bar on attending social, cultural, political and diplomatic functions, the judges said it “reduces the judiciary’s visibility and connection to the community”.
Another clause treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct. The judges criticised this as well, noting that judges attend such seminars to “enhance comparative learning and professional competence-activities that strengthen judicial capacity, not diminish it”.
Justices Shah and Akhtar detailed 10 “weaknesses and risks” posed by the amendments to Article V alone, which is related to judges’ freedom of speech.
“The phrases ‘public controversy’ and ‘political questions’ are undefined and could encompass nearly every matter of constitutional or legal significance,” they pointed out.
They expressed the apprehension that the “fear of being accused of ‘public controversy’ will compel judges to remain silent on matters of constitutional importance, even outside the courtroom”.
“This self-censorship undermines intellectual growth within the judiciary and weakens the development of constitutional jurisprudence.”
On the ban on “any interaction with the media”, the judges said it “amounts to a gag order, imposing total silence and insulating the institution from public scrutiny”.
On the new rule for judges to “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly”, they said it shields the judiciary from external accountability and disables judges from defending the institution publicly.
 
 

Justices Shah and Akhtar also cautioned that the provision “could be selectively invoked against outspoken judges, particularly those critical of executive
overreach or internal mismanagement”, creating a “chilling effect” and opening the door to disciplinary misuse.
The judges further said: “In Pakistan’s fragile democratic environment, such a clause can be easily weaponised by executive or establishment forces through compliant leadership to silence independent voices within the judiciary.”
“During ‘testing times’ for democracy, judicial independence requires openness, moral courage-not silence or conformity.”
Postponement sought as IHC CJ seniority, 26th Amendment under challenge
Justices Shah and Akhtar also listed multiple reservations regarding the procedure of the amendments’ approval.
The judges recalled that in a letter dated October 13,  they had “proposed that the present [SJC] meeting be postponed, or the Council be re-constituted, given that the seniority and status of Honourable Justice Sarfraz Dogar in his high court are under challenge” before the SC.
“The outcome of that case will directly determine his eligibility to serve as a member of the Supreme Judicial Council.”
Justices Shah and Akhtar also highlighted that the 26th Amendment remains under challenge before the SC.
 
 

“Until that matter is decided, the status of the chairperson and one of the members is sub judice. Constitutional propriety therefore requires that no amendments to the Code be undertaken until that issue is settled,” they said.
The earlier October 13 letter stated, “While we would obviously not wish to comment on sub judice matters, it goes without saying that there is always an inherent uncertainty involved in any litigation, no matter how sanguine one may be about the outcome.”
It added that the decision in that case could directly affect Justice Dogar’s membership of the SJC, and consequently the council’s composition. The judge had also suggested it would be appropriate “if Justice Dogar recuses himself, then the council may proceed with its meetings/proceedings”.
 
 

“The decision in those proceedings can directly affect the Hon’ble Judge’s membership of, and consequently the composition of the Council.
They noted that since “three chief justices participating today (October 18) are ex officio members of both the NJPMC and the SJC, their participation in approving the amendments at the NJPMC meant that the majority of the SJC had effectively predecided the matter before it was even placed before the Council”.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629774-lg-polls-ecp-gives-punjab-govt-four-weeks-for-delimitations-under-new-act' target='_blank'><strong>LG polls: ECP gives Punjab govt four weeks for delimitations under new Act</strong></a><br><p>

India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid.
About a dozen countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan FM to India, the government is restoring the status of the technical mission of India in Kabul to that of embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said a press release issued today by India’s Ministry of External Affairs.
It added the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.
The MEA elaborated that the embassy will “further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance and capacity-building initiatives, in keeping with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society”.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had announced the embassy’s reopening earlier this month as he began talks with Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on what was the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.</p><small>2025-10-21 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629772-private-news-channel-apologises-to-maryam-nawaz-after-uk-defamation-case' target='_blank'><strong>Private news channel apologises to Maryam Nawaz after UK defamation case</strong></a><br><p>

The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting, along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership.
The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters.
“The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”.
He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace.
 






Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.”
“Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added.
On Saturday, the army chief had cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country.
He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-21 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212057111cb0af4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950387/shrinking-habitats-rising-poaching-push-pakistans-bears-towards-the-brink' target='_blank'><strong>Shrinking habitats, rising poaching push Pakistan’s bears towards the brink</strong></a><br><p>A combination of threats, from shrinking habitats and increased human-animal conflict to poaching and environmental degradation, has accelerated the decline of Pakistan’s bear population over the past decade, according to local wildlife experts.
Although no comprehensive scientific surveys have been conducted to determine the exact numbers of bears in the country, experts estimate a 20-30 per cent decline in their population over the past 10 years.
Muhammad Kabir, head of the Wildlife Ecology Lab at the University of Haripur, said that while a few regions in Pakistan still have healthy bear populations, the overall trend remains worrying.
“So much so, bears have become locally extinct from several areas, where they once were believed to have been in ‘good numbers’,” Kabir told Anadolu.
Pakistan is home to two species of bears — the Himalayan brown bear and the Asiatic black bear.
The black bear is further divided into two subspecies — the Himalayan black bear (U. t. laniger), found in the temperate forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Balochistan black bear (U. t. gedrosianus), which inhabits the arid montane regions of Balochistan, particularly around Khuzdar and Kalat districts and adjoining areas along the Iran border.
“Bears have been facing multiple threats, which has put them in the list of highly vulnerable species in Pakistan,” Kabir said.
 
 

He cited habitat loss, deforestation, expanding infrastructure, agricultural encroachment and illegal poaching as the leading causes of decline. Human-wildlife conflict, he added, is further exacerbating the situation.
Faizan Ahmad, a researcher at the Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar, said the Asiatic black bear — once widespread across Asia’s forests — was now under severe pressure in the country.
“Its population is shrinking, fragmented and increasingly drawn into human-modified landscapes where resource scarcity, habitat degradation, and human–wildlife conflict intersect,” Ahmad told Anadolu.
He added that as human settlements expand and forest ecosystems become more fragmented, bears are often forced into conflict-prone areas, threatening both conservation efforts and rural livelihoods.
Local extinction
There are no official nationwide population surveys for bears in Pakistan, but indirect indicators such as habitat degradation, increased human-bear conflict and poaching reports point to a steady decline.
Based on recent field data, Ahmad said it was reasonable to estimate a 20-30pc population decline in Asiatic black bears over the past decade.
Currently, around 150-200 Himalayan brown bears survive in small, isolated populations across northern Pakistan. The most stable population is found in GB’s Deosai Plateau, where conservation efforts have led to population growth in recent years.
Deosai National Park remains the only protected area in Pakistan where a regular census is conducted to monitor bear numbers. A smaller population also exists in Khunjerab National Park near the border with China.
 
 

The forested districts of Swat, Kohistan, Upper Dir and Shangla in KP; AJK’s Neelum Valley and GB’s Diamer district host the Himalayan black bear.
According to Kabir, the combined population of Himalayan and Balochistan black bears ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 individuals.
“Black bear has vanished from several parts of KP, particularly Ayubia region over the past three to four decades,” he said.
Ahmad added that national estimates suggest fewer than 2,500 bears remain across Pakistan, with the Balochistan black bear population likely reduced to fewer than 50 mature individuals.
“This subspecies is now critically endangered in Pakistan and among the least studied large carnivores in the country,” he maintained.
Medicinal value
Despite legal protection, bear cubs are still poached, particularly in early spring when dens are more accessible.
“Local accounts describe poachers lighting fires at den entrances to force mothers and cubs out; the mother is killed, and cubs are sold for bear dancing or bear-baiting,” Ahmad said, referring to the cruel practice where bears are chained and forced to fight dogs for public entertainment.
In addition to illegal trade, bears are hunted in autumn for their pelts and fat. Kabir explained that bear bile (Xiongdan in Chinese) — the dried gallbladder of the Asiatic black bear — has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years.
He said it is believed to treat ailments such as liver disorders, fever, digestive problems and inflammation. Bear bile contains ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a compound also used in modern medicine to treat certain liver diseases and dissolve gallstones.
However, the extraction of bile and gallbladders is highly controversial due to its cruelty and devastating impact on wild populations. Conservationists and animal welfare groups have long called for synthetic or plant-based alternatives to bear bile products.
Ahmad emphasised that conservation measures must include habitat protection and restoration, conflict mitigation, den protection, community engagement and long-term monitoring.
“Community-based conflict mitigation strategies, such as compensation schemes, use of non-lethal deterrents and crop protection measures are essential to shift from conflict to coexistence,” he said.
He added that engaging local communities in conservation not only safeguards camera traps and monitoring infrastructure but also encourages local stewardship of wildlife resources.
Ecological threat
Azan Karam, a Swat-based wildlife expert, warned that Pakistan’s declining bear population poses a serious ecological threat because bears play a crucial role as both keystone and umbrella species.
“Its presence supports essential ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal, carcass scavenging and insect regulation, all of which contribute to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health,” Karam told Anadolu.
He said a reduction in bear numbers could disrupt these natural processes, leading to long-term ecological imbalance.
“Moreover, as an umbrella species, conserving the black bear means protecting large, diverse habitats that also support many other wildlife species. Its decline signals broader biodiversity loss across Pakistan’s temperate forests,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-21 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629754-pml-n-announces-split-from-ajk-govt' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N announces split from AJK govt</strong></a><br><p>

A notification issued by the commission today said the assembly’s tenure was to expire on November 24 and it was the commission’s constitutional duty to organise and conduct general elections and local government elections in GB, along with making all necessary arrangements to ensure that they were conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, while safeguarding the process from corrupt practices.
“The general public has expressed genuine concerns about appointments, upgradations, and transfers of government officers and officials across various departments during this sensitive pre-election period. These actions have given rise to apprehensions that they may be politically motivated, potentially weakening public trust in the fairness and integrity of the election process.”
“After careful consideration of these concerns, the GB Election Commission believes that such appointments, upgradations, and posting/transfers carried out during the election period risk being viewed as attempts to gain political advantage. This perception could weaken public trust in the neutrality, impartiality, and overall integrity of the electoral process,” the election commission added.
“The commission has also observed growing public concern, regarding the diversion of development funds from approved projects to politically motivated schemes, which clearly constitutes another form of pre-poll influence and has the potential to distort the level playing field among candidates,” the notification said.
It added that it became necessary for the commission to exercise its lawful powers to maintain neutrality and fairness in governance affairs in order to uphold public confidence in the electoral process, to ensure equal opportunity for all candidates, to protect the sanctity and impartiality of the forthcoming general elections, and to prevent abuse of state resources for electoral advantage.
The GB chief election commissioner (CEC) thus ordered that all forms of recruitment or appointment in any regional department, organisation or institution were banned with immediate effect except recruitments made through the Federal Public Service Commission and cases where tests/interviews were already completed by today or where recruitment was urgently needed in the public interest.
The GB CEC further ordered that no new development scheme, community-based initiative or announcement-based project should be awarded, processed or initiated in any form until the next elections were held and a new government assumed office.
Furthermore, any diversion of funds already allocated to development projects in GB was strictly prohibited, with all diverted funds to remain frozen with immediate effect.
“No transfer or posting of government officers/officials shall be made except in cases of genuine public interest, and only after obtaining prior approval/NOC (no-objection certificate) from the GB Election Commission upon submission of a formal proposal.
“No government functionary or elected representative shall announce or inaugurate any new development scheme or project during the election period.
“All development funds relating to local government institutions in GB shall stand frozen with immediate effect until the official announcement of election results. However, in exceptional cases involving extreme urgency or matters of overriding public importance, utilisation of such funds may be permitted strictly upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission,” the notification further ordered.
It directed that funds allocated to ongoing schemes should continue to be utilised strictly in accordance with the approved Planning Manual and  Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules without any alteration or modification.
The notification further stated that no creation, alteration or announcement of new administrative units, sub-divisions or similar territorial entities should be made. during the election period under any circumstances.
Listing off more directions, the commission further ordered: “No proposal for the creation of new posts shall be submitted to the GB Finance Department. Likewise, no case of re-designation, up-gradation, concurrence or conveyance of new creation shall be processed by the GB Finance Department or the Services & General Administration Department. However, genuine cases duly justified may be considered only upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission.”
“Release of additional funds for new maintenance works is prohibited except in cases of extreme emergency in the public interest, duly justified to and only after obtaining NOC/approval from the GB Election Commission.”
“No new policy, directive, rule or regulation shall be issued or implemented after the issuance of this notification until the formation of the next provincial government.”
The notification said it would come into force with immediate effect and would remain operative until the conclusion of the forthcoming GB general elections and local government elections.</p><small>2025-10-21 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629744-coas-says-action-underway-against-indian-proxies-terrorists-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir says action underway against Indian proxies, terrorists in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

The TLP, which began a protest march in Lahore earlier this month, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. The march and sit-in, which reached Muridke, quickly turned into violent clashes between protesters and police before the protesters were dispersed, leading to a crackdown on the party and its supporters.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, the Punjab information minister said “false stories” were being perpetuated about the operation in Muridke.
“Three civilians were martyred in Muridke. These were people who were passing by or standing off to the side,” she said, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen out of 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said.
The minister also said that police vans had been stolen and eight were set on fire. Referring to “exclusive” footage of the clashes that was aired at the press conference, she said, “They brought trolleys full of bricks … and the sad thing is, they did all of this in the name of religion, Palestine, and Gaza.”
She also displayed footage of valuable items recovered from the residence of the party’s leader, saying, “1.920 kilograms of gold; 898g of silver; 69 branded watches, 28 gold bracelets … in the name of charity, they bring it back home,” she said.
She urged children “who love their faith” not to be taken in by groups that use it for political or financial gain, and requested parents to not send their children to be involved in such activities.
“Don’t be used in the political agendas of others,” she said. “Stories on social media are scripted.”
“We are not moving or transferring anyone’s grave or shrine,” she said, adding, “But to use that grave to collect charity, to gather people and provoke violence — the Punjab government won’t allow that.”
Bokhari said that all the accounts of those who financed terrorist groups were frozen and that those who financed them, or supported them on social media, would be prosecuted and charged with terrorism.
“No mosque is being demolished; what Muslim can even think of that?” she said, adding that the mosques and seminaries would be turned over to “righteous religious groups”.
The provincial information minister stressed that the government was “not against any sect”, but rather against “that mindset that makes people resort to violence”.
She further said that the government had now taken over 330 mosques that were under the TLP.
“We are not against any group, but this is for the country,” she said. “The loudspeakers will be used only for azaan and the mosques only for prayers.”
She also said that 223 seminaries of the TLP had been geotagged and details of them obtained, adding that they would soon be reopened and that most had already reopened.
“Six madressahs were built on government property, that had no records,” the minister pointed out, “and no one had the right to question it, because then a fatwa-i-qatal would have been announced.”
She said that those who had taken the law into their own hands and were responsible for the injuries and deaths of civilians and police would be prosecuted under anti-terror laws.
“Both the brothers are being traced; they have not been shot or arrested,” she said, referring to Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas. “They have fled, and we will arrest them soon.”
Bokhari also said that the decision to ban the TLP is expected in the next few days.
The minister added that the time was “now or never” for Pakistan to decide if it wanted to be a democratic and progressive Islamic country.
“The government has decided, now it is on the people.”
Authorities in Punjab claimed yesterday to have traced the whereabouts of Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the crackdown in Muridke.</p><small>2025-10-21 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21101246d028875.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950351/lahore-karachi-among-top-5-most-polluted-cities-in-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore, Karachi among top 5 most polluted cities in world</strong></a><br><p>Lahore and Karachi were among the top five most polluted cities in terms of air quality on Tuesday, according to monitoring platform IQAir.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various cities of the country, most notably Lahore, deal with smog especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, stubble burning and air movement.
Ranked the world’s third most polluted city yesterday, Lahore rose to the second spot today with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 234 at 11am, categorised as “very unhealthy”. The provincial capital trailed just behind New Delhi, which had an “hazardous” AQI of 489.
Karachi recorded an AQI of 182 at 11am, falling in the “unhealthy” range and just barely behind Kuwait’s capital at 183. India’s Mumbai came in at fifth with an AQI of 169.

By 4pm, the AQI for Lahore had dropped to 154, placing it sixth on the list, while Karachi was still the third-most polluted city with an AQI of 165.
IQAir’s AQI is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered “unhealthy”, one ranging from 201 to 300 is categorised “very unhealthy”, and any figure above 301 is “hazardous”.
According to IQAir, the AQI readings for Lahore and Karachi were the highest recorded so far this month.

At 11am in Lahore, concentration of the pollutant PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — was measured at 158.8 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 31.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines.
PM2.5 level in Karachi was recorded 100 µg/m³, 20 times the WHO’s annual guideline value.
IQAir advised residents in Lahore and Karachi to avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
 
 

Smog is set to intensify across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.
In a bid to combat smog, the Punjab government started water sprinkling operations from Sunday night and activated anti-smog guns in the most affected areas.
In Lahore, these measures were deployed across the city, including Karim Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Multan Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara Flyover, GT Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, and Upper Mall.
Besides local pollutants, winds blowing from India are also likely to play a role in worsening the situation over the week.
Separately, the Lahore police said yesterday it arrested 83 people and registered 77 cases as part of its ongoing anti-smog operation.
Air pollution poses a hazardous risk to people’s health, with respiratory issues witnessing a spike during winter when smog intensifies. According to WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo, 256,000 people died in Pakistan every year due to air pollution.</p><small>2025-10-21 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21161351db2812c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950374/smog-theatre-will-cannons-and-towers-clear-polluted-air' target='_blank'><strong>‘Smog theatre’: Will cannons and towers clear polluted air?</strong></a><br><p>As Lahore gears up for another smog season, an imposing new fleet of green trucks is making rounds across the city. Branded as “Anti-Smog Guns”, they spray a fine mist into the air in hopes of settling pollution.
Launched under the banner of Climate Resilient Punjab, the fog cannons promise cleaner skies.
They look like action. Do they deliver?
The science says no. A 2023 study from China tracked air along a road segment before and after a mist cannon passed. PM2.5 rose by up to 13 per cent about 25–35 minutes later, as the extra water accelerated chemistry that formed more fine particles. In other words, the cannon didn’t clean the air. It primed the air to make more pollution.
In Lahore, each fog cannon costs over Rs45 million, according to news reports. The machines were imported from China and formally handed over to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a high-profile event attended by senior government leadership.
Running one unit continuously can consume up to 360,000 litres of water per day. Multiplied across 15 units (and possibly more to come), this represents a massive environmental and financial burden, especially in a water-stressed, smog-choked city.
The question then becomes: why invest in a solution that does not address the root causes of smog?
 
 

Lahore’s pollution comes from the familiar mix: exhaust from vehicles, industrial combustion, brick kilns, construction dust, open waste burning and seasonal crop fires.
Addressing these requires stronger regulation, cleaner fuels, public transit investments and regional coordination with the agricultural sector. Not atmospheric firefighting.
Yet smog cannons persist because they look like action. Their towering presence and dramatic spray offer visual reassurance, especially when political pressure mounts.
They are, in effect, optics over outcomes. A show of effort rather than a solution. They are, effectively, ‘smog theatre’.
Smog towers were last year’s spectacle. Installed with fanfare, they failed to dent Lahore’s ambient particulate matter, just as evaluations from experts warned they would. Different machine, same theatre.
 
 

Pakistan deserves better. Lahore deserves better. We need evidence-based air quality policy, not spectacles. The resources spent on fog cannons and smog towers would be far more effective if redirected toward emission controls, the release of real-time air quality data, cleaner fuels and public communication about air pollution risks.
The air doesn’t just need to look clean — it needs to be clean.
The true crisis runs much deeper. In 2024, Lahore had zero clean air days under World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.
 
 

Its annual average PM2.5 concentration was 104.6 microgrammes per cubic meter, more than three times the Punjab NEQS legal limit and 21 times the WHO guideline.
This level of exposure reduces average life expectancy by seven years. This is not a seasonal phenomenon. It is a systemic failure with multiple sources.
China’s success offers a better model. As Ma Jun writes in The Economics of Air Pollution in China, authorities began by developing detailed emissions inventories, conducting cost-benefit analyses and targeting specific polluting sectors with enforceable regulation.
This data-driven approach helped Beijing significantly reduce smog within a decade.
Pakistan can do the same.
But only if we stop misting the symptoms and start making policy around the causes.
We need rigorous enforcement of diesel vehicle standards, identification of key emitters through real-world emissions testing, industrial emission controls, brick kiln modernisation and investment in clean public transit.
Until we confront the sources of pollution head-on, no amount of mist will clear the air.</p><small>2025-10-21 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21155936511bc3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950360/26th-amendment-case-justice-mazhar-says-regular-constitutional-benches-branches-of-same-tree' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Justice Mazhar says regular, constitutional benches ‘branches of same tree’</strong></a><br><p>Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Tuesday remarked that the Supreme Court’s regular and constitutional benches (CBs) were “branches of one tree” as an eight-member CB heard arguments on petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
According to the cause list for today, the CB has taken up 37 petitions pertaining to the 26th Amendment.
 


The hearing
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, concluded his arguments today. Dr Adnan Khan, counsel for Mohammad Anas, also presented his contentions. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.

As Rizvi continued his arguments, Justice Mandokhail said, “Even if we accept your stance that the Supreme Court and the bench are separate, then this shows that the bench’s suo motu power is maintained but has been taken away from the Supreme Court.”
However, Rizvi replied that while the CB had been given some powers under the 26th Amendment, none were taken away from the apex court.
Referring to the provision that was introduced through the 26th Amendment, Justice Hilali observed, “The amendment has been made in the Constitution. Article 191A has come into existence and constitutional benches have been made under it.
“Now you are saying there should be a full bench. So will we need to go into the pre-Amendment era […] and suspend the 26th Amendment for it?” she asked, adding that how Article 191A can be “bypassed”.
Rizvi responded that Article 191A should be read in conjunction with other provisions, not on its own. He argued that Article 191A had not “ended the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3)” (original jurisdiction).
 
 

At this, Justice Mazhar observed that the powers under Article 184(3) had been transferred to the CB under Article 191A, adding that the latter provision “clearly mentioned” the same.
Rizvi then proceeded to cite several past judgments to support his arguments, adding that Article 191A should be read with Article 176, which provides the constitution of the SC.
The retired judge noted that despite having special powers, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) was a part of SC and could also use powers vested in the apex court under Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution.
He termed Article 187 a “helpful provision to enact complete justice”.
“The Constitutional Bench can also use powers provided under Article 187. The Constitutional Bench was also made within the Supreme Court, right?” Justice Mazhar said.
Justice Aminuddin remarked that the question at hand was not about the CB’s powers, but rather how to “make judges of non-constitutional benches” part of the CB.
Rizvi, echoing Sheikh’s arguments from yesterday, contended that the CB judges had two roles: “You are the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Bench as well.”
At this,  Justice Mazhar remarked, “Regular bench and Constitutional Bench, both are two branches of one tree. […] Nobody is saying it (CB) is not the Supreme Court, or above or below it.”
Justice Mandokhail wondered whether Rizvi meant that benches could not hear the case, but a full court had the powers to do so. Justice Mazhar pointed out that even in India, whose example Rizvi cited, cases before constitutional benches were not referred to regular ones.
He further noted that while the neighbouring country still had the concept of the chief justice being the “Master of the Roster”, Pakistan no longer had the same as committees had been formed to fix cases for hearing.
At one point, Rizvi suggested that the CB be considered a constitutional court. “This was being established as a constitutional court, but it became a constitutional bench,” he said, referring to the proposals mulled as part of the 26th Amendment last year.
“The advice you are giving is good,” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
“The confusion is that instead of ‘court’, the term ‘bench’ was used,” Rizvi said.
Recalling Rizvi’s and Sheikh’s requests for a full court comprising all 24 judges, Justice Mazhar observed, “Now we have to decide whether this Constitutional Bench has the power to form a full court of 24 judges or not.”
In response, the retired judge suggested that the CB was, after all, a bench of the apex court and could refer the matter to the CJP just as any regular bench could.
Here, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “Are you saying that we should give power to those judges who do not have it under the law?”
Addressing Rizvi,  Justice Mazhar said, “Tell us a way to circumvent Article 191A.”
Rizvi then suggested that the CB could refer the matter ahead, at which Justice Mazhar asked to whom. The petitioner replied that the CB would know this better, but the judge pointed out that the issue with forwarding the matter to the CJP was that he was not a part of the CB.
At one point, Justice Hilali corrected Rizvi, clarifying that “no one said we cannot do anything” about the 26th Amendment.
Upon Justice Mandokhail urging Rizvi to conclude his arguments soon, the latter said, “The Amendment that is in place does not have the sanctity [it should].”
After the retired judge completed his arguments, Adnan came to the rostrum and highlighted previous contentions about a bench and a full court being separate entities.

“A bench is constituted, whereas the full court is not. A bench is a part of the full court, while the full court is a permanent body,” the lawyer said.
The hearing witnessed some back and forth when Adnan contended that before the 2023 Practice and Procedure Act, the CJP could constitute benches, but there was no specific provision for forming full courts; rather, it was a convention.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether Adnan meant that a full court already existed and matters were to be simply referred there, whereas in the case of benches, benches were first constituted and then cases were fixed. The lawyer replied in the affirmative.
Justice Hilali wondered how the CB could “bypass” Article 191A to include all judges. Adnan replied that Article 191A only barred other benches from hearing constitutional cases but not the full court.
Justice Aminuddin observed that the bench had “absolutely no objection or reservation if the full court has the jurisdiction” to hear the case.
Adnan contended that both the CB and a full court could hear the 26th Amendment case, but precedence and the concept of “collective wisdom” favoured that the full court hear the case.
“Has this Amendment not blocked the path of convention?” Justice Hilali wondered. She asked the lawyer if he could suggest a “safe path through which the Constitutional Amendment could be bypassed and it would not be illegal either”.
At one point, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “Let’s also talk about this today. This matter is raised again and again. Tell us how many members there are in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and who they are.”
Adnan responded that the law minister was among the “many” members of the JCP, adding that the topic pertained to the arguments of the main case, and so it was inappropriate to discuss at this point.
 
 

“Look at our patience; we are continuously hearing lies while sitting here. Tell us what their dominant role is in the constitution of benches,” Justice Aminuddin quipped.
The counsel stated that he had no objection to any of the judges in the current CB, adding that “we have no role in the formation of constitutional benches”.
“Let the collective wisdom of the Supreme Court prevail over the collective wisdom of the parliament,” Adnan said, concluding his arguments.
The petitions
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan,  Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-21 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629726-sc-judges-warn-new-sjc-code-of-conduct-threatens-judicial-independence' target='_blank'><strong>SC judges warn new SJC code of conduct threatens 'judicial independence'</strong></a><br><p>

As the museum remained closed for a second day on Monday, officials said 60 investigators were working on the theory that an organised crime group was behind the raid in which nine pieces of jewellery were taken. A crown covered in more than 1,300 diamonds was dropped in the streets of Paris as the robbers fled.
Detectives scoured video camera footage from around the Louvre as well as from main highways out of Paris for signs of the four robbers who escaped on scooters on Sunday morning.
“There are a lot of videos, and this is one of the investigators’ lines of work,” said Interior Minister Laurent Nunez.
 


But as disappointed tourists rebooked tickets to the world’s most visited museum, the heist — which lasted just seven minutes —also reignited a row over the lack of security in French museums, after two other institutions were hit last month.
Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin admitted to security flaws at the Louvre.
“What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels, giving France a terrible image,” he told France Inter radio.
Nunez has ordered better protection around cultural sites, his advisers said.
A report by France’s Court of Auditors seen by AFP, covering 2019 to 2024, points to a “persistent” delay in security upgrades at the Louvre. Only a fourth of one wing was covered by video surveillance.
The thieves arrived at around 9:30am (12:30pm PKT) on Sunday, 30 minutes after the museum opened.
They parked a truck with an extendable ladder, like those used by movers, below the museum’s Apollo Gallery, clambering up and using cutting equipment to get through a window and open the display cases.
The world-famous institution, whose extensive collections include the Mona Lisa, may not open again until Wednesday, as it is usually shut on Tuesdays.
 


Queues of impatient visitors had snaked their way across the museum’s pyramid courtyard and under the tall arches of the main entrance gallery, hoping to get in on Monday.
US tourist Jesslyn Ehlers, 38, and her husband rushed to rebook their tickets.
“We’re just kind of disappointed. We’ve been planning this for a very long time,” she said.
Carol Fuchs, another US tourist, had been standing in line for more than three-quarters of an hour.
“The audacity, coming through a window,” she told AFP. “Will they ever be found? I doubt it. I think it’s long gone,” she said.
Diamonds, sapphires missing
The masked thieves dropped and damaged the crown of Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they made their escape. It is covered in 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, according to the museum’s website.
But eight priceless items of jewellery were taken, according to the culture ministry.
The list they released included an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his wife, Empress Marie-Louise.
 


Also stolen was a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which is dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds, and a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France. It is adorned with eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre’s website.
The loot would be impossible to sell on in its current state, said Alexandre Giquello, president of the auction house Drouot.
The raid — which saw some 2,000 people evacuated from the museum — is thought to have been carried out by an experienced team, possibly “foreigners”, Nunez has said.
The intervention of museum staff forced the thieves to flee, leaving behind some of the equipment used in the raid, the culture ministry said.
It was the first theft from the Louvre since 1998, when a painting by Camille Corot was stolen and never seen again.
France’s museums have previously come under criticism for poor security, with many viewed as being less secure than banks and seemingly increasingly targeted by thieves.
Last month, criminals broke into Paris’s Natural History Museum, making off with gold samples worth $700,000.
The same month, thieves stole two dishes and a vase from a museum in the central city of Limoges, the losses estimated at $7.6 million.</p><small>2025-10-21 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629720-sc-justice-mazhar-cites-indian-judiciarys-cb-during-26th-amendment-case-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>SC Justice Mazhar cites Indian judiciary's CB during 26th Amendment case hearing</strong></a><br><p>

The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.
The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today.
The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi.
During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance.
“We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said.
At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.”
He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.”
The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise.
For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea.
The ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application.
Veteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.
The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
‘Space for opposition getting narrower’
Speaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”.
“Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name.
Speaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.”
He also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said.
“The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-21 08:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21120215279af59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950354/liquor-and-arms-recovery-case-islamabad-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-gandapur-over-persistent-no-shows' target='_blank'><strong>Liquor and arms recovery case: Islamabad court issues arrest warrant for Gandapur over persistent no-shows</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions and court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur on a 2016 liquor and weapons recovery case over his continued absence from the proceedings.
Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court.
The hearing was adjourned till October 28.
The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2.
Gandapur had rejected police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025.</p><small>2025-10-21 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21074808f9a1034.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950292/aws-outage-cable-damage-leave-net-users-high-and-dry' target='_blank'><strong>AWS outage, cable damage leave net users high and dry</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As people around the world struggled with several popular apps due to a massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday, users in Pakistan expressed frustration after another alleged ‘cable fault’ degraded internet speeds on certain internet service providers (ISPs) in Karachi and across the country.
The widespread outage of Amazon’s cloud services unit took down many popular internet services, impacting streaming platforms, messaging services such as Reddit and Snapchat, and some banks and businesses.
Also affected were Amazon’s Shopping, Prime Video service and Disney+, as well as Perplexity AI, the Fortnite game, Airbnb, Duolingo, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and trading app Robinhood.
Mobile telephone services and messaging apps Signal and Whatsapp were also affected in Europe, according to Downdetector, a website monitoring internet problems. Some UK banks, such as Lloyd’s were also impacted, and pointed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the problem.
After few hours of disruptions, systems were gradually coming back online, with AWS saying it was seeing “significant signs of recovery” for some impacted services. AWS’s maintenance site said its engineers scrambled to fix the underlying DNS issue once they became aware of “increased error rates” hitting multiple services. More than four hours later, though some problems persisted, AWS said it was on the path “towards full recovery” and most of its operations were “succeeding normally”.
The DNS issue identified has to do with the Domain Name System protocol used on the internet to associate information with various domain names.
Although the DNS problem was “fully mitigated”, it caused a huge backlog of stymied requests that had to be worked through, AWS said.
‘Cable fault’
Meanwhile, internet users in Pakistan complained of service degradation and slow browsing speeds on certain ISPs, which was once again attributed to a fault in the submarine cable.
There was no statement or acknowledgement from the ISPs in question, the IT ministry, or the regulator, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority.
When approached for comment, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja attributed it to the global shutdown of Amazon cloud services. “Snapchat and other major apps [are] down due to Amazon web service outage worldwide,” she told Dawn.
However, many internet users claimed they had been informed by their ISP that services were suffering due to cable damage. Taking to X, digital expert Habibullah Khan claimed that the disruption was due to a fault in the PEACE cable.
“It’s a cable cut on the core system. They are running tests to localise the fault location,” he posted.
 






The PEACE cable system originates in China and connects to Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the cables landing in the country are operated by PTCL, Cybernet and TransWorld Associates.
Three undersea cable networks operated by the PTCL are AAE-1 (Africa, Asia and Europe), SMW4 (South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) and the IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe).

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest case of poliovirus was detected in a 12-month-old boy from Ghari union council in Torghar, marking the second case in the district this year.
“With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 30 – including 19 from KP, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” it said.
The statement added that during the month of September, the Pakistan Polio Programme collected 127 sewage samples across 87 districts in the country.
Of these, 81 samples tested negative for poliovirus, while 44 were found positive; two samples are currently under process in the laboratory, it added.
Balochistan reported 21 negative sample and two positive; Punjab reported 22 negative, 8 positive and one which was still under process; KP reported 24 negative and 10 positive; Sindh reported seven negative, 21 positive and one which was under process; Islamabad reported four negative and one positive; Azad Jammu and Kashmir reported three negative; and Gilgit-Baltistan reported one negative and one positive.
“While the overall trend indicates a decline in positive detections, reflecting the impact of recent high-quality vaccination campaigns, virus circulation persists in certain high-risk areas. These detections highlight the continued need for strong, targeted efforts to interrupt transmission,” the statement said.
It added that the Polio Eradication Initiative was intensifying efforts to sustain comprehensive vaccination coverage and ensure the “highest quality campaigns in vulnerable” areas.
The statement said that the fourth national polio vaccination campaign for 2025 was conducted last week, vaccinating over 44 million children, while the campaign in south KP was currently in progress.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-10-21 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21105239adba8c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950352/china-hawk-sanae-takaichi-named-japans-first-woman-prime-minister' target='_blank'><strong>China hawk Sanae Takaichi named Japan’s first woman prime minister</strong></a><br><p>Japan got its first woman prime minister on Tuesday after Sanae Takaichi, a China hawk and social conservative, forged an 11th-hour coalition deal.
Japan’s fifth premier in as many years will lead a minority government and has a full in-tray, not least a scheduled visit by US President Donald Trump next week.
Parliament appointed Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, as prime minister on Tuesday, after she unexpectedly won a majority in a first round of voting.
She will formally take office after meeting the emperor later.
 






The former heavy metal drummer became on October 4 head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed almost non-stop for decades but is losing support.
Six days later the Komeito party, uncomfortable about Takaichi’s conservative views and an LDP slush fund scandal, quit their coalition.
This forced Takaichi to form an alliance with the reformist, right-leaning Japan Innovation Party (JIP), which was signed on Monday evening.
JIP wants to lower the consumption tax rate on food to zero, to abolish corporate and organisational donations and to reduce the number of MPs.
Takaichi pledged on Monday to “make Japan’s economy stronger, and reshape Japan as a country that can be responsible for future generations”.
“She’s a strong-minded person, regardless of being a woman,” pensioner Toru Takahashi, 76, told AFP in Takaichi’s hometown Nara.
“She’s not like Trump. But she’s clear about what’s right and wrong.”
Nordic
Takaichi has promised a cabinet with “Nordic” levels of women, up from two under outgoing premier Shigeru Ishiba.
These could include the right-wing Satsuki Katayama in charge of finances and the half-American Kimi Onoda as economic security minister, local media said.
Japan ranked 118 out of 148 in the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. Around 15 per cent of lower house MPs are women and corporate boardrooms are overwhelmingly male.
Takaichi, 64, has said she hopes to raise awareness about women’s health struggles and has spoken candidly about her own experience with menopause.
But she opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to share the same surname, and wants the imperial family to stick to male-only succession.
In Nara, company worker Keiko Yoshida, 39, told AFP she hopes Takaichi will “make Japan a more liveable place for women”.
“I’d be happy if we saw more policies from a woman’s perspective: support for childcare, and help for women returning to work after having children,” agreed student Nina Terao, 18.
Abenomics
Details of a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo remain unresolved, and Trump also wants Japan to stop Russian energy imports and boost defence spending.
“I’d like her to be a prime minister who can clearly say ‘No’ when needed,” Satoshi Sakamoto, 73, another Nara pensioner, told AFP.
Beyond Trump, Takaichi’s many challenges include reversing the decline of Japan’s population and injecting some vim in the flatlining economy.
Being in a minority in both houses of parliament, the new coalition will need support from other parties to push through legislation.
Takaichi has in the past backed aggressive monetary easing and expanded government spending, echoing her mentor, former premier Shinzo Abe.
Despite walking back on these “Abenomics” calls in the LDP leadership contest, her victory has boosted Japanese stocks to record highs.
She previously said that “Japan is completely looked down on by China”, and that Tokyo must “address the security threat” posed by Beijing.
But she has since toned down her rhetoric on China, and stayed away last week from a festival at the Yasukuni shrine — she has been a regular visitor before — honouring Japan’s war dead.
Takaichi will also be under pressure to restore the fortunes of the LDP after a string of poor election results that cost Ishiba his job.
Smaller parties gaining support include the populist Sanseito, which calls immigration a “silent invasion”.
“Prices have gone up, and it’s tough,” Nara pensioner Satoe Tominaga, 77, told AFP, saying she was “50-50” about Takaichi.

As they met at the White House for their first summit, Trump said the deal had been negotiated over four or five months. Albanese described it as an $8.5 billion pipeline “that we have ready to go.”
The full terms of the agreement were not immediately available. The two leaders said part of the agreement had to do with processing of the minerals. Albanese said both countries will contribute $1 billion over the next six months for joint projects.
 






The United States has been looking for access to rare earths and critical minerals around the world as China tightens control over global supply. China has the world’s largest rare earths reserves, according to US Geological Survey data, but Australia also has significant reserves.
The two leaders also planned to discuss the $239.46 billion AUKUS agreement, reached in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden, in which Australia is to buy US nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 before building a new submarine class with Britain.
Navy Secretary John Phelan told the meeting the United States and Australia were working very closely to improve the original AUKUS framework for all three parties “and clarify some of the ambiguity that was in the prior agreement.” Trump said these were “just minor details.” “There shouldn’t be any more clarifications, because we’re just, we’re just going now full steam ahead, building,” Trump said.
Australian officials have said they are confident AUKUS will proceed, with Defence Minister Richard Marles last week saying he knew when the review would conclude.
Cooperative and warm relationship
Ahead of Monday’s meeting between the two leaders, Australian officials have emphasized Canberra is paying its way under AUKUS, contributing $2 billion this year to boost production rates at US submarine shipyards, and preparing to maintain US Virginia-class submarines at its Indian Ocean naval base from 2027.
The delay of 10 months in an official meeting since Trump took office has caused some anxiety in Australia as the Pentagon urged Canberra to lift defence spending. The two leaders met briefly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.
Australia is willing to sell shares in its planned strategic reserve of critical minerals to allies including Britain, Reuters reported last month, as Western governments scramble to end their reliance on China for rare earths and minor metals. Top US officials last week condemned Beijing’s expansion of rare earth export controls as a threat to global supply chains. China is the world’s biggest producer of the materials that are vital materials for products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.
Resource-rich Australia, wanting to extract and process rare earths, put preferential access to its strategic reserve on the table in US trade negotiations in April.
Ties with China
The United States has a large trade surplus with Australia, which is among the countries with the lowest US tariff.
Australia’s biggest trade partner is China, with exports of iron ore and coal long underpinning its national budget, despite efforts by Albanese’s government to diversify export markets after Beijing’s $20 billion boycott of Australian agriculture and coal from 2020 to 2023.

“A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here.
The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail.
 


He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.

Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province

Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case before the people to devise the future course of action.
He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors.
“Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors.
The chief minister said his government welcomed peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder.
He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader.
Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province.
He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP.
“Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said.
The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front.
“The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said.
Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee.
Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province.
“The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said.
The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances.
He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran.
Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up.
Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.”
He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive.
”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said.
Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public.
MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns.
The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason.
“The Katlang area where a drone strike was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said.
Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts.
He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found.
“We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said.
The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of KP’s mines and minerals and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights.
The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel.
The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday).

Speaking to a private TV channel, Mr Asif indicated progress in discus­­s­i­ons with American aviation authorities.
“Hopefully, permission will be granted soon,” he said, adding that the government is working on meeting international standards and enhancing safety protocols, which could lead to expanded global routes.
A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) spokesman highlighted the significance of US routes for PIA, emphasising the strong demand for non-stop flights from Pakistanis living in North America.

National flag carrier, Etihad enter into codeshare agreement

According to an aviation expert, a team from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recently visited Pakistan to conduct a safety audit.
 
 

A positive outcome from these audits could result in PIA achieving Category 1 status from the FAA, which is crucial for the resumption of direct flights to the US.
PIA codeshare with Etihad
Meanwhile, PIA announced on Monday it has entered into a codeshare agreement with UAE’s Etihad Airways.
The partnership, set to take effect from Oct 31, will extend to cargo services and frequent flyer programmes.
“This agreement marks a milestone for PIA,” a spokesperson said, adding that it will encompass passenger flights as well. The arrangement will primarily benefit routes not directly serviced by PIA, allowing passengers access to Etihad’s expansive network.
The codeshare is expected to enhance PIA’s service offerings and contribute to increased revenue, the spokesperson noted.

The groundbreaking ruling has strengthened protections for wor­k­ing women across the country.
The order came in response to a complaint filed by Ms. Zainab Zahrah Awan, who was terminated in April 2024 while on duly sanctioned maternity leave.
The Ombudsperson ruled that such termination not only viola­tes the Protection against Har­as­sment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, but also breaches fundamental constitutional rights — including dignity, equality, and protection of motherhood — guaranteed under Articles 14, 25, and 37 of the Constitution.

No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood, ombudsperson rules

FOSPAH directed that Rs800,000 be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs200,000 deposited into the national treasury, declaring the termination letter null and void and restoring the complainant’s employment status.
 
 

In her detailed judgement, the Om­­budsperson emphasised that maternity protections are non-negotiable and inviolable rights, reinforced by Pakistan’s commitments under international instruments such as CEDAW, ICESCR, and ILO conventions.
“Safe motherhood is not a favour — it is a fundamental right,” the order stated, adding, “No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood.”
The Ombudsperson reaffirmed that all employers must uphold women’s dignity and equality at the workplace.
The decision sets a significant precedent for women’s workplace rights in Pakistan, underscoring that any termination during maternity leave is unlawful and amounts to gender-based discrimination.

The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press.
Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down.
 
 

Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects.

Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed

Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded.
Two killed in Swabi
Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred.
According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers.
“The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.
Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police.
Attack repelled
Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building.
“But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee.
The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack.
 
 

Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

• Stakeholders say malpractice has pushed textile mills towards costly imports, deepening financial woes
• Investigators allege armed men assault PCGA team 
LAHORE: A startling case of large-scale cotton adulteration has surfaced in Sindh, where a ginning factory in Tando Adam was allegedly found mixing cotton waste into high-grade lint to produce what industry insiders are calling “burger cotton.”
According to reports, a four-member monitoring team of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) — formed to curb such malpractice — raided the factory after receiving credible complaints. However, the operation turned violent when the factory owner allegedly summoned nearly a hundred armed men who assaulted and detained the visiting committee members for several hours on Sunday.
The incident has sent shockwaves through the cotton ginning industry nationwide. In protest, an emergency meeting of the PCGA’s monitoring committee and Sindh-based ginners was convened in Tando Adam, where participants resolved to register an FIR against the factory management after the Diwali holidays.
Some ginners in collusion with textile mill representatives and laboratory staff, had been blending cotton waste into lint bales — a practice that has steadily eroded the quality of Pakistani cotton – for several years. This malpractice has discouraged textile mills from purchasing domestic cotton, pushing them instead towards costly foreign imports and deepening the industry’s financial crisis.
Ahead of the cotton year 2025-26, the PCGA had decided to expose such “black sheep” in the sector. Separate monitoring committees were set up for Punjab and Sindh with the authority to inspect ginning factories and take disciplinary action against violators.
The Sindh monitoring committee, led by well-known ginner Ramesh Lal, had already inspected several units since May. While a few factories were earlier found involved in adulteration and warned, no fresh complaints had surfaced until recently. Following renewed reports from textile buyers, a four-member team — comprising Haji Liaquat Ali Laskani, Seth Gopal Das, Seth Kishan Chand, and Seth Jay Dada — conducted a surprise raid on the Tando Adam factory.
According to the investigators, they discovered that three ginning units were operating within a single compound, where workers were pressing bales in a sophisticated manner — filling the outer layers with premium lint while packing the inner cores with cheap cotton waste. This ensured that laboratory samples taken from the surface appeared to meet quality standards.
As the committee members attempted to enter the facility, they reportedly faced stiff resistance. The factory owner called in over a hundred armed men, who beat and threatened the PCGA team at gunpoint before releasing them after considerable delay. Sources said heaps of cotton waste were seen openly being mixed into lint during the raid.
Ihsanul Haq, a representatives of the ginning industry said such adulterated lint, nicknamed “burger cotton” in Sindh, was being produced and sold at high prices with the alleged connivance of ginning owners, textile mill procurement agents, and lab staff — allowing all parties to profit while damaging the reputation of Pakistani cotton exports.
In the wake of the attack on the PCGA team, the PCGA monitoring committee and Sindh ginners held an emergency session in Tando Adam on Sunday evening, chaired by senior members of the association, to review the situation and finalise legal and disciplinary measures against those involved.
The meeting decided that All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) officials and major textile groups would be immediately informed about the reported mixing of cotton waste in the said ginning factory. Another meeting of cotton ginners was scheduled for Thursday, after the Diwali holidays, to formulate a strategy for strict disciplinary action against the concerned cotton ginner and to seek a ban on factories mixing cotton waste with quality lint.
The meeting further resolved to urge textile mill owners to dismiss those selectors and laboratory staff who, in collusion with ginning factory owners, blend cotton waste into quality lint. Participants stressed that producing high-quality cotton domestically would help significantly boost the country’s exports.
The association has also demanded immediate government protection for its inspection teams and a nationwide crackdown on adulterated lint production to safeguard the integrity of Pakistan’s cotton industry — a sector already struggling to maintain competitiveness in the international textile market.
