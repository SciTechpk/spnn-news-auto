This evolving challenge requires a clear and adaptive strategy to effectively counter it.
These operations, which Delhi has designed to stay below the nuclear threshold, have manifested the shrinking space in which our deterrence operates in the highly volatile South Asian environment. The time has come to rethink and update our understanding of deterrence — one that reflects the realities of today, where conflict no longer arrives with armies massing at borders, but with drones in the sky and missiles that strike and disappear before the world has time to respond.
On May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor” — a coordinated assault involving air strikes, drone swarms, and missile attacks deep inside Pakistani territory. The strikes hit a disturbing range of targets from religious institutions like mosques to strategic military installations. Pakistani armed forces that follow a “quid pro quo plus” policy with regards to India, responded robustly and swiftly, downing multiple Indian aircraft — including Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets in a short span of less than an hour — employing stand-off weapons and air defence systems to signal its resolve.
But instead of de-escalating, India escalated further.

Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus aims at preventing all-out conflicts, but India’s reckless behaviour to expand geographic scope of its strikes risks miscalculation resulting in a nuclear catastrophe

By the next morning, a wave of drones swarmed Pakistani skies, followed a day later by fresh missile attacks on airbases. It was a moment of real danger. The international community scrambled to contain what was quickly becoming a runaway crisis. Deterrence, while not broken, was undeniably shaken.
 
 

India’s willingness to act and expand geographic scope of its strikes, echoing Uri in 2016 and Pulwama-Balakot in 2019, points to a gap in Pakistan’s ability to deter reckless Indian behaviour due to emergence of newer technologies. To put it simply, Pakistan’s shield is holding, though it may be fraying at the edges.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme, born from the trauma of 1971, was built on a simple promise: to make any future aggression against the country unthinkable. Between 1998 and 2015, that promise largely held. Even during moments of extreme tension like the Kargil crisis of 1999, months-long military standoff in 2002 or the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, India refrained from crossing the Line of Control and the international border or undertaking major strike in Pakistani heartland. But that calculus began to shift post-2015 especially following the Gurdaspur attack barely weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif at Ufa. First came the claimed “surgical strikes”, then the 2019 aerial incursion following Pulwama.
“South Asia has neither crisis stability nor arms race stability. While I do not expect a crisis for some time — perhaps several years — the region remains unstable and dangerous,” said Chris­to­­pher Clary, a security aff­airs expert at the University at Albany, the US.
The May 2025 clash — an intense 88-hour exchange of air strikes, drones, and missile fire — marked a deeper evolution of this trend of a rapid escalation under the nuclear overhang. It laid bare a dangerous new reality: India believes it can operate in a “grey zone” just below the nuclear threshold, using limited, precise force to impose costs without triggering all-out war. Indian leaders appear beholden to the idea that they can hit Pakistan without provoking an uncontrollable escalation. From Uri to Balakot, and now Pahalgam, the visible trend is that each strike is a calculated test of Pakistani resolve, and each one pushes the boundaries a little further.
Pakistan’s “quid pro quo plus” policy, adopted after 2016, meant to meet Indian aggression with a harder blow, aimed to slam this door of a military conflict below nuclear rung shut. But three incidents in nine years show Pakistani “plus” isn’t scaring India enough. The policy’s success is bittersweet: it prevents all-out conflict, but India does exploit some space to commit aggression.
Elizabeth Threlkeld, director for South Asia at the Stimson Center, the US, agrees “the limitations of Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus approach are becoming more visible in light of India’s increasing willingness to engage in limited conventional actions.”
Misstep towards catastrophe
Each Indian operation is designed to normalise limited raids in the eyes of the world. If this continues, and strikes on mainland Pakistan are repeated, it would increase the risk of a misstep towards nuclear catastrophe as each crisis raises the stakes. Getting an opportunity to dump the payload on a Balakot hill in 2019 gave way to mainland strikes in 2025, setting a higher baseline for the next clash. A more worrying aspect is that if this cycle will persist, each round will compress decision making windows in a world of hypersonic weapons.
India’s playbook is clear: use modern technology — drones, standoff missiles — to inflict pain while staying below nuclear tripwires. Modi is therefore attempting, at least on his part, to rewrite the rules, projecting strength to domestic audiences and signalling that Pakistan’s nuclear shadow won’t paralyse India. Whispers of pre-emptive counterforce strategies, meanwhile, have in the past few years circulated with growing frequency, though such a gamble remains improbable.
“In March 2022, an Indian BrahMos missile landed in Mian Channu. Delhi called it an error, Pakistani leadership accepted the explanation, but I saw it as a deliberate test of our defences, including our response time. BrahMos is central to India’s pre-emptive strike plans, its speed and precision leave little time to respond, making such incidents dangerously destabilising for Pakistan,” Dr Shireen Mazari, who was a federal minister in 2022, said, alluding to the debates within the system at that time.
India’s confidence in multi-domain warfare, blending crewed and uncrewed platforms, creates a false sense of control, as if escalation can be neatly managed.
The proponents of such an approach forget that wars don’t always proceed as per calculated decisions, rather they often unravel through confusion.
A single misstep, like a missile or an artillery piece gone astray or a misunderstood signal, can unravel restraint and push a tense standoff into full-blown catastrophe.
What makes it scarier in Indian case is that the extremist Hindutva mindset currently dominating New Delhi and electoral pressures push the government to demonstrate strength through limited strikes, confident they can avoid nuclear escalation. This dynamic perpetuates the very crises their leaders must manage.
“The very presence of recurring conventional engagements highlights the precariousness of the situation, where misperceptions of red lines could lead to inadvertent escalation between the two nuclear-armed adversaries,” Threlkeld maintained.
Deception or internal dysfunction?
Following India’s aerial strikes on the morning of May 7 and Pakistan’s forceful retaliation, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval conveyed messages through international intermediaries indicating that New Delhi wanted to de-escalate. But to Islamabad’s surprise, shortly after it received these signals, Pakistan’s airspace was swarmed by hostile drones. Whether this was a deliberate act of deception or a sign of internal dysfunction within the Indian system remains unclear. However, one plausible explanation is that hardliners within India’s security establishment pressured the military to climb the next rung of the escalation ladder — targeting Pakistani military installations with unmanned platforms, despite diplomatic overtures suggesting restraint.
In this scenario, Pakistan faces a stark choice: continue pursuing a doctrine that punishes India after the incident or forge one that stops India cold.
First, there is a need to strengthen our conventional arsenal, which includes acquisition of modern fighter jets, advanced air defences, rapid-response units, and precision munitions, to make limited strikes too costly. Second, ambiguity, using cyber-attacks, economic pressure, or international legal action to raise India’s costs without nuclear risks, should be embraced. The ‘catalytic posture’, which involves signalling nuclear readiness to draw international mediation has worked well so far in South Asian environment, but its overuse risks diminishing returns.
Dr Adil Sultan, a dean at the Air University and a former SPD official, while explaining his vision of next generation of deterrence, said, “The future conflict is likely to be more intense, complex, and short, thus requiring quick response through ‘multi-domain integration’ (MDI) of all three services, and ground and space-based assets, with PAF being in the lead due to its inherent agility and capacity to act in a shortest possible time with maximum effect.”
Pakistan should also re-emphasise red lines through robust crisis channels especially after the targeting of the airbases.
So here we are back, 27 years later, on the same razor’s edge — thanks to the technological advancement. The nuclear bombs remain the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but every knife-edge attack or missile/drone strike cannot be stopped. The nukes can only promise that if the worst comes, both sides will pay an unthinkable price.

A.T.M. Azharul Islam, from the Jamaat-i-Islami party, and who has been in custody since 2012, was acquitted of crimes against humanity by the Supreme Court, which ordered his release.
Azharul Islam, who was born in 1952, was among six senior political leaders convicted during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year-long autocratic rule as prime minister ended in August 2024 when a student-led revolt forced her to flee.
Political parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami, are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
Islam’s lawyer Shishir Monir said he was “fortunate” because the five other senior political leaders who had been convicted — four from Jamaat-i-Islami, and another from the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP) — had already been hanged.
“He got justice because he is alive”, Monir told reporters. “The appellate division failed to review the evidence in other cases for crimes against humanity.”
Azharul Islam had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during the 1971 military operation.
Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
Azharul Islam appealed in 2015, but the court upheld the verdict in 2019, and he filed a review petition in 2020.
Hasina, 77, fled to India last year as crowds stormed her palace, and she remains there in exile.

• Babusar Top receives heavy snow; authorities say extreme conditions likely to persist through May 31
ISLAMABAD: Seven people were killed and over two dozen others sustained injuries on Tuesday as severe rain and windstorms swept through parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other  infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others  injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and KP on Saturday.
On Tuesday, two people were killed and around 20 injured after a thunderstorm swept through various parts of Punjab. The storm, accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, caused widespread destruction.
According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and dust storm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur Road near Ghazi Interchange in Attock, which resulted in the death of one passenger and left five others injured.
Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in Rehmo village of Attock district.  Also, a 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the same area. An 11-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house in Saghirabad area of Attock collapsed.
According to the Rescue 1122’s provincial headquarters, a man was killed after lightning struck him in Mianwali’s Kalabagh.
The district experienced multiple emergencies including a wall collapse that left one person injured at the Makkharwal police station and a falling solar panel that inju­red another resident.
In Gujran­wala, a young girl fell from roof due to powerful gusts.
In Taunsa Sharif, a woman was injured when the wall of her house collapsed.
Three people, including two children, were inj­ured in Rawalpindi as gusty winds battered the garrison city in the afternoon.
According to the PDMA, these ext­r­eme conditions are likely to persist through May 31, with upper and central Punjab districts inc­luding Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, facing the highest risk.
Two killed in KP
In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, two people lost their lives and another 10 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents.
Rains lashed many areas of the province, leaving several people injured.
A child died while four others were injured in a roof collapse incident in Swabi. Another person died and three members of the same family were injured in a lightning strike in Shangla district. In the Mattani area of the provincial capital, three persons were injured when the roof of their house collapsed, while another one was injured in another rain-related incident in the Badershi area of Nowshera district.
The upper parts of the Hazara division on Tuesday received heavy downpour and snowfall, blocking the Karakoram Highway to all sorts of traffic at two locations in the Lower Kohistan.
“The floodwater carrying heavy rocks and stones from nearby mountains blocked the Karakoram Highway at two points in our district,” Mohammad Duraj, an official from Rescue 1122, Lower Kohistan, told reporters. Babusar Top, the highest point in the Kaghan Valley, received heavy snowfall, significantly dropping temperatures across the district.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in a statement issued here said that the spell will continue till May 30. It said the rain caused widespread damage to the crops.
PDMA said wheat, vegetables and fruit crops were badly damaged in Mardan and its surrounding areas due to the hailstorm. Besides, rains also disrupted the power supply across the province as 113 of Peshawar Electric Supply Company tripped due to rain and thunderstorm.
Three killed in AJK
In Kashmir, three women lost their lives and a man went missing while several properties were damaged after a “cloudburst-induced flood” wreaked havoc in a suburban area of Muzaffarabad on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that the “cloudburst” triggered a flood in a water channel in Balgran village, located around 35 kilometres from Muzaffarabad on the right bank of the Neelum River, at about 4pm.
Among the victims were Zaiwar Jan, 75, and her daughter Shireen Bibi, 35, who died when the raging current swept into their house and filled it with mud.
Station House Officer (SHO) of Panjgran Iftikhar Awan, who spoke to Dawn from the affected village, said the mother’s body was recovered immediately, while the daughter’s body was later pulled from the debris.
In another severely affected house nearby, rescuers found 35-year-old Gori Bibi critically injured and unconscious. She was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Patikka, where she succumbed to her injuries later in the evening.
 
 

Gori Bibi’s father, 65-year-old Jalal Deen, was reported missing.
“We have been trying to locate him, but to no avail,” said SHO Awan.
Videos shared by residents showed muddy water gushing through the ground floor of the village’s main mosque, which was built almost along the course of the water channel, where water flow is usually minimal. According to SHO Awan, the flood, which lasted for about half an hour, completely destroyed the mosque.
Mr Qureshi from the SDMA said initial assessments indicated partial damage to 20–25 houses and the mosque. However, SHO Awan feared that the figure could be higher. “At the moment, our priority is to assess the human losses. Material damages will be evaluated in daylight on Wednesday,” he said.
Separately, in Islamabad, the district administration decided to move billboards out of the city after a hoarding fixed at the National Press Club collapsed due to a windstorm that had also uprooted several trees.

Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Aleema claimed that court cases involving her brother were being manipulated, and that petitions were being removed from cause lists under pressure.
“I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said.
“They should tell us what Imran has done to them. Instead of fearing Imran and his sisters, they should speak to me directly.”
She further alleged that these hidden elements were exerting undue influence on judges and parliamentarians, calling for transparency and direct dialogue.
Later, she attempted to meet her brother at Adiala Jail but was denied access, though her two other sisters and several lawyers were granted a meeting.
In a separate media talk in the neighbouring garrison city, Aleema Khan questioned Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Barrister Gohar Ali Khan over his repeated claims that Imran Khan would be released before Eidul Azha, which will fall on June 7. “If he has good news, he should share it with party workers,” she said.
She said the PTI was preparing for massive nationwide protests, while clarifying that Imran Khan had no plans to summon workers to Islamabad because he was aware that “snipers are stationed in the capital to target them”.
She stressed that Mr Khan had clearly said he could spend the rest of his life in jail if it was in the country’s best interest.
Gandapur criticises federal govt
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Min­ister Ali Amin Gand­apur, standing alongside her, criticised the federal government and judiciary, blaming the 26th Amend­ment for the current political instability.
He claimed that the amendment had worsened the situation and vowed to repeal it once his party returned to power.
Mr Gandapur reiterated that the Feb 8 general elections were rigged and that PTI’s mandate was ‘stolen’. “There is no case against Imran Khan, and there is no justification for keeping him behind bars,” he said.

By late afternoon, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, after an almost three-month-old Israeli blockade of the devastated enclave.
In Rafah, which is under full Israeli army control, thousands of people, including women and children, some on foot or in donkey carts, flocked towards one of the distribution sites to receive food packages.
Videos showed lines of people walking through a wired-off corridor and into a large open field where aid was stacked. Later, images shared on social media showed large parts of the fence torn down as people jostled their way onto the site.

Private relief agency’s closeness to US and Israel’s endorsement of its distribution method have raised doubts about its neutrality

Hamas denies accusation
“The real cause of the delay and collapse in the aid distribution process is the tragic chaos caused by the mismanagement of the same company operating under the Israeli occupation administration in those buffer zones,” Ismail Al Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said.
The Israel military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that control was re-established.
A UN spokesperson called images of the incident “heartbreaking”.
Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein wrote on X that 8,000 “food packages” were delivered to Pale­stinians on Tuesday, the first day of what he described as an American initiative.
 






Screening procedures
Although the aid was available on Monday, Palestinians appeared to have heeded warnings, including from Hamas, about biometric screening procedures employed at the foundation’s aid distribution sites.
“As much as I want to go because I am hungry and my children are hungry, I am afraid,” said Abu Ahmed, 55. “I am so scared because they said the company belongs to Israel and is a mercenary, and also because the resistance (Hamas) said not to go,” he said in a message on WhatsApp.
The Israeli military said four aid sites have been established in recent weeks across the enclave, and that two of them in the area of Rafah began operations on Tuesday and “are distributing food packages to thousands of families in Gaza Strip”.
Israeli officials said one of the advantages of the new aid system is the opportunity to screen recipients to exclude anyone found to be connected with Hamas.
Humanitarian groups briefed on GHF’s plans say anyone accessing aid will have to submit to facial recognition technology that many Palestinians fear will end up in Israeli hands to be used to track and potentially target them.
Aid groups boycott GHF
The United Nations and other international aid groups have boycotted the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which they say undermines the principle that aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict, based on need.
“Humanitarian assistance must not be politicised or militarised,” said Christian Cardon, chief spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters the UN has a sound plan “to get aid to a desperate population” and that Israel was allowing it to deliver relief, but with a lot of obstacles.

• Meets commercial banks, regulators, industry bodies to gather input for budget
• Stakeholders agree incentives must make digital payments more appealing than cash
• Ceramic tile manufacturers say import dependence cut from 74pc to 4pc
• New digital financing model being developed to support small-scale farmers
ISLAMABAD: As part of pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and documented sector to others through digitisation, and hinted at major steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
A Ministry of Finance team, led by the minister, had a series of meetings with commercial banks, development financial institutions, regulators and industrial representatives, including ceramics manufacturers and steel producers, to discuss policy measures for inclusion in the next year’s federal budget.
 
 

Some of the proposals finalised during these meetings are believed to be strategic in nature to capture most of the undocumented economy through digitisation, including additional tax measures on cash transactions, incentives on digital payments and outrightly blocking cash payments in certain critical sectors to be identified by the Federal Board of Revenue with the support of Karandaaz, the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited and the banking sector.
One of the meetings on accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy finalised a host of measures for inclusion in the federal budget to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity.
The meeting decided to fine-tune measures for the budget given the fact that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions.
The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms, according to a statement.
The meeting agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses.
The importance of imp­r­oving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was taken as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.
The finance minister believed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth.
“Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,” he said.
Engagements with industry
In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed.
The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy. The ceramic tiles manufacturers reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China. They said the industry has reduced import dependency from 74pc to just 4pc and now relies almost entirely on local raw materials and labour.
The minister also assured the delegation that reforms in the energy sector were a top policy priority and envisaged a series of measures aimed at improving affordability, ensuring reliability, and moving towards a more efficient and targeted energy pricing structure.
He also pledged to simplify regulatory procedures, reduce compliance burden, and create a stable and predictable policy environment to attract further investment.
Credit access for small farmers
The finance minister also chaired a meeting of the Task Force on National Initiative to Unlock Un-Collateralised Credit for Small Farmers Through Tech-Driven Solutions. He reviewed the recommendations for the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, aimed at unlocking uncollateralised financing for small-scale farmers through innovative, technology-based solutions and enhanced access to credit.
The proposed scheme would employ an end-to-end digital process to ensure transparency, efficiency, and a seamless customer experience.
Designed as a federal programme with nationwide coverage, the initiative aims to align provincial and national efforts to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and contribute meaningfully to GDP growth through inclusive agri-development.
A revised scorecard was presented by the task force with a greater emphasis on agronomic factors — raising the weightage of agronomy from 40pc to 60pc — while maintaining a 40pc weight on financial indicators, thereby rebalancing priorities to better reflect the realities of smallholder farming.
The prototype scheme, developed by the Ministry of Finance’s Task Force on Access to Finance, calls for a multi-bank and microfinance institution (MFI) delivery model implemented through a unified methodology, ensuring wide outreach and operational standardisation across financial institutions.
It was decided to make the entire process time-bound and action-oriented to achieve lasting impact and then replicate a parallel, tech-supported model for the dairy and livestock segment, as most smallholder farmers maintain herds but faced difficulties in securing financing for livestock acquisition, maintenance, and dairy product marketing.
The delegation of Large Steel Producers raised critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistencies, and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field.
The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy.
“We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.

An incident report issued by the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana mentioned a “drone attack” at 8pm, which injured 22 people aged between 13 and 60 years.
The condition of a 13-year-old and a man was listed as “serious”, and they were referred to “tertiary care”. Seven, including three aged 15, 18 and 19 years, had “major” injuries. The rest of the 13 had “minor” injuries, of which two were discharged.
PTI-affiliated MNA Zubair Khan Wazir echoed the hospital’s tally and told Dawn.com, “The young men were playing volleyball when the quadcopter fired shells on them.”
He added that people in the area were “scared and restricted to their homes after the attack”.
Wazir, in a post on Facebook, strongly condemned the “drone attack in which innocent citizens were targeted”. He demanded that the federal government and the relevant institutions “immediately investigate the incident, provide justice to the affected families, and take immediate and effective steps to prevent such attacks in the future”.
“Targeting common people under the guise of an attack on a Taliban post is extremely regrettable, shameful and unacceptable,” Wazir claimed, terming the incident a “part of a heinous conspiracy to sabotage regional peace”.
The incident comes within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing today that they had ended their protest after reaching an agreement with the local administration.</p><small>2025-05-27 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28001001a558984.png?r=001040' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657/pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-grow-ties-through-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan vow to grow ties through investment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues, Radio Pakistan reported.
The development came as the premier met with President Aliyev after landing in Azerbaijan’s Lachin District earlier today as he continued his four-nation tour to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.
Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to Turkiye and Iran, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.
In their meeting today, PM Shehbaz and Aliyev reviewed the “full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation” between their countries, Radio Pakistan stated.
The prime minister thanked Aliyev’s country for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and “acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan”. Earlier this month, Aliyev had congratulated Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s “remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
He noted that the people of Azerbaijan “celebrated the success of Pakistan in Marka-i-Haq against India”, referring to the Pakistan armed forces’ response to Indian aggression.
A video shared by the government showed President Aliyev greeting the premier with a hug and the two sharing an energetic handshake.
 






The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding progress in its investment in Pakistan, with delegation-level talks to be organised “very soon”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The prime minister reiterated that both countries had stood by each other on every occasion and would continue to do so. He also conveyed his warm felicitations to Aliyev and his nation ahead of the Azerbaijan Republic Day tomorrow.
The two leaders underscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity and principled positions on key international issues, the report added.
The meeting concluded with both leaders reaffirming their commitment to the deepening of the Pakistan-Azerbaijan partnership and working closely to further advance shared objectives at the bilateral and regional levels.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi were also present during the meeting, according to a post on the government’s official X account. Dar, Tarar and Fatemi have been accompanying Shehbaz on the four-nation tour.
 






The leaders also met over a luncheon, according to the government.
“Unity and brotherhood — in the end, that’s all what matters!” posted Dar on his X account. He also shared a video showing glimpses of Aliyev and the Pakistani top leadership having a cordial conversation.
 






Upon his arrival in Lachin, PM Shehbaz was received by FM Jeyhun Bayramov, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other diplomatic staff, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported, citing a PM Office press release.
The prime minister is set to attend the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Aliyev, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






In Istanbul, Shehbaz and Erdogan had “reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. In Tehran, the premier expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing issues, including Kashmir and water security.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, the Foreign Office had said earlier.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
COAS Munir, Iran counterpart discuss strengthening defence ties
Separately, COAS Munir, who also visited Istanbul and Tehran alongside PM Shehbaz, met with his Iranian counterpart Major General Mohammad Bagheri.
Gen Munir met with Bagheri at the General Staff Headquarters in Tehran, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release today.
The two military leaders engaged in discussions on the “evolving regional security landscape, with particular focus on strengthening bilateral defence ties”, the ISPR said.

“Key areas of mutual interest included enhancing military-to-military cooperation, improving security mechanisms along the shared border, and exploring avenues for transforming the border regions into zones of trade and economic connectivity, thereby contributing to regional stability and prosperity.”
COAS Munir was “accorded a warm welcome upon his arrival, including a ceremonial guard of honour presented by a well-turned-out contingent of the Iranian Armed Forces”, the statement added.
The ISPR stated that COAS Munir was on an official visit to Türkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan — three of the countries on Shehbaz’s itinerary.
The army chief, alongside PM Shehbaz, yesterday met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was also present during the meeting, according to state-run PTV News.
Support from friendly countries
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p><small>2025-05-27 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606524-aleemas-give-and-take-offer-can-be-considered-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema's ‘give and take' offer can be considered: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The monsoon season wreaks havoc in the metropolis every year as the drains become clogged causing them to overflow.
According to a notification issued by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, the ban was imposed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The notification said that throwing waste into the drains “causes serious environmental hazards, discharge of less water, choking of nullahs and a major cause of blockage of the nullahs during the monsoon season”.
 
 

It further said that this “warrants immediate action” to impose the ban “to prevent [the] throwing of garbage, solid waste and dumping of debris and other materials into the nullahs”, barring the people from the above actions.
The order also authorised the police to register complaints against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In March, the Karachi administration imposed a similar ban on the dumping of garbage and solid waste debris in drains for two months. The commissioner had said that all private, public and autonomous institutions had been urged to play their due role in improving the city’s sanitation conditions.
KPT issues monsoon alert
Separately, the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) issued an alert on precautionary measures for the monsoon season.
In the alert dated May 26, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the KPT listed the steps which would be taken as safety measures for heavy rains, wind and flooding.
The measures included close monitoring and assessments of the safety of ships, ensuring mooring lines were set optically, and all pilots were to be on standby.
The alert also said, “Small boats are to be parked at locations less prone to wind and water pressures and to be properly secured.”
“Perform periodic maintenance for electrical items and standby generator should be readily available on short notice,” it added.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606517-at-least-six-killed-as-heavy-rains-dust-storms-hit-parts-of-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>At least six killed as heavy rains, dust storms hit parts of Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

For over a week, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected strike that took place in Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told Dawn.com that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.
The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.
Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by Dawn.com. Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.
When approached by Dawn.com, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.
Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told Dawn.com that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.
However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.
Last week, the local elders had threatened to march to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27182314aa0dc58.jpg?r=201429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913674/three-dead-multiple-injured-as-rains-batter-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Three dead, multiple injured as rains batter KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>At least three people lost their lives and multiple others were injured as strong winds and thunderstorms lashed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab on Tuesday.

Nabeel told Dawn.com that the incident occurred due to strong winds and storms, adding that the toddler’s mother and another child were injured and taken to a hospital.
In another incident, he said the roof of a shed collapsed in Ziarat Cham Baba, trapping a mother and her son under the debris, who were pulled out of the rubble by locals and taken to a hospital.
In Shangla District’s Bisham tehsil, lightning struck a house, killing one person and leaving six others unconscious, Rescue 1122 official Rasool Khan Sharif said.

A roof and wall collapse in Mattani village injured three people, while another person was injured in the collapse of a wall in the city’s Garhi Qamardin area. A solar panel fell on Phandu Road and injured a person.
Earlier today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that the district administrations to take precautionary measures as more rain and gusty winds were expected in the upper and central parts of the country.
At least 19 people were killed over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Many of the casualties were caused by the walls and roofs of the houses collapsing and trees falling on them, according to the PDMA.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) had forecasted most of South Asia to experience above-normal rainfall and above-average temperatures during this year’s southwest monsoon season from June to September.
One killed, 8 injured across Punjab
Meanwhile, at least one person was killed and eight others were injured in the rains across Punjab, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmed.
One person died due to lightening in Mianwali’s Kala Bagh Bazaar. Another person was injured in Mianwali the wall of the Makarwal police station collapsed due to strong winds.
In Rawalpindi, two children were injured by a falling object from the roof and one person was injured by falling from ladder.
A 22-year-old woman was injured after a mud house collapsed in Attock. In Gujranwala, a girl fell from the roof into the courtyard due to strong winds. A solar panel fell from the roof due to strong winds in Miaoli, injuring one person.
In Islamabad, strong winds persisted for an extended period, toppling trees and billboards, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The intense weather conditions prompted motorists to take shelter under bridges to protect their vehicles from a possible hailstorm, the report said, adding that motorcyclists sought refuge under flyovers to shield themselves from the strong gusts.
The Punjab PDMA urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across the province to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of Punjab, a statement by the PDMA said.
“Relevant departments to be on alert to deal with emergency situations,” the statement read, adding that the provincial control room and all district emergency operation centres have also been alerted.
The situation was being monitored 24/7 in the PDMA control room, DG Kathia said.
He added, “Citizens should be careful and stay away from electric poles and hanging wires.
“Stay in safe places to avoid lightning. Never stay in open places during bad weather and lightning. Avoid unnecessary travel and drive slowly.”</p><small>2025-05-27 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271913311b9374e.png?r=003041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913684/pakistan-to-celebrate-eidul-azha-on-june-7-as-zilhaj-moon-not-sighted' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to celebrate Eidul Azha on June 7 as Zilhaj moon not sighted</strong></a><br><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.
Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.
Earlier this week, Suparco predicted that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
 
 

According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.
Cloudy weather reported in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-27 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2717442548e6498.jpg?r=175256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654/nab-to-auction-six-bahria-town-properties-in-rawalpindi-islamabad-on-june-12' target='_blank'><strong>NAB to auction six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi, Islamabad on June 12</strong></a><br><p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday announced a public auction of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on June 12.
The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against property tycoon Malik Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an absconder in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust Case.
In a notification today, NAB listed six properties of the project owned by tycoon Malik Riaz, including five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad.
The properties were being auctioned to recover the defaulted amount of a plea bargain under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance 1999, it added.
NAB media director Birj Lal Dosani confirmed the details to Dawn.com, stating that the amount was being recovered in connection with corruption charges under a plea bargain.
 
 

Earlier this year, the watchdog warned the public against investing in Bahria Town’s Dubai project and began extradition efforts for Riaz and his son.
In February, NAB [filed] a reference against Riaz, ex-Sindh chief minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Minister Sharjeel Memon, and others for land transfer to Bahria Town. The watchdog also filed two corruption references for unlawf­u­lly acquiring 4,500 kanals of state land in Rawalpindi’s New Murree for Bahria Golf City and Takht Pari forest area.
In March, NAB said it had sealed “numerous” commercial and residential properties of Bahria Town in Karachi, Lahore, Takht Pari, New Murree/Golf City, and Islamabad over corruption cases filed against Riaz. It had also frozen hundreds of bank accounts and vehicles of Bahria Town.
Separately, a Rawalpindi Accountability court had issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Riaz and his son, Ali Ahmed Malik, in the Takht Pari reference.
NAB has multiple times warned the public to “avoid any attractive inducements from Bahria Town and to protect their hard-earned savings”.
 
 

According to senior counsel Khawaja Haris, a plea bargain agreement was considered successful if an accused confesses to a crime and then agrees to return the money in return for “a lighter punishment”.
From 2000 to 2022, the accountability watchdog recovered Rs65 billion through plea bargain out of a total of Rs91.55bn, a NAB official told the Supreme Court in 2022.</p><small>2025-05-27 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606460-ruet-e-hilal-committee-meeting-underway-for-zil-hajj-moon-sighting' target='_blank'><strong>Zil Hajj moon not sighted, Eid ul Adha to be celebrated on June 7</strong></a><br><p>

• Claims ex-PM has cautioned PTI leaders against ‘playing from both sides’
• FIA court holds hearing in Bvlgari jewellery set case
ISLAMABAD: While PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Monday expressed the hope that Imran Khan will be released before Eidul Azha, the ex-PM’s sister said such rumours were being spread to cool down the nation aimed at keeping them from holding protests.
Aleema Khan, while quoting her brother, said that soon a countrywide movement will be launched and asked the party leaders to stop playing from both sides.
Barrister Gohar said the legal team was hopeful that cases against the incarcerated leader will be fixed soon and he will be released before Eid.
He urged the party workers to remain calm and assured them that all possible efforts were being made to get Imran Khan freed.
Aleema Khan while speaking to media outside Adiala Jail disagreed with Barrister Gohar’s optimism saying such rumours were being spread to calm down the PTI supporters.
She complained that ex-PM’s children were allowed to speak to him only once during the past eight months and his medical check-up directives were also not being implemented.
“Even books are not allowed into the cell. Imran Khan has said that he will not kneel down even if he would be kept in the jail for the rest of his life. Tens of Vloggers are claiming on a daily basis that some important personality has met Imran Khan. Others said some American had called on him. However, the fact is that all such claims are rumours and they are being spread to cool down the supporters,” she asserted.
Aleema Khan said that in a message to party leaders her brother had stated that even his family members had been kept in jail. “Hassan Niazi has been imprisoned for 10 years,” she said.
She quoted Imran Khan as saying that PTI has an ideology and he has been watching everyone. Those who have been playing a double game should decide about their future. She also quoted him as saying that even judges were not able to decide the cases. She said the former premier had directed the party workers to start preparations for the countrywide mass movement.
According to her, he said that PTI would stand by the judges. “I will not call anyone to Islamabad as there will be snipers but party should start preparations for the countrywide mass movement,” she said while sharing Imran Khan’s message.
Aleema Khan voiced concerns about the conditions of her brother’s imprisonment, claiming that even basic facilities meant for general prisoners were being denied to him.
She claimed that Bushra Bibi, who is accused of aiding and abetting in a corruption case, is being held in isolation to exert pressure on him. She expressed concerns that appeals were not being heard and alleged that judges had gone back on their word to take up the cases.
FIA court hears case
Meanwhile, the Special Court of Federal Investigation Agency completed the cross-examination of sixth prosecution witness in a case related to Toshakhana’s Bvlgari Jewellery set.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand presided over the hearing held inside the Adiala Jail.
Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were presented before the court where PTI lawyer Qusain Faisal Mufti completed the cross-examination of NAB Additional Director Qaiser Mahmood.
A total of six witnesses have been cross-examined so far. The court announced that the statements of other witnesses will be recorded in the next hearing scheduled for May 31.

The SAFE borrowing scheme, backed by the EU’s central budget, was proposed by Brussels in March as the bloc rushes to boost its defences.
Finalised by member states earlier this month, the text received final approval at a meeting of European ministers in Brussels, with 26 countries voting for and one abstention, the presidency said.
EU countries had haggled at length over what the money could be spent on and how countries outside the bloc could access the funds.
In the end, the agreement stuck to the original proposal, allowing 35 per cent of the value of the weapons to come from manufacturers beyond the bloc and Ukraine.
France’s Europe minister Benjamin Haddad called SAFE “a major step forward” that asserts “a very clear principle of European preference to support our industries, reduce our dependencies, including from the US, and invest in Europe’s strategic autonomy.”
“But it is just one step — and we will need to go further,” Haddad told reporters in Brussels.
The borrowing programme is part of a package of measures, including loosening budget rules that Brussels says could potentially unlock 800bn euros of defence spending.
The approval of SAFE came after the EU and the UK agreed a new defence partnership as part of a post-Brexit “reset”.
London would still need to strike a separate deal with the EU if it wants to fully open the new scheme to the British defence industry.</p><small>2025-05-27 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606462-sindh-govt-bans-gifting-ajrak-traditional-cap-in-school-ceremonies' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt bans gifting ajrak, traditional cap in school ceremonies</strong></a><br><p>

Youm-i-Takbeer is observed on May 28, marking the historic day when Pakistan became an atomic power.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last year declared a public holiday throughout the country on account of Youm-i-Takbeer, the day when Pakistan’s defence became impregnable after conducting nuclear tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan in 1998.
The School Education Department has sent a letter to all district education authorities.
It stated that educational institutions will remain open and hold special programmes to celebrate the day with a “positive social message for peace and courage”.
The letter added that May 28 is a “significant day that marks a milestone in our nation’s history, symbolising strength, resilience, and technological advancement”.
It said all schools will conduct activities including morning assembly special programmes, national anthem and prayers, and pay tribute to the Pakistan Army.
All schools will hold speech competitions on the topic of “Significance of Youm-i-Takbeer”, “Pakistan’s Journey to Becoming a Nuclear Power”, and “National Security and Patriotism”. They will also organise arts and posters as well as national songs competitions.
The competitions will be held at the district level in all public schools across Punjab. The top winner of each category at the district level will be awarded a prize of Rs50,000.
The department has urged all schools to participate in these activities and competitions to celebrate the day.
“Students and staff will make a pledge to work for the betterment, peace, and scientific progress of Pakistan,” it added.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, summer vacations shall be declared.</p><small>2025-05-27 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606444-no-holiday-for-punjab-schools-on-may-28' target='_blank'><strong>No holiday for Punjab schools on May 28</strong></a><br><p>

Sadia was also pivotal to Pakistan’s win in the recently concluded ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers in Lahore and was named in the team of the tournament for her nine scalps for an average of 16.
Her economy, like her spin twin Nashra Sandhu, was under four, and this meant that the duo provided the hosts the stranglehold during the middle overs and helped them maintain an unbeaten run throughout the tournament.
“[Sadia] was one of the leading performers at last year’s ICC Women’s T20 World Cup and rises one spot on the rankings for T20I bowlers to claim top billing”, the ICC statement said.
She replaces England spinner Sophie Ecclestone at the top spot who sat out her side’s recent T20I series at home against the West Indies. Her team-mate Lauren Bell however, rose 13 places to jump to sixth overall on the back of her seven wickets for the series against the West Indies.
For the batters, “the big winner on the rankings for T20I batters is Hayley Matthews, with the West Indies captain making some inroads on Australia’s dominance at the top of the rankings following her Player of the Series efforts against England,” the ICC added.
 
 

Last year in the T20 World Cup, Sadia Iqbal claimed three wickets for Pakistan as the Green Team beat Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka in their opening encounter of that tournament.
On the back of that match-winning performance, she subsequently became the first Pakistani woman bowler to top the ICC rankings.</p><small>2025-05-27 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271313216ac18b7.jpg?r=131816' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913620/india-approves-stealth-fighter-programme-amid-tensions-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India approves stealth fighter programme amid tensions with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s defence minister has approved a framework for building the country’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, amid a new arms race with Pakistan weeks after a military conflict between the neighbours.
Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.
The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.
Pakistan has one of China’s advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it claims to have used to shoot down India’s latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.
 






Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.
 
 

It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to Reuters’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.
India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.
In March, an Indian defence committee had recommended including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India’s military aircraft.
 
 

Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh has previously criticised Hindustan Aeronautics for slow delivery of light combat Tejas aircraft, a 4.5 generation fighter, which the firm blamed on slow delivery of engines from General Electric due to supply chain issues faced by the US firm.</p><small>2025-05-27 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27141811b7e0e8d.jpg?r=141822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913643/policeman-on-polio-duty-gunned-down-in-balochistans-noshki' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman on polio duty gunned down in Balochistan’s Noshki</strong></a><br><p>A policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was gunned down on Tuesday by unknown attackers in Balochistan’s Noshki district, according to an official.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic, and vaccination teams are frequently targeted by militants waging a campaign against security forces.
Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Hussain Soomro confirmed the “unfortunate incident” to Dawn.com, in which Waheed Ahmed was gunned down in Noshki’s Killi Muhammad Hassni district.
He said that police have set up checkpoints at various places to search for the attackers, who will be arrested soon.
DC Soomro noted that security of the health department staff working on the anti-polio campaign has been further beefed up.
He added that the anti-polio campaign is continuing even after the terrorist incident and the targets given to the anti-polio teams in Noshki district for this national cause will be completed soon.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the martyred was a resident of Jalalabad, Noshki.
“The polio campaign is a national duty, and any attack on it is intolerable,” Rind said in a statement, paying tribute to the slain officer who “sacrificed himself while on duty”.
“This attack is a conspiracy to sabotage the national campaign and spread fear and panic,” Rind added.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in Noshki and offered heartfelt condolences to the family of the bereaved.
He noted that the courage and sacrifice of polio officials “[inspires] us all to save our children from this crippling disease.”
The president reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fully eradicating polio.
“We have the tools, the will, and the support of our global partners to make this vision a reality,” he said in a statement issued today. “I call on parents to open their doors to vaccinators, ensuring every child receives the life-saving polio drops.
“I urge teachers, religious leaders, and community elders to champion this noble cause, dispelling myths and building trust. I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.”
He reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “whose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio”.
“Today, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.
“We also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.
Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a “cowardly and inhumane act.”
He emphasised that targeting the polio campaign is equivalent to attacking the future of innocent children. While paying tribute to the martyred official, the minister hailed him as a “hero of the nation.”
Kakar warned that any effort to derail the polio campaign would be seen as a direct challenge to the writ of the state, and affirmed that the government will deal with terrorists with an iron fist.
Yesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the ongoing vaccination drive which kicked off on Sunday.
 
 

The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.

The incident occurred in the Phulra area of Mansehra district where the woman and her minor daughter were killed inside their home. The woman had reportedly tied the knot against her family’s will through court marriage in 2021.
Mansehra District Police Officer (DPO) Shafiullah Gandapur confirmed the incident to Dawn.com and said efforts were underway to apprehend the suspects.
He said their bodies had been shifted to a nearby hospital where an autopsy was being conducted, while police teams have been dispatched to the area where the incident occurred to track down the suspects.
The DPO said that according to initial reports, the victim tied the knot with Roshan of Bagal tribe, which triggered a clash between the two families.
Police have lodged an FIR on the complaint of the victim’s mother.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Nasir Mahmood Sati said a “heartbreaking incident took place today in the backdrop of long-standing enmity in village Nallah under Phulra police station limits, in which a woman and her young daughter were brutally murdered,” according to a statement from the office of the Regional Police Officer (RPO).
Taking immediate notice of the incident, DIG Sati issued orders to DPO Gandapur for the immediate arrest of the suspects.
Special teams consisting of heavy police personnel have been formed which are conducting extensive search operations in the entire area, under the direct supervision of DPO Gandapur, along with Senior Superintendent of Police Oghi Nazir Khan, DSPs, SHOs and other officers.
Police officials said intelligence-based operations are underway to ensure the early arrest of the suspects.
“Honour” killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab.
From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country. The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that up to 5,000 women are killed each year in the name of ‘honour’. Experts believe that many ‘honour’ killings are not reported at all or are classified as suicides or accidents.</p><small>2025-05-27 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606427-polio-campaign-suspended-after-cop-martyred-in-attack-on-team-in-nushki' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman protecting polio workers martyred in Nushki, drive suspended</strong></a><br><p>

The government’s failed first attempt to privatise PIA cost the national exchequer $4.3 million, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed on February 26.
In March, Privatisation and Investment Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said that the government would complete all the steps to privatise PIA by May, while the pri­vatisation commission approved a transaction structure for the second attempt to privatise the national carrier based on a divestment of 51 to 100 per cent of its shares of capital.
 
 

The earlier deadline was June 3, with the bidding process expected to take place between October and December.
According to a statement from the ministry, the deadline for submission on expressions of interest till 4pm on June 19.
Last month, a PIA spokesperson said that the carrier’s bo­­ard of directors approved its fin­ancial results for 2024, which showed the airline achieving a net profit after around 21 years.
According to the results for FY2024, PIA earned an operational profit of Rs3.9 billion and a net profit of Rs2.26bn. The airline’s operating margin was more than 12pc, which is on a par with the performance of any of the best airlines in the world, the spokesperson said.
PIA began to be unprofitable in 2011, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the national flag carrier was saddled with $3bn in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3bn in debt, up from $2.97bn the year before. Government bailouts were required for the carrier’s continued operation.
Last year in June, the then-government had agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises, including PIA, under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3bn bailout. But in February 2024 — right before the general elections — the election commission had asked the then-caretaker administration to “refrain” from finalising the deal.</p><small>2025-05-27 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606412-memoir-reveals-gen-kayanis-role-in-facilitating-musharrafs-removal' target='_blank'><strong>Memoir reveals Gen Kayani's role in facilitating Musharraf's removal</strong></a><br><p>

The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
In a video shared by Indian news outlet ANI, Modi says: “The people of Pakistan must come forward to rid their country of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.”
He went on to say: “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or [choose my] bullet,” to applause from the crowd, with many adorned in orange and white outfits.
 






A statement by the FO early on Tuesday said Pakistan has taken note of Modi’s remarks “delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.
“The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in region already burdened by volatility,” the FO said.
“We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.”
 






The FO noted that such statement “blatantly violate” the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.
“Pakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir.
“Pakistan’s record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite.
“If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward-toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology,” the FO said.
It added that Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.
“However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.
“The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.”</p><small>2025-05-27 06:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606398-mobile-phones-cash-looted-in-armed-robbery-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Robbers loot phones from Defence mobile shop in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The 55-year-old reached the 8,849-metre (29,032 foot) peak — the highest in the world — by the traditional southeast ridge route while guiding a 22-member Indian army team, officials said, adding that 27 other Sherpas also accompanied the group.
“He is a very passionate climber,” said Pasang Phurba, director of the Seven Summit Treks company for which Kami Rita works, adding that Kami Rita was currently descending to lower camps.
Kami Rita, who uses only his first name, first climbed Everest in 1994 and has done so every year except for three years when authorities closed the mountain to climbers for various reasons.
More than 8,000 people have climbed Mount Everest since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.
After Kami Rita, another Sherpa, Pasang Dawa, has ascended Everest the most with 29 climbs. Among non-Sherpa climbers, the record is held by British guide Kenton Cool who has accomplished the feat 19 times, followed by American climbers Dave Hahn and Garrett Madison with 15 times each.
One of the poorest countries in the world, Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks and is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking, and tourism for foreign exchange. Guiding foreign climbers to Everest and other peaks provides crucial family income to many Sherpas.
Authorities have issued 468 permits to climbers for Everest this March-May climbing season, and more than 300 climbers and Sherpas have already scaled the peak, officials said.
Two climbers are known to have died on the mountain this month and there have also been unconfirmed reports of other deaths.</p><small>2025-05-27 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606389-brawl-erupts-at-wedding-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Brawl erupts at wedding in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>
