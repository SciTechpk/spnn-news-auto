The case was filed on the complaint of a local on July 17, 2024, and was registered at Kameer Police Station under FIR No. 710/24 in Sahiwal district.
The FIR stated that the “alleged incident of blasphemy occurred on July 17, 2024, but was registered four months later, supported by testimonies from two local witnesses“.
The court found the two individuals guilty of violating Sections 295-A and 295-C, Sections 7/9 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, and Section 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In his detailed verdict, the judge ruled that the convicts were separately sentenced to death and fined Rs500,000 under Section 295-C, 10 years imprisonment under Section 295-A, seven years under PECA 2016, and five years along with a fine of Rs50,000 under ATA 1997.
A senior police official of Sahiwal district told Dawn that “a total of 22 blasphemy-related cases were registered in Sahiwal district in 2025”.
This verdict marks one of the most severe punishments handed down by the court under blasphemy-related provisions during the current year.
Earlier in March, a Rawalpindi court had sentenced five men accused of blasphemy to death, life imprisonment and a total of 100 years in prison.
The same court had also sentenced four men to death for posting blasphemous content online in February.</p><small>2025-12-22 20:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/222332579286bbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962641/meetings-with-imran-khan-will-remain-suspended-till-february-8-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Meetings with Imran Khan will remain suspended till February 8: minister</strong></a><br><p>Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Monday that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8.
“Meetings with Khan will remain suspended till Feb 8,” the minister said while speaking on Geo News’ show Capital Talk, in reply to a question by the show’s host about whether meetings with Imran would remain suspended.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
Chaudhry maintained that the prison is “not the headquarters of a political party”, and criticised the PTI for “spreading venom against institutions and leaders of the institutions“.
The PML-N leader said that regular meetings were held between PTI leaders and its founder in Adiala jail in the past, and the government had no issues. However, he stated that the meetings then turned into political press conferences outside the prison, and the opposition party started to create narratives, which were then “run by Indian media”.
Responding to the minister, PTI‘s Barrister Ali Zafar said the the Constitution of the country considers solitary confinement akin to torture, adding the Chaudhry’s statement is against human rights, international and local laws.
“PTI asks party leaders and parliamentarians to gather outside Adiala prison to express solidarity with Khan, but the government uses water canons and violence against peaceful protesters.”
Last week, water cannons were used to disperse Imran‘s sisters, party leaders and PTI workers after they staged sit-ins outside the Adiala prison against the officials’ refusal to let them meet with the ex-premiere.
Zafar maintained that the PTI “will not back down till we meet with Khan”.
He elaborated that if the government considered the possibility of dialogue to break the current political impasse and was sincere about moving forward, then meetings with Imran would be part of the process.
Prison meetings with Imran used to plan PTI protests: Sanaullah
Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said prison meetings with Imran had been suspended because they were being used to plan and coordinate a large protest in Islamabad to mark the anniversary of the PTI’s November 26, 2024, march to the capital.
On November 26, 2024, Islamabad witnessed pitched battles between security forces and PTI supporters as the latter inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk for the party’s ‘final call’ powershow, with intense teargas shelling used to disperse the protesters.
A late-night crackdown by the government ended in a hasty retreat of the PTI’s top leadership and supporters, following which the party abruptly suspended its protest movement.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Sanaullah said that the party founder and his sister were discussing preparations for a large protest on November 26 this year before the meetings were suspended.
“Before the meetings were stopped four or five weeks ago, they discussed that on November 26, 2025, they would arrange a programme of this sort to mark what happened on that day in 2024,” he stated.
“The preparations, messaging and strategic planning were discussed in these meetings, which is why we stopped them,”
The PM’s aide added that stopping the meetings had led to rumours about Imran’s condition while incarcerated, including reports of poor health, and clarified that the PTI founder had “every facility available to him.”
Sanaullah said that statements by Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were “not her own words” and claimed that the party founder had outlined what she should say during a meeting with another sister, Uzma Khan, several weeks earlier.
Responding to a question about the TTAP’s nationwide strike call on February 8 next year, the PM’s aide said there would be no wheel-jam strike in “any street or neighbourhood” anywhere in Pakistan.
“The PM has tried negotiations four times. I do not know whether he has presented the option again,” he added. “From the other side, based on the response we are getting, do you think they want to resolve this through talks?”
Referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s call for a march to Islamabad, Sanaullah asked, “Why would they be permitted to protest in Islamabad? Does he have a legal basis? He says he is coming to Islamabad armed and that he will either conquer the city or return in a coffin. Is this in the national interest?”
“We’ll see what kind of protests they stage and how different they are,” he added. “Sohail Afridi cannot come down from Peshawar and take over the country.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-22 18:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640953-no-meetings-with-jailed-pti-founder-till-feb-8-says-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No meetings with jailed PTI founder till Feb 8, says minister</strong></a><br><p>

A special court sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case on Saturday. In protest, the PTI announced it would observe a black day on Sunday against the conviction, as per an announcement posted on Imran’s social media account.
Following the protest call, extensive security arrangements had been put in place in Rawalpindi, with over 1,300 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order. Though the day passed peacefully, as not a single activist of PTI appeared on the roads.
Police said that a group of political workers. led by PTI leader Seemabia Tahir and nine others. gathered on Adiala Road on Sunday night at about 9:15pm.
The protesters, nine of whom were identified in the first information report, gathered on Adiala Road near Nasir Bakery and blocked the road, causing traffic congestion and public disorder, despite the enforcement of Section 144, a legal provision prohibiting public gatherings of more than five people.
Constable Rizwan Nazir lodged an FIR with Morgah Police Station, claiming that he was on security duty when some political activists, led by Tahir and carrying PTI flags while riding on motorcycles and in cars, gathered on the road. The protesters, who were chanting slogans, blocked the road and caused traffic congestion.
The FIR stated that the protesters were carrying batons, despite the constable informing them that they were violating Section 144. Instead of responding, they began shouting slogans against the government, incited by the former PTI MPA.
The police registered the FIR on the charges of blocking the road, violating Section 144 and under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO. Those booked were also charged under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, prompting his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex. These have sometimes been dispersed by police using water cannons and baton charges.</p><small>2025-12-22 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221917456f89f13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962637/air-india-aircraft-turns-back-after-drop-in-engine-oil-pressure-regulator-says' target='_blank'><strong>Air India aircraft turns back after drop in engine oil pressure, regulator says</strong></a><br><p>An Air India Boeing 777 aircraft had to turn back after a drop in oil pressure forced the pilots to turn off one of the jet’s engines, India’s aviation regulator said on Monday.
The aircraft, which was headed to India’s financial capital of Mumbai, landed safely back in Delhi and the incident will be investigated, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement. Modern aircraft are designed to safely fly and land on a single engine, if required.
Air India has been under intense scrutiny this year after the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. The DGCA has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government till 2022.
An Air India investigation into why one of its planes conducted commercial flights without an airworthiness permit found “systemic failures”, with the airline admitting it needed to do better on compliance, Reuters reported earlier this month.
On Monday, pilots observed a low engine oil pressure on the B777-300ER aircraft’s right-hand engine during flaps retraction after take-off. The pressure dropped to zero shortly thereafter, and the crew shut down the engine and turned back as per procedure, the DGCA said.
“Air India sincerely regrets [the] inconvenience caused due to this unforeseen situation. The aircraft is undergoing the necessary checks,” an Air India spokesperson said in a statement.
The aircraft is 15 years old and has flown to locations such as Vienna, Vancouver and Chicago, according to Flightradar24. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incident.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22190815459ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962635/islamabad-court-awards-rs54bn-compensation-to-families-of-airblue-crash-victims' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court awards Rs5.4bn compensation to families of AirBlue crash victims</strong></a><br><p>An additional district court in Islamabad awarded compensation amounting to Rs5.4 billion to the families of eight victims of the 2010 Airblue plane crash, which killed all 152 people aboard in the Margalla Hills.
The court, headed by Rasool Bashir Mirjat, dismissed an appeal filed by Airblue, upheld the airline’s liability in the case, and imposed a penalty of Rs1 million on the airline for delaying the proceedings.
Airblue Flight 202, which had taken off from Karachi in the morning, crashed into Islamabad’s Margalla Hills, killing all 152 people on board on July 28, 2010.
According to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) investigation report, the crash was classified as a “Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT), in which the aircrew failed to display superior judgment and professional skills in a self-created unsafe environment. In their pursuit to land in inclement weather, they committed serious violations of procedures and breaches of flying discipline, which put the aircraft in an unsafe condition over dangerous terrain at low altitude.”
The inquiry cited pilot error, including descent below the prescribed safe altitude and deviation from standard operating procedures during a circling approach in poor visibility. Investigators also highlighted poor cockpit resource management and challenging weather conditions, including rain and low clouds.
Subsequent court observations and reports also noted that errors by air traffic control contributed to the unsafe conditions leading up to the crash.
The court ruling marked a significant development in the long-running legal battle for compensation, which has spanned over 15 years. Families of the victims were repeatedly called for accountability and timely relief, saying prolonged litigation compounded their suffering.
Legal experts said the judgment could set an important precedent for aviation liability and compensation cases in Pakistan.
Most of the families were forced by Airblue to sign the release document and accept the First Tier Liability as their final compensation.
However, a few families adhered to the principle of fair compensation and led the court fight against Airblue, which ultimately resulted in them receiving fair compensation.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22170045b8982b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962630/local-bodies-polls-to-be-held-on-party-basis-punjab-govt-informs-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Local bodies polls to be held on ‘party basis’, Punjab govt informs LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the local government (LG) elections in the province would be held on a “party basis”.
An assistant advocate general (AAG) shared this information about LG elections — which have been delayed for long and are not expected to be held before the second quarter of next year — during a hearing of petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)-backed lawmaker Sheikh Imtiaz and others, who have challenged the Punjab Local Government Act 2025 (PLGA).
Contrary to the AAG’s claim, the local government law enacted in October states that the elections are to be held on a non-party basis.
But, the AAG submitted a report on behalf of the local government secretary today, which said that any political party wishing to contest the LG polls “may allow its candidates to contest elections for any political office on its ticket”.
“Section 55 of the PLGA does not, in any manner, put any party at a disadvantage compared to others,” he said.
At that, LHC Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad asked whether the petitioners’ grievances had been addressed as the government itself was saying that the LG elections would be party-based.
In this regard, the petitioner’s lawyer said that if that was the case, “then our concern to the extent of one point stands resolved”.
He requested that the government’s reply be made part of the record.
Justice Ahmad also heard Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Director General (Law) Khurram Shahzad, who said the ECP was a constitutional body “ready to fulfil its duties”.
“The commission had written nearly 80 letters to the government over the past four years regarding holding local government elections and will conduct polls under whatever law the government enacted,” he maintained.
“The Punjab government had given a January 10 deadline for election preparations,” the ECP official added.
At one point, Justice Ahmad questioned why the Punjab advocate general’s office had not submitted a formal reply to the petitions challenging the local government law. He directed the advocate general to submit a reply by Tuesday.
“Certain provisions of the impugned act appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution,” the judge further observed.
He also commented that the matter needed to be decided “promptly”.
The PLGA 2025 was steamrolled from the Punjab Assembly in a matter of just five days, only after the ECP’s strong intervention and announcement to hold local government elections under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December.
LG elections in Punjab have been delayed for long and the matter goes back to 2019. In April that year, the then PTI-led Punjab government had dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
This meant that LG elections in Punjab were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
This year, on Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Oct 21, in light of the new law, after a request by the Punjab government.
The ECP withdrew its original delimitation schedule for the elections issued under the 2022 local government law, giving the provincial government four weeks to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules.
On October 31, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year as the commission would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
The prerequisites are scheduled to be in place by January 10, 2026, following which the ECP would begin the delimitation process.
For its part, the opposition PTI said the new LG law was a sheer violation of Article 140 of the Constitution and decided to challenge the law in the court.
Article 140 says, “Each province shall, by law, establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments”.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2218055829658d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962634/winter-vacations-to-begin-from-dec-23-in-colleges-across-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Winter vacations to begin from Dec 23 in colleges across Punjab: minister</strong></a><br><p>Winter vacations in colleges across Punjab will begin from December 23 and run till January 10, according to a revised schedule issued on Monday.
The Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat made the announcement in a post on the social media platform X.







Earlier this month, the Punjab government announced the winter vacation schedule for public and private schools in the province.
According to a notification by the School Education Department, the break will be from Dec 22 to Jan 10.
In Sindh, all schools and colleges will remain closed for winter vacations during the last week of the month, starting from Dec 22 till Dec 31.
Meanwhile, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial government last week announced that winter vacation for the educational institutions will start from Jan 1 in the summer zone and run till Jan 15. In the winter zone, educational institutions will remain closed from Dec 23 till February 28.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2217242107fc4d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962632/bangladeshi-student-leader-shot-in-khulna-report' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladeshi student leader shot in Khulna: report</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladeshi student political leader from the National Citizen Party (NCP) was shot and injured in Khulna on Monday, according to The Daily Star.
The development comes after Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died last Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
According to The Daily Star, the injured 42-year-old Mohammad Motaleb Sikder is the NCP’s divisional chief in Khulna.
“Miscreants opened fire targeting his head around 11:45am (10:45am PKT) near Gazi Medical College Hospital in the city,” the paper reported, quoting Rafikul Islam, the officer-in-charge of Sonadanga Model Police Station. “He was rushed to Khulna Medical College Hospital in critical condition.”
Quoting the officer, the publication reported that Sidker was “out of danger”, as the bullet entered through one side of his ear, pierced the skin, and exited through the other side.
Following the attack on Hadi, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, were set on fire and vandalised, according to authorities.
In November, gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, as campaigning for February’s landmark elections was underway.
The shooting took place at a rally of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22164901634848b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962629/fencing-champion-banin-nasry-sets-sights-on-olympics-after-gold-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Fencing champion Banin Nasry sets sights on Olympics after gold at national games</strong></a><br><p>National champions are typically forged from years of rigorous training, determination and a foray into the sport in childhood. But Umul Banin Nasry is anything but typical.
Her journey to fencing stardom began with one element; curiosity. Barely one month after taking up the sport, she won gold at the national fencing championships, although her gold medal at last month’s 35th National Games holds a sense of greater grandeur for her.
Now, as the 21-year-old awaits her international debut and a chance to become Pakistan’s first fencer at the Olympics, her journey is intentional, fuelled by an unwavering commitment to training and family support in defiance of societal disapproval.
It all began five years ago. Banin was intrigued by some women at her college in Quetta practicing “weird stepping movements”, only to find out it was for a sport called fencing. She tried her hand at it — quite literally — and immediately fell in love with a sport she had only seen online. Her coach signed her up for the 4th National Fencing Championships, where her unexpected gold medal solidified her commitment to the sport and a departure from flag football that she had also played at a national level.
She entered the mindset of a champion right after becoming one; five hours of training every day — “there’s no days off, no excuses” — and a daily schedule that revolved around her desire for excellence in the sport.
In the lead up to the national games, Banin spent all day training at Ayub National Stadium. Even when the Covid-19 pandemic brought the world to a halt, Banin would show up to an empty stadium to train.
“The first time I competed, I was up against athletes who trained abroad and had experience I was nowhere close to,” she told Dawn over the phone from Quetta, where she had promptly resumed training after claiming four medals at the national games in Karachi, including two golds. It was the final jewel in her national crown after she won silver at the National Games in her hometown in 2023.
“I trained till I became mentally invincible, telling myself that my opponents are just athletes like myself, nothing else.”
Her literal journey in the sport was costly. Roundtrip transportation from her house till Ayub National Stadium where she trained cost one thousand rupees per day, which was unaffordable. The only solution was to walk for nearly 30 minutes from her house till a checkpost and then taking a rickshaw to the stadium from there. Men stared at her as she walked alone. Society whispered about how and why her family had allowed her to take up a sport like this, oblivious to her national accolades.
But her family was unwavering in their support from the start. After all, she belongs to Pakistan’s Hazara community that boasts exceptional talent in football and martial arts, where Banin’s younger brother is provincial Taekwondo champion. Younger sister Maheen followed in her footsteps and took up fencing, winning a bronze for team Navy at the National Games.

Banin credits her eldest brother with her sporting success. The only non-athlete sibling in the family, Arif Nasry filled the financial gaps for Banin by scouting for sponsors and getting two ahead of the National Games. He meticulously manages her social media accounts to promote her through a digital platform. Government recognition has been sparse, and appreciation for her provincial and national triumphs has been empty promises of cash prizes that have never materialised.
But Banin’s biggest cheerleader has been Haji Muhammad Qasim, secretary of the Balochistan Fencing Association. He arranges for the athletes’ equipment which only comes from abroad and is not locally manufactured. He staunchly defends his athletes when their families complain that medals are meaningless and sports have no value.
“Without him, I don’t think I would have gotten as far as I have,” Banin said, her voice heavy with genuine admiration for her guru.
Of course, her coach Mehmood Sharif is the main driving force. Just a couple years older than Banin, 23-year-old Mehmood himself is a two-time national champion and recently represented Pakistan at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh.
The competition would have been Banin’s international debut, but a lack of funds delayed her dreams till 2026. She’s hoping to travel to Iran at the start of next year for intense training for a couple months before making the national team for the Commonwealth Games in July and Asian Games in September.
“My journey has just begun,” Banin said less than a week after her national triumphs.
She admitted that having access to electrical fencing equipment — the kind used in competitions for scoring and precision — gave her an edge in the sport compared to manual equipment typically used in training. It’s almost as if everything has aligned for her to reach greater heights in the sport, despite the socioeconomic hurdles in her way.

She already knows her Olympic debut will be a tribute — and beacon of hope — to the women who weren’t allowed to fulfill their passions like she was.
“When I make it big on the international stage, I want to silence all those who say that women don’t belong in sports and are immoral if they do.

Jahangiri has found himself mired in a fake degree controversy since last year and has been facing legal proceedings in the SHC and IHC over the matter. While an IHC division bench, led by Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, ruled on December 18 that his degree was “invalid” and his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority”, the SHC extended today its order under which KU’s August 2024 decision to cancel his degree remains suspended.
The order has been suspended until the next hearing, the date for which will be decided later.
The decision was taken by a two-judge bench, comprising Justices Yousuf Ali Saeed and Abdul Mobeen Lakho, as it heard a contempt plea filed against the KU Vice Chancellor (VC) Professor Khalid Mehmood Iraqi and Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
Separately, Jahangiri‘s lawyer Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed said while speaking to the media at the court that “we filed a contempt application against KU as it concealed from the IHC“ the SHC order that suspended the varsity‘s “proceedings” in the case, as well as its decision to cancel Jahangiri’s law degree
During the hearing, KU VC Iraqi and Registrar Siddiqui appeared before the court and submitted affidavits.
The KU registrar argued that “now that the IHC has issued the final verdict, the contempt of court plea should be dismissed as it has become ineffective”.
He told the court that KU had not taken any action in compliance with SHC‘s October 3 order to suspend the cancellation of Jahangiri’s law degree.
“The IHC sought KU’s records via the Higher Education Commission,” he said.
Vice Chancellor Iraqi told the bench that the degree records were presented in court without any “alteration”.
The court directed Barrister Ahmed to receive replies submitted by the parties.
For his part, Barrister Ahmed argued that the case “should be heard soon”, highlighting the “urgency” of the matter.
Justice Saeed observed: “Today is the last day of this bench; the bench will hear the case as per the roster after the winter vacations.”
Following this observation, the bench extended its interim order till the next hearing.
During his media talk, Barrister Ahmed said the bench had observed that it was their last working day today and suggested that an “urgency application” may be filed later by Jahangiri’s side.
The lawyer also contended that while IHC CJ Dogar observed in his ruling on December 18 that the SHC had barred KU from taking any further action, it was not the case. “KU was not just stopped from further action, but their cancellation order had been suspended”.
He further added that “legally, the order remains suspended to date. IHC has taken a decision based on something which does not exist. A judge has been removed from office on [the basis of] an order that was suspended and remains suspended”.</p><small>2025-12-22 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2216122726a3059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962628/pakistan-played-fearless-not-careless-cricket-to-win-under-19-asia-cup-says-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan played ‘fearless, not careless’ cricket to win Under-19 Asia Cup, says head coach</strong></a><br><p>Head coach Shahid Anwer said that Pakistan had achieved their goal of playing “fearless but not careless cricket” after they won the Under-19 Asia Cup with a crushing victory over India on Sunday.
Opener Sameer Minhas led the way for Pakistan at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai with a breathtaking 172 to set up a massive 191-run victory for his side.
“We began a process on June 17 [this year],” recalled Shahid at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday, following the team’s arrival and a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif where a Rs10million cash award was announced.
“It was an unprecedented step … we called up 70 players, conducted trials and gave each player four matches each and then they participated in a regional One-day tournament,” he added.
“The top performers, 30 of them, then took part in a five-month long camp … that’s how the team was made.
“We wanted to play fearless but not careless cricket. We wanted a united team and the result is in front of us.”
Team mentor and manager Sarfaraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to the Under-19 World Cup crown in 2006, hailed a “team effort”.







“We had players that had the potential to do something big,” said Sarfaraz.
“The coaches did a lot of hard work and the players responded … our job was to give them the confidence to play to their full potential. My message to them was to play their natural game, and in a way that they remember it for the rest of their lives.”
Captain Farhan Yousaf said the players had the full backing of the team management.
“We spoke about playing fearless cricket and the management backed us to play our natural game,” he said.
“We were told us that any loss will be our [management’s] concern, while any victory will be attributed to your efforts. Our morale never went down.”
Shahid pointed to the fact that the coaching staff was lucky to have been blessed with qualified players.
“In age group cricket, most of the work is on basics,” he said. “We were lucky in the sense that these players had two qualities that we only needed to polish: one that they didn’t give up and second that they were adaptable.”
Sameer’s stunning ton was naturally one of the major talking points at the news conference and the batter said that he stuck to his natural game.
“I was focused on doing well and making runs in the final and that helped me,” said Sameer.
The political rivalry between India and Pakistan, more often than not, spills onto the cricket field and Sarfaraz said he made sure his players did not make any vile gestures in response to their counterparts.
India skipped the customary handshakes; a practice they have been carrying on since the men’s Asia Cup T20 earlier this year while one of their batters, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, made a ‘shoe-pointing’ gesture after his dismissal.
“India’s behavior regarding the game was not good, and their players’ conduct was unethical,” he said. “But we celebrated the victory, displaying sportsman’s spirit.”</p><small>2025-12-22 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221231512594073.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623/bangladesh-rejects-indias-dismissal-of-protest-outside-its-high-commission-in-delhi-as-misleading-propaganda' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh rejects India’s dismissal of protest outside its high commission in Delhi as ‘misleading propaganda’</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh has rejected India’s dismissal of a protest outside its high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”, saying the incident was “highly regrettable“.
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.
In response, the Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal issued a statement on Sunday saying India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
“The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on December 20 and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,” he said.
According to Prothom Alo, Das — a garment factory worker — was beaten to death on December 18 in Mymensingh, Bangladesh on allegations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire. It reported that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
“There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes,” the Indian official said.
“Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” he added.
“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,” he said.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.







“The miscreants were allowed to carry out their activities right outside the perimeters of the high commission, creating panic among the personnel inside the complex,” it said, adding that the commission was not made aware of the event beforehand.
The statement, however, took note of the Indian government’s “commitment” towards the safety of Bangladeshi diplomatic posts in India.
Bangladesh also rejected “an attempt of the Indian authorities to depict an isolated attack on a Bangladeshi citizen, who happens to belong to the Hindu community, as attacks on minorities“.
The statement said that the government “promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident“. It noted that “the intercommunal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia”.
“Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,” the statement added.
Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, protesters, seeking the repatriation of Hasina, were stopped from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission.
A day earlier, India’s foreign ministry had conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country, following protests triggered by the killing of a prominent youth leader.</p><small>2025-12-22 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640862-lhc-suspends-implementation-of-punjab-property-ownership-ordinance' target='_blank'><strong>LHC suspends implementation of Punjab Property Ownership Ordinance</strong></a><br><p>

Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”.
The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine.
Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head of the Russian General Staff’s training department, was killed when the bomb, which had been placed under his parked car, detonated in a residential quarter of southern Moscow.
AFP reporters at the scene saw a mangled white Kia SUV, its doors and back window blown out. The frame was twisted and charred from the blast.
The scene had been cordoned off by security forces, and investigators were sifting through the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a loud bang.
“We absolutely didn’t expect it. We thought we were safe, and then this happens right next to us,” local resident, Tatiana, 74, told AFP.
“The windows rattled, you could tell it was an explosion,” said Grigory, 70, who also declined to give his surname.
“We need to treat it more calmly. It’s the cost of war,” he added.
Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was “working through various lines of enquiry into the murder. One of them involves the possible organisation of the crime by Ukrainian special services“.
Sarvarov fought in the Russian army’s campaigns in the North Caucasus, including Chechnya in the 1990s, according to his official biography on the defence ministry’s website.
He also commanded Russian forces in Syria in 2015-16.
Talks intensify
The Kremlin said Putin had been informed about Monday’s killing, which came after three days of talks in Miami as the United States intensifies its efforts to broker an end to the four-year war.
Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and US special envoy Steve Witkoff hailed “progress” in the negotiations on Sunday.
Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev also met with the US team, which included Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
Witkoff had also called those meetings “productive and constructive.”
An initial 28-point plan to end the war put forward by Trump adhered to Moscow’s core demands, triggering panic in Kyiv and European capitals.
Ukraine and its allies have since been working to refine the plan, though Kyiv says it is still being asked to make massive concessions, such as giving up the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed scepticism over whether Russia really wants to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands and decimated eastern and southern Ukraine.
The Kremlin on Monday also denied that it wanted to recreate the Soviet Union, seize the whole of Ukraine and more land in eastern Europe after Reuters reported that US intelligence had concluded Putin seeks much more than just control over eastern Ukraine.
Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has been blamed for several attacks targeting Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin personalities in Russia and in Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions.
General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy of the General Staff, was killed in a car blast near Moscow in April.
In December 2024, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, was killed when a booby-trapped electric scooter exploded in Moscow, an attack claimed by Ukraine’s SBU security service.
A Russian military blogger, Maxim Fomin, was killed when a statuette exploded in a Saint Petersburg café in April 2023.
And in August 2022, a car bomb killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640846-pakistan-rolls-out-247-digital-monitoring-system-to-speed-up-passport-processing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rolls out 24/7 digital monitoring system to speed up passport processing</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Neelum issued the ruling during a hearing of petitions by Abida Parveen and others that challenged decisions pertaining to property disputes taken under the ordinance. Through her interim order, she also suspended decisions taken under the new legislation to take away the possession of properties.
Expressing her disapproval of the law, she remarked: “Someone should inform the government that if this law remains in force, even Jati Umra (the Sharif family residence) could be vacated within half an hour.
“It appears that some people want to hold all powers.”
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The judge observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy.
“If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she added.
Justice Neelum further pointed out that in case of a deputy commissioner handing over the possession of an individual’s house to someone else under the new law, the affected person did not have the right to appeal.
“The new law does not allow the high court to grant a stay in such matters,” she noted.
The Punjab chief secretary and other government officials were present at the hearing today, but the Punjab advocate general did not appear before the court. The court was told that the principal law officer was ill.
On this explanation, Justice Neelum remarked that she, too, was ill and had been advised bed rest, but was in the court presiding over proceedings.
The CJ then said that a full bench would be constituted to further proceed on the matter adjourned the hearing.
Separately, a Punjab law officer explained to Dawn that the Punjab government could challenge the LHC’s interim order before the Supreme Court under its appellate jurisdiction.
The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the provincial government could approach the Federal Constitutional Court as well, since that case involved a question of law.
“The government may also request the proposed full bench to review the stay order. However, its chances of obtaining relief through that route are relatively slim,” he added.
The ordinance in question was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
It has been challenged before the LHC, and during a previous hearing on the matter, Justice Neelum had questioned the involvement of a newly-created force under the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority (Pera) in such matters.
She had also commented that “patwaris (revenue officials) and ACs (assistant commissioners) seem to have developed a desire to become judges”, and questioned the jurisdiction of a patwari to take cognisance of a matter already pending before the Supreme Court.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22071815af0e74e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962594/cdf-field-marshal-munir-awarded-king-abdulaziz-medal-for-his-efforts-to-advance-pak-saudi-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir awarded King Abdulaziz medal for his efforts to ‘advance Pak-Saudi ties’</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz has conferred the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class on Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his efforts to “advance Pak-Saudi ties”, it emerged on Monday.
According to a report by Saudi Gazette, the medal has five classes; excellent, first, second, third, and fourth. It is usually awarded to those who have rendered outstanding services to Saudi Arabia or one of its institutions.
The official Saudi Press Agency reported late on Sunday that CDF Field Marshal Munir was given the medal in honour of his “distinguished efforts to strengthen the strategic relationship and cooperation between the two nations”.
The report added that the ceremony took place during the Saudi minister’s reception of CDF Field Marshal Munir in Riyadh.
“Prince Khalid congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his appointment as Pakistan’s chief of defence forces, wishing him continued success in his new role,” the report added.
“During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the historical Saudi-Pakistani relations and the strategic cooperation in the defence field, discussing efforts to establish the foundations of international peace and security, as well as issues of common interest,” the publication reported.
Separately, in a post on the social media platform X, the minister said, “Upon the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king], I presented Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir with the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class for his distinguished efforts to enhance our cooperation and advance the Saudi-Pakistani relations.”







Later on Monday morning, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that during the meeting, the two sides held discussions on matters of mutual interest, including regional security dynamics, defence and military cooperation, strategic collaboration, and evolving geopolitical challenges.
“The interaction reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.







It further said that the medal was the kingdom’s “highest national honour”.
“The honour recognises Field Marshal Munir’s distinguished military service and leadership, as well as his central role in advancing defence cooperation, strategic coordination, and institutional linkages between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.
“It also reflects his contributions toward regional peace and stability, including sustained collaboration in counter-terrorism and security,” it added.
Earlier this year, Islamabad and Riyadh had signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In November, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
On December 3, Field Marshal Munir had also expressed satisfaction with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640825-punjab-lg-polls-to-be-on-party-basis-govt-assures-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab LG polls to be held on party basis, govt assures LHC</strong></a><br><p>

In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video.
The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics.
In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions.
However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said.
“Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said.
It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”.
Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family.
Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead.
He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”.
He said that while he and the other staff were treating over a dozen other patients, the attendants continued to “shout, abuse, threaten and harass” him, including getting physically violent.
“After repeated humiliation, verbal abuse, physical threats and four consecutive attempted attacks, it was impossible for any human being to remain unaffected,” the doctor said.
“My reaction was the result of continued provocation, not an unprovoked act. I state clearly that I did not abuse, misbehave or physically attack anyone. I did not utter a single word of profanity. My response was calm and disciplined,” he said.
“I admit that I was under severe mental stress and anger at that time. Protesting is a fundamental right of every individual and employee, and I exercised this right peacefully and non-violently,” he said.
He added that the hospital rules did not clearly refer to silent gestures as violations of the law, saying, “If I had used abusive language or physical assault, it would certainly have been a violation of medical ethics, but that was not the case.”
The doctor said that suspension without investigation was unfair and requested that he be reinstated in order to complete his training.</p><small>2025-12-22 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640813-karachi-likely-to-experience-noticeable-drop-in-temperature-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to experience noticeable drop in temperature from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Father and son Sajid Akram and Naveed are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, killing 15 people in the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.
Sajid, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, was moved from hospital to jail on Monday, police said.

 

Police documents released on Monday said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
Pictures were released showing the accused firing shotguns and moving in what authorities described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
And they made a nighttime “reconnaissance” trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
Australia observed a minute’s silence at 6:47pm (12:47pm PKT) on Sunday —exactly a week since the first reports of gunfire.
On Monday, Albanese said he would push for tough new laws creating “an aggravated offence for hate preaching”.
“We’re not going to let the ISIS inspired terrorists win. We won’t let them divide our society, and we’ll get through this together,” Albanese told reporters.
“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said.

 

“The government will work every day to protect Jewish Australians, to protect the fundamental right as Australians that they have to be proud of who they are, to practice their faith, to educate their children and to engage in Australian society in the fullest way possible,” he added.
Crackdown on guns, ‘terrorist symbols’
Australia’s federal government has flagged a suite of reforms to gun ownership and hate speech laws, as well as a review of police and intelligence services.
Albanese also announced last week a sweeping buyback scheme to “get guns off our streets”.
It is the largest gun buyback since 1996, when Australia cracked down on firearms in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 35 people at Port Arthur.
And the government of New South Wales — where the shooting took place — recalled its parliament for two days on Monday to introduce what it called the “toughest firearm reforms in the country”.
“We can’t pretend that the world is the same as it was before that terrorist incident on Sunday,” New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told reporters.
“I’d give anything to go back a week, a month, two years, to ensure that didn’t happen, but we need to make sure that we take steps so that it never happens again.”
The new rules will cap the number of guns an individual can own to four, or ten for exempted individuals like farmers.
There are more than 1.1 million firearms in the state, officials said.
The legislation would also ban the display of “terrorist symbols”, including the flag of the Islamic State, which was found in a car linked to one of the alleged shooters.
Authorities will also be able to prohibit protests for up to three months following a terrorism incident.

 

Minns said on Monday he would also look into stricter hate speech legislation next year, including restrictions on the phrase “globalise the intifada”.
The phrase is a common chant at pro-Palestinian rallies and refers to past uprisings against Israeli forces in the occupied territories.</p><small>2025-12-22 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640806-imrans-protest-call-negates-achakzais-dialogue-wish' target='_blank'><strong>Imran's protest call negates Achakzai's dialogue wish</strong></a><br><p>

Spot gold rose 1.2 per cent to a record $4,391.92 an ounce, while spot silver climbed 2.7opc by 0344GMT to hit a historic high of $69.23.
Bullion has gained 67pc so far this year, shattering multiple records and breaching the $3,000 and $4,000 per ounce milestones for the first time. It is poised for its biggest annual gain since 1979.
Silver has surged 138pc year-to-date, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by robust investment inflows and persistent supply constraints.
“With December usually producing positive returns for gold and silver, seasonality is on their side,” said StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson.
“Given that gold has already risen 4pc this month and we’re nearing the end of the year, bulls may want to tread with caution as volumes are to deplete and odds of profit-taking are also likely on the rise.”
Traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, gold has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions, steady central bank buying and expectations of lower interest rates next year.
A softer dollar has provided an additional tailwind by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.
Markets are currently pricing in two US rate cuts for next year despite the Federal Reserve signalling caution. Non-yielding assets such as gold tend to benefit in lower interest rate environments.
Simpson said two Fed rate cuts were pencilled in for 2026, with a faster US jobs slowdown and a shift to a more dovish Fed likely to add further upside to gold.

The directive was issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah while chairing a meeting of officials representing the KMC, zoo and relevant departments.
The meeting reviewed the existing conditions, management practices and future planning related to exotic animals housed at the zoo.
Mr Shah emphasised that the government was committed to ensuring animal welfare, ethical management and compliance with international best practices concerning captive wildlife.
He stated that uncontrolled breeding of exotic species, especially big cats, posed serious challenges in terms of animal welfare, space constraints, safety and long-term management, and needed to be addressed without delay.
During the meeting, the KMC and zoo authorities were directed to initiate immediate measures to halt the breeding of exotic animals and develop a clear, time-bound plan in consultation with qualified wildlife experts.

 

The chief secretary underscored the need for expert guidance to ensure that all actions taken were scientifically sound, humane and aligned with conservation principles.
He further instructed that a comprehensive assessment of existing exotic animals at the zoo be carried out, including their health, habitat conditions and future care requirements.
“The focus should remain on responsible wildlife management, discouraging unnecessary captivity and breeding of exotic animals, and promoting practices that prioritise animal well-being and public safety,” he noted during the meeting.
It might be recalled that three lion cubs were born at the zoo last month.

The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.

 

In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.

Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections

The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.

According to the programme circulated by the Privatisation Commission on Sunday, bids will be submitted between 10:45am and 11:15am, while bids will be opened at 3:30pm, a process that will be shown live on television networks, as decided by the government.
The three bidders are: a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Limited, Hub Power Holdings Lim­ited, Kohat Cement Com­pany Limited, and Metro Ventures (Private) Limi­ted; a consortium comprising Arif Habib Corporation Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, City Schools (Private) Limited, and Lake City Holdings (Private) Limited; and Air Blue (Private) Ltd.
Chairman of the Privatisation Commission and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said during a YouTube interview that Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd had decided to quit the bidding process for PIA.
Mr Ali explained that on Tuesday, after submission, the sealed bids will be placed in a transparent box, following which the board of the Privatisation Commission will meet and fix the reference price.
Thereafter, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) will meet and approve the reference price, which will be announced during the opening of the bids.
He further explained that if bids are higher than the reference price, there would be an open auction. However, if the bids are less than the reference price, priority will be given to the highest bidder.
About the next step, the adviser said that the federal cabinet will approve the transaction within days, followed by the signing of the documents which the Privatisation Commission has received from the bidders. After the signing of the documents, the commission will have 90 days to fulfill some procedures, including the transfer of properties, liabilities and leased aircraft.
Transaction structure
As per the transaction structure, the bidding will be on the basis of a 75 per cent stake in PIA. Out of the 75pc bidding amount, 92.5pc will go to PIA instead of the national exchequer, while only 7.5pc will go to the national exchequer.
He said 25pc of PIA shares will remain with the government, which will be a valuable asset. However, the successful bidder will have the option to acquire the remaining 25pc after payment or leave it with the government.
According to Mr Ali, the valuation of the remaining 25pc shares of PIA will take place after the decision on the 75pc stake. The government has given bidders the option to decide whether to pay for the remaining 25pc within 12 months with a 12pc premium.
The bidders will have to take a decision on the 75pc stake on Tuesday, whereas for acquiring the remaining 25pc , they would have to take a decision within 90 days.
He said the bidders had sought to make payment for the 75pc stake over one year; however, the government did not agree to this proposal. If the performance of PIA declines within a year, the bidder would decide against the purchase, and if performance improves, the bidder would decide in favour, which would be unfair to the government, he said.
He said the winning bidder will deposit two-thirds of the bid within 90 days, while the remaining one-third will be deposited within a year.
Mr Ali said the revival of PIA would have an impact on GDP growth and the economy as a whole.
Pakistan has the lowest contribution of the aviation industry to GDP. Compared to 18pc in the UAE and 8.5pc in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s aviation sector contributes only 1.3pc to GDP. However, due to the potential in PIA, this percentage would increase considerably, he said.
Of PIA’s 34-aircraft fleet, only 18 aircraft are currently in operation. However, PIA has air service agreements with 97 countries, besides landing rights in over 170 countries.

 

PIA’s current net profit is Rs11 billion, with equity of Rs30bn. He said liabilities of Rs26bn will remain with PIA, and bidders will pay these over five years.
About the employees, he said that under the proposed agreement, no employee can be fired for one year. Employees’ pensions and perks are fully protected, while the pension liabilities of retired employees, including medical benefits and discounted tickets, will be borne by the holding company.
He said that in 2011, PIA had 11,500 employees, which has now reduced to 6,500, a reduction of 5,000 employees over five years.
Mr Ali said PIA is such an asset that if not properly managed, colossal sums of money will be lost; however, if run with proper management, it could generate mammoth earnings. With a country of 250 million people, PIA has customers, destinations, routes and landing slots.
What is required, he said, is investment, the addition of aircraft and efficient management, which the government cannot provide.
The type of decision-making required at PIA can only be undertaken by the private sector, and if the airline is properly managed, PIA could return to its glory days, Mr Ali remarked.

The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017.
The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
“The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken.

Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69

Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.
“On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement.
“We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said.
UN chief condemns move
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s “relentless” expansion of settlements in the occupied territory.
It “continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State”, he said earlier this month.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel.
Sharp increase in settlements
A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data.

 

“These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.
“These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said.
Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.
Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago.
Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said.
While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government.
Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory.
US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank.
“Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

Under the initiative, farmers will be able to apply digitally through the Zarkheze app for financing of up to Rs1 million. After verification and agronomic assessment, applications will be forwarded to the bank chosen by the farmer for processing.
The programme provides that 75 per cent of the financing will be disbursed in kind for the purchase of agricultural inputs through banks’ pre-approved agri-vendors. Farmers will also receive advisory services through the Land Information Management System (LIMS).
Officials said the product was designed not only to provide financing but also to improve productivity by ensuring access to quality inputs and advisory services.
To encourage banks to increase lending to small farmers, the government has offered 10pc first-loss coverage and an operational cost subsidy of Rs10,000 per borrower for the net increase in banks’ outstanding borrowers.
Commenting on the initiative, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said it was part of the government’s push for financial inclusion and rural development, adding that it would support national food security goals.

 

SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said Zarkheze “is a pivotal step in improving the small farmers’ access to finance”.
He stressed that digitising the credit process would reduce hurdles for small farmers and make formal lending more accessible and timely, while also supporting the goal of promoting digital payments in the rural economy.
PBA Chairman Zafar Masud said the banking industry would continue to work closely with the Ministry of Finance and the SBP to expand outreach and streamline processes for farmers across the country.
“By leveraging advanced technology and innovative credit assessment methods, we aim to improve access to finance for smallholder, particularly landless, farmers operating within a largely undocumented sector,” he added.
The Zarkheze application is available on the Google Play Store. Farmers may also visit their nearest bank branch for assistance with digital onboarding.

Since 2015-18, the federal government has upgraded FBISE through a Rs50 million project, “Modernisation and Standardisation of Examination System.”
The project was a brainchild of Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.
According to documents, the project was completed in three years “with accomplishment of all set targets.” After completion of the project, the then PML-N government wanted to replicate it across the country. However, with the change of its government the plan could not be executed. 

Planning, education ministries and FBISE working on proposed project, says board chairman

According to documents, a series of meetings of the project steering committee represented by all provinces was held in 2018-19, but no tangible progress could be made due to lack of interest by the provinces.
“After completion of the PML-N tenure in 2018, the new government of PTI did not prioritise this project and provinces too did not show any seriousness and the project was surrendered in 2019,” said an official source.
He said now, once again, the Planning Ministry is headed by Ahsan Iqbal and Dr Ikram Ali Malik, who had executed the project from 2015-18, is the chairperson of FBISE. 
“So the government with the support of FBISE wants to provide same facilities and technology to all the 30 examination boards in the country,” the official said.
FBISE has completed concept papers for launching the new project and soon a presentation would be given to the planning minister. According to the working paper, the estimated cost of the project is Rs2 billion. Under the proposed project, three data centres with resources will be set up in provinces. Besides other facilities, provision of scanners and PC for scanning, customisation of software, delivery and training are part of the new project.
When contacted, the FBISE chairperson said on the direction of the federal government, the board was extending technical help to all the 30 boards. 
“Recently, we conducted a training workshop for all boards and we are also transferring technology to the boards. But for executing all the plan, new resources and manpower are required; therefore, a new project has been planned,” he said and added that in the new project all components of previous project of FBISE (2015-18) had been added in addition to new items.  
Sharing the details of new items, Dr Malik said the use of Artificial Intelligence in assessment process, introduction of verbal communication, certification on educational assessment for highly qualified persons, academic and resource audit, post-examination analyses and publication of examiner reports were part of the proposed project.
“Ministries of Planning, Education and FBISE are working closely on the proposed project and soon FBISE will give a briefing to planning minister in this regard,” he said. 
To a query about willingness of provinces, he said all provinces were excited to modernise their educational boards.
Recently, State Minister for Federal Education Wajiha Qamar while addressing participant of a workshop organised by FBISE called for forward-looking vision and introduction of technology-driven reforms in the national examination system. She said the government will always be supporting all educational boards in embracing digital transformation, which will lead to transparent, credible and student-centred examination processes.
