While the government has not made any statements regarding the sale of alcohol in recent days, the sources said non-Muslim individuals with so-called premium resident status are now able to buy booze at the country’s sole liquor store in Riyadh, which was previously reserved for diplomats.
AFP spoke with four people who said the rules had changed, including two diplomatic sources and a couple of residents with premium visa status.
“I heard about it from friends who tried it. I went there two days ago and it actually worked,” one premium visa-holder told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“It saved me a lot of money rather than buying from the black market. Prices are reasonable and we finally can buy alcohol.”
AFP reached out to Saudi authorities for comment on the reports, but they did not respond by the time the story was published.
Started in 2019, premium resident status in Saudi Arabia is available to a select group of foreigners who meet a variety of requirements, including making a one-time payment of 800,000 riyals ($213,000).
The visa allows people to live, work and invest freely in Saudi Arabia without a local “sponsor” — a kind of guarantor required for other non-nationals to live in the kingdom.
A premium residency-holder told AFP that he went to the liquor store and saw a man with the same status purchase alcohol before buying bottles himself.
“It actually worked for me, it’s so easy,” he said.
‘Walking out with 30 bottles’
A Western diplomat told AFP that acquaintances of his with premium residency had managed to buy alcohol in the past few days.
“Expats WhatsApp groups are being flooded with the news,” he added.
A diplomat told AFP that “the [liquor] store was packed” on Saturday, when she saw “people walking out with 30 bottles”.
 
 

The apparent loosening of the liquor regulations comes nearly two years after the kingdom opened its first and only liquor store in January 2024 in the capital’s diplomatic quarter, catering exclusively to non-Muslim foreign envoys.
There was no official announcement at the time, with two sources confirming the reports to AFP at the time.
Since the rise to power of Saudi Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom has undergone steady changes in accordance with its plan to diversify the economy and attract tourists and international business.
Women are now allowed to drive, foreign tourists are being welcomed and cinemas have reopened.
The ban on alcohol is still in place, a measure not uncommon in Muslim countries, where alcohol use is often restricted.</p><small>2025-11-24 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24170311550018f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957085/ash-cloud-from-ethiopian-volcano-eruption-expected-to-reach-southern-pakistan-advisory-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Ash cloud from Ethiopian volcano eruption expected to reach southern Pakistan: advisory centre</strong></a><br><p>An ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in northeastern Ethiopia is expected to reach southern Pakistan after drifting over Yemen and Oman, the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. This was the first recorded eruption in nearly 12,000 years.
The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14 kilometres into the sky, blanketing nearby villages and drifting toward the Arabian Sea region.
The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.
 






A local resident told The Addis Standard that the eruption occurred eight kilometres from the main mountain itself.
“Afar TV … described a “massive eruption” late in the morning, noting that the force and sound of the blast were stronger than any previous events recalled by residents,” the Standard reported.
“‘We were extremely shocked by the sound and engulfed in fear,’ one resident said. Phone interviews conducted by the station indicated that the sound and its effects were felt as far away as Djibouti, Tigray and towns in the Wollo area.”
The Standard reported that the explosion caused tremors in the surrounding area and could be heard as far away as Djibouti. The subsequent ash cloud plunged surrounding settlements into “near-darkness”.

Citing Dutch news agency BNO News, The Standard said that the eruption began at 8:30am UTC (1:30pm PKT) and explosions continued throughout the afternoon.
“An advisory from the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said ash rose to about 45,000 feet (13.7 km) before activity subsided,” the Ethiopian outlet reported, adding that according to the latest VAAC update they received, the eruption had reportedly stopped.
The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the Holocene, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.
Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University, confirmed on Bluesky that Hayli Gubbi “has no record of Holocene eruptions”.
An update from flight tracking monitor FlightRadar at 3:31am this morning showed the projected path of the ash cloud, which was being blown towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea.
Pakistan will come directly in its path, the monitor showed in its post, stating that the cloud would arrive in approximately 18 hours.
 






An interactive map from VAAC shows that the ash cloud will pass over southern Sindh before heading northeast into India.

With the ban recently being declared “illegal and void” by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Adjudicator, Salman has already gotten back to work.
“We feel that justice has been served,” Salman told Dawn in a phone call while attending an overseas conference.
“And now, I’ll continue with the work I’m doing,” added Salman, who serves as the Asian Director of Development for World Athletics.
The Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP) imposed a lifetime ban on Salman on October 12, citing “gross violations of the AFP Constitution” due to “illegal and unconstitutional” elections held by the Punjab Athletics Association (PAA), of which Salman was president till August 6. The ban barred Salman from participating in any athletics activities nationally or internationally.
Salman appealed the ban, and PSB appointed Senator Pervaiz Rashid as adjudicator to the case.
In the meantime, Salman was cleared to travel with Arshad to the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh, where the 28-year-old defended his gold medal.
A hearing held on November 13 — the final order of which was made available today — declared that “imposing a lifetime ban is without lawful authority, unconstitutional, ultra vires, and void ab initio.”
“AFP’s attempt to unilaterally declare PAA’s elections as ‘null and void’ is without jurisdiction, as election supervision lies with the provincial authorities and not AFP.
The order further stated that examination of the AFP Constitution revealed that “there is no provision authorising a lifetime ban upon an individual coach.”
The order also stated that no formal charge sheet was issued to the petitioner, nor was an inquiry report provided to Salman or a meaningful right of hearing or defence afforded.
The petitioner’s submissions regarding PAA elections, his coaching credentials, and the adverse impact on national athletes are supported by the record, the order stated.
“Accordingly, the lifetime ban has no legal effect and is declared void.”
PSB directed AFP to immediately withdraw all adverse communications sent to any national or international bodies regarding the ban. It also restored all “professional rights, status, and privileges” of Salman as a national athletics coach.
“AFP is restrained from issuing defamatory or prejudicial communications regarding the petitioner in future,” the order read.
It also took into account the impact on Arshad, who had written to the Pakistan Olympics Association (POA) on Oct 17 and endorsed support for Salman.
“AFP’s actions disrupted Pakistan’s high-performance preparations, created uncertainty for a leading Olympic athlete, damaged national medal prospects, risked reputational harm internationally,” the order read.
“Such actions are inconsistent with responsible governance of national sports federations.”
The order stated that circulating the ban to international bodies, including World Athletics and Asian Athletics, resulted in damage to Salman’s international standing and perception of Pakistan in global forums.
“Violation of norms of transparency and responsible international communication, AFP’s conduct is found to be improper, premature, and harmful to Pakistan’s sporting reputation.”</p><small>2025-11-24 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24142030e89577d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957065/judges-transfer-case-fcc-rejects-intra-court-appeal-filed-by-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>Judges transfer case: FCC rejects intra-court appeal filed by IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Monday rejected on Monday a set of intra-court appeals, including one filed by five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges in a judges transfer case, for non-prosecution.
The case pertains to the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital, and the IHC judges had challenged a decision by the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court to uphold the transfers.
However, the appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Amendment.
A six-member FCC bench, headed by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah, took up nine appeals pertaining to the case today.
As the proceedings began, the court associate called out the names of each of the lawyers representing different clients, and when they did not appear, the FCC dismissed six of those appeals one at a time, dictating separate orders for each plea.
The rejected appeals included the one filed by IHC Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri. These judges were also not present at the hearing.
Apart from the appeal moved by the five judges through senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, the FCC also took up pleas filed by Tahir Faraz Abbasi through Advocate Abid Shahid Zuberi, Raja Muqsit Nawaz Khan and PTI founder Imran Khan through counsel Idrees Ashraf, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and Lahore Bar Association (LBA) through counsel Hamid Khan, and the Karachi Bar Association, Muhammad Shoaib Shaheen and Riasat Ali Azad through counsel Faisal Siddiqi.
From these nine appeals, the FCC adjourned the hearing on three pleas for an indefinite period.
Among them was also Imran’s plea, whose counsel Ashraf sought directives for meeting the incarcerated former prime minister. He argued that he needed instructions from Imran after the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The counsel pleaded that he had to file additional grounds since he had moved the appeal against the SC’s short order. Therefore, he argued, a meeting with the client was necessary.
However, Justice Aminuddin rejected the request, observing that the counsel should approach the forum that sentenced his client. Justice Aminuddin said the matter did not fall in the FCC’s domain.
But, the counsel argued that a directive by the FCC would “fulfil the requirement of complete justice” under Article 187 of the Constitution.
During the hearing, Advocate Ajmal Toor appeared before the court on behalf of senior counsel Hamid Khan, who is representing the LHCBA and LBA.
Advocate Toor sought more time from the court as Hamid was unavailable.
The court then also adjourned the hearing on the pleas of the two lawyers’ bodies for an indefinite period.
Pleas on judges transfer
On June 19, the now-defunct CB issued a 3-2 majority judgement, declaring that the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three other courts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The judgement was issued on petitions challenging the transfers of Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court to the IHC.
The controversy centred around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the senior puisne judge, which paved the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC. Justice Dogar is now the IHC chief justice.
The five IHC judges had challenged the June 19 decision and filed an intra-court appeal.
The judges contended in the appeal that the June 19 order impermissibly read in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued, adding that independence of the judiciary did not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
For his part, Imran’s petition on the issue argued that the June 19 judgment had eroded the safeguards aimed at preserving judicial independence since it circumvented the constitutionally enshrined appointment process.
On Saturday, the five IHC judges also filed a miscellaneous petition, challenging the fixing of their appeal before the FCC.
In the petition, the judges asked the FCC to return the intra-court appeal to the SC, arguing that the matter constitutionally fell within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
The petition stated that the appeal was shifted to the FCC under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, but contended that the amendment itself contradicted the Constitution.
In their application, the petitioners also argued that the Constitution clearly outlined the legislature, executive, and judiciary as the three essential pillars of the state and delineated limits and powers for each.
It was also fixed for hearing today. However, as the judge’s main appeal was dismissed, there was no occasion to take up the miscellaneous application.</p><small>2025-11-24 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635229-pakistan-saudi-arabia-ink-justice-sector-mou-as-tarar-attends-riyadh-global-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia ink justice-sector MoU as Tarar attends Riyadh global conference</strong></a><br><p>

Already home to over 241.5 million people, Pakistan’s population is projected to surpass 300 million within five years and approach 400 million by 2050.
Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund shows the average annual growth rate — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent, resulting in the population of 241.5 million, making Pakistan the fifth most populous country in the world.
The consequences of this growth are visible across every sector, such as malnutrition and a demand for jobs, infrastructure and healthcare that cannot be kept up with.
Here are some statistics from across the country.
National
The total fertility rate, defined as the average number of children a woman has during her reproductive age, is 3.6, which is the highest amongst countries in South Asia.
This high fertility contributes to issues of malnutrition, where 40pc of children under the age of five are stunted, 18pc are wasted, and 29pc are underweight.
At least 11,000 maternal deaths occur annually, though 3,800 mothers can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 34pc to 52pc.
Similarly, with respect to the infant mortality rate, 62 infants die before reaching one year of age per 1,000 live births, equating to 140,000 infants annually; however, infants can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 34pc to 52pc.
 


 


Punjab
Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, has an estimated population of 127.7 million (as of 2023), growing at an average annual rate of 2.53pc.
Projections indicate the population could more than double to 253 million by 2050 if the current total fertility rate of 3.4 children per woman persists.
The province faces a rate of 5,200 annual maternal deaths, alongside an infant mortality rate of 73 per 1,000 live births. Increasing contraceptive use from the current 41pc to 59pc is projected to save 2,300 mothers and 73,000 infants annually.
Currently, 15.8pc of the population has an unmet need for family planning, which corresponds to couples of child-bearing age who are not using contraception but desire to, resulting in an average of one unintended child per couple.
This high fertility rate is also a key factor in the prevalence of malnutrition, with 23.5pc of children under five years of age reported as underweight.
 


 


Sindh
Sindh, while having a smaller estimated population of 55.7 million (2017-2023), is growing marginally faster than Punjab at 2.57pc; it has a higher total fertility rate of 3.6, projecting a population of 111.5m by 2050.
Sindh records 3,000 maternal deaths annually and has an infant mortality rate of 60 per 1,000 live births.
Furthermore, the unmet need for family planning stands at 17.7pc in Sindh, directly contributing to high rates of malnutrition, as evidenced by the staggering 50pc children being stunted in the province.
 


 


Balochistan
Balochistan, faced with a rapidly growing population, sees an increasing demand for food, schools, health facilities, jobs, and infrastructure.
The average annual growth rate of the population is 3.20pc (2017 to 2023), with the population being 14.9m as of 2023.
By 2050, it is estimated that the population of Balochistan will be 35.3m at the current rate of fertility decline. The total fertility rate is 4.0, representing the average number of children a woman has during her reproductive age.
Maternal mortality is a significant concern, with 1,000 maternal deaths occurring annually.
It is projected that 400 mothers can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 20pc to 41pc. The infant mortality rate is also high, with 48 infants dying before reaching one year of age per 1,000 live births. Increasing contraceptive use from 20pc to 41pc could save 10,000 infants.
Additionally, 27pc of children under the age of five are underweight, indicating that high fertility contributes to malnutrition.
 


 


Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s population is growing at an average annual rate of 2.38pc, having reached an estimated 40.9m in 2023, with projections suggesting it could rise to 78m by 2050 if current fertility trends continue.
The province records around 1,900 maternal deaths each year, though it is estimated that increasing contraceptive use from 25pc to 54pc could save 800 mothers annually.
The total fertility rate stands at 4.0 children per woman. Infant mortality remains high, with 53 deaths per 1,000 live births and an estimated 16,700 infants who could be saved if contraceptive use increased from 28pc to 54pc.
High fertility is also linked to malnutrition, and 23pc of children under five are underweight.

The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and Chief of General Staff (CGS), Saudi Armed Forces General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR.
“During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said.
“They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added.
The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi Armed Forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”.
“Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement.
In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
Earlier this month, CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p><small>2025-11-24 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/241213331e76aeb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957054/pm-shehbaz-congratulates-pml-n-candidates-for-brilliant-success-in-by-elections' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz congratulates PML-N candidates for ‘brilliant success’ in by-elections</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated PML-N candidates on Monday for their overwhelming win in yesterday’s by-polls, which were held amid an election boycott by the opposition PTI in all constituencies except for two, low voter turnout and rigging allegations.
According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies.
Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases.
In separate but similar statements, PM Shehbaz congratulated the PML-N candidates for their victories in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), and Faisalabad’s PP-98, PP-116 and PP-115.
 






The statements issued by the PM’s Office said the premier congratulated the candidates for their “brilliant success”.
The statements quoted him as saying that the PML-N’s success in the by-polls was a result of party supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision and “exemplary leadership”, as well as the hard work of party workers.
“The success in the by-elections reflects public trust in Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s hard work for the progress of people of the province,” he said, adding that the public had expressed confidence in the PML-N during the by-polls.
 






“The success in elections is a reflection of the public confidence in the government’s performance,” he reiterated.
Separately, he mentioned the PML-N’s win in NA-143 (Sahiwal), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and NA-129 (Lahore), saying that the people expressed confidence in the “PML-N’s objectives of development, stability, and public welfare” during the by-elections.
 






Here, too, he credited Nawaz’s leadership and Maryam’s hard work for these wins.
Nawaz himself also offered congratulations to the party’s winners.
 






PTI alleges polling discrepancies in Haripur
On Monday morning, the provisional results for NA-18 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur were also issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), according to which PML-N’s Babar Nawaz Khan secured victory with 163,996 votes.
The Form-47 for the constituency — the provisional consolidated statement of results for vote count of all polling stations prepared by the returning officer (RO) concerned — showed that PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub was the first runner-up with 120,220 votes.
Shehrnaz is the wife of PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the NA opposition leader. The seat had fallen vacant following Ayub’s disqualification.
Shehrnaz had contested the polls against PML-N’s Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk with the “kettle” symbol. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings.
 
 

Speaking to reporters today, Ayub rejected the results and said he would challenge them before a court tribunal and launch a series of peaceful protests.
“The returning officer (RO) stole our election,” he alleged, asserting that his wife was ahead of her PML-N rival by over 27,000 votes from over 500 polling stations.
The PTI leader said that their candidate’s results were changed: “We have the Form-45s of all polling stations but the results compiled by the RO and displayed on screen were totally different.”
In an earlier video statement, Ayub had said that the RO was “refusing to accept the original Form-45s and saying he will only acknowledge the forms brought to him”.
“They have prepared duplicate Form-45s,” Ayub alleged.
 






Senior PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser also “rejected” the by-election results in a statement and termed the voting process “fraudulent and ridden by rigging”.
He described the by-polls as a “flagrant violation of the constitutional rules for conducting the voting process in the country”.
Qaiser said the handling of the by-election reflected “open rigging and has once again exposed its dark face before the nation“.
In a separate post on X, Qaiser claimed that the Form-45s showed Shehrnaz was leading by a margin of 25,000 votes from 519 polling stations. However, the ECP staff was “uploading the wrong results on the official website”, he alleged, raising serious questions over the transparency and credibility of the electoral process.
 






Taking note of the low voter turnout in other constituencies, the PTI leader also claimed that the public heeded the party’s call to boycott those by-elections.
He said that reports indicated that voter turnout remained between 15 and 18 per cent, while “over 80pc of citizens rejected the polls, opting to stay home”.
Qaiser termed the elections unrepresentative and demanded that the “non-transparent” results be annulled immediately. He claimed that the present government and the ECP “failed to provide an environment” where citizens could freely choose their leadership.
The former speaker further said that practices of “abductions, arrests, intimidation, restrictions on campaigning, voter manipulation, and tampering with Form-47 are routine” for the ECP.
 






Yesterday, Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz, citing the “posting of presiding officers, other polling staff and changing our election symbol”.
Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including CM Maryam’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Other by-election results
According to provisional results, PML-N candidates emerged victorious in NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-87 (Mianwali-III), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
The provisional results for NA-96 (Faisalabad-II) showed PML-N’s Bilal Badar Chaudhry, the brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, won the race with 93,009 votes.
He was competing against 15 aspirants, among whom independent candidate Nawab Sher bagged 43,025 votes to come out as the first runner-up.
 






For PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), the Form-47 showed that PML-N’s Azad Ali Tabassum had secured victory, bagging 44,388 votes and beating independent candidate Muhammad Ajmal by a margin of 9,142 ballots.
The PPP, which had contested in Haripur’s NA-18, DG Khan’s NA-185 and Muzaffargarh’s PP-269, managed to emerge victorious on the Muzaffargarh provincial seat.
The ruling PML-N had not fielded any candidate against PPP’s Alamdar Qureshi in the constituency, which was among the by-elections boycotted by the PTI, paving the way for the PPP’s win.
 






Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, said on social media platform X yesterday that if the PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, it would “not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future”.
“In other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!” the election expert added.

After decades of troubled relations, Islamabad and Dhaka have seen improved ties and increased bilateral engagement since the August 2024 ouster of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.
The deadline for submission of price offers is 11:30am on November 28, according to the TCP tender issued on November 20, which was seen by Dawn.
The tender invites “separate sealed bids” from companies, partnerships and sole proprietors for buying 100,000 tonnes of long grain white rice (IRRI-6) “for export to Bangladesh in the shape of break bulk cargo” through Karachi ports.
Price offers have to be valid for 21 working days after submission. The rice must be available for shipment within 45 days after the contract award.
The bids shall be submitted for a minimum quantity of 25,000 tonnes, or multiples thereof, and a maximum quantity of 100,000 tonnes, +/- 5 per cent MOLSO (5pc variance margin).
 
 

As per the tender, the rice should be supplied from the “stocks of latest crop of Pakistan origin”, and must be fit for human consumption without any unpleasant odour, sign of mould, poisonous weed seeds, insects, and infestation.
According to Reuters, traders regarded the tender as a possible move to bring Pakistani rice into Bangladesh’s import supplies, with market expectations that Indian-origin rice will be used to supply some recent purchases by Bangladesh.
Bangladesh also announced another rice tender today, continuing a series of import tenders in the last few weeks to cool local prices.
Pakistan and Bangladesh started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice.
At the 9th Joint Economic Commission (JEC) last month, Pakistan offered the use of Karachi Port Trust as a gateway for Dhaka’s trade with regional countries, including China and the Central Asian states.
Rice exports
Pakistan’s rice exports fell 28pc in the first quarter of FY26, raising concerns within the sector about policy and regulatory barriers that continue to undermine competitiveness.
A Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan official had attributed the decline to India’s 2024 decision to resume rice exports, remove the basmati minimum export price (MEP), and zero-rate rice exports.
 
 

However, as Pakistani exporters avoided a direct price war, India’s re-entry failed to significantly disrupt Pakistan’s rice trade in the following six months (October 2024 to March 2025), with the latter retaining its foothold in high-end markets.
Moreover, a 50 per cent tariff imposed by the United States on Indian goods, including basmati rice, in August has provided Pakistan an opportunity to expand its share in the American market.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform showed that between November 2023 and October 2024, the US accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports.</p><small>2025-11-24 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635193-cm-maryam-says-pti-boycotted-by-polls-after-sensing-defeat' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam says PTI boycotted by-polls after sensing defeat</strong></a><br><p>

The attack occurred on one of the city’s busiest roads just after 8am. Video footage of the incident showed one terrorist, clad in a chaddor, approaching the gate and detonating himself. Seconds later, two other terrorists tried to enter the compound.
The attack occurred as an assembly for the first working day of the week was being held at the main compound.
“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate, while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said while speaking to reporters.
He further said that three FC men had been martyred in the suicide attack at the gate, while two others were injured. He added that a clearance operation had been carried out.
Asked whether a threat alert had been issued prior to the incident, the police official said, “You are aware of the overall situation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the country, so we are on high alert. They were unable to enter [the headquarters] due to this alertness. They were neutralised at the gate.”
The Jamatul Ahrar faction of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.
The paramilitary force, originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary, was renamed by the government in July. The headquarters of the force is located in a crowded area, close to a military cantonment. The headquarters building houses barracks, hospitals, and residential quarters.
Meanwhile, an emergency was declared at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar’s largest public sector hospital, and Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH).
The spokesmen of the hospitals confirmed that 11 injured had been brought to LRH while one injured person had been brought to KTH.
Today’s incident is the second major terrorist attack on a security installation in Peshawar in the last three years. In February 2023, 84 people were killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines.
Terror attack condemned
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office.
“Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured.
He reaffirmed that the government remained resolute in eradicating terrorism, and vowed to crush any terrorist plots against Pakistan.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.
He affirmed that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.
 






Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to the TTP.
In a statement condemning the attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the sacrifices of the martyred personnel would always be remembered.
Naqvi also paid tribute to the “brave soldiers of FC, who foiled the Fitna-Al-Khwarij attack by taking timely action”. He also expressed “heartfelt sympathies for the families of the martyred”.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, paid tribute to the martyrs and security forces, stressing that “such cowardly attacks can not weaken our morale”.
Their sacrifice would not go in vain, he said, vowing to bring the terrorists to justice and continuing the war against terrorism with a “stronger resolve”.
CM Afridi affirmed that the provincial government stood with the police and law enforcement agencies, adding that “every resource available will be utilised to eliminate terrorism”.
The chief minister directed authorities to treat the injured and prayed for the families of the martyrs.
Later, he attended the funeral prayers of the martyred personnel, a statement issued by the CM’s Office said.
It added that CM Afridi paid tribute to the martyrs and said that their sacrifices “strengthen our resolve against terrorism”.
 






He also visited LRH before attending the funeral prayers and spoke to the media.
The CM said,“Terrorists have always intended to disturb peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan […]Those who will resort to this are our and Pakistan’s enemies, and we will not let them do this.
“They cannot weaken our resolve and courage.”
Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi said: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.”
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi posted on X that he “strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist attack on the FC Headquarters in Peshawar. Such acts of violence are an affront to the peace and security of our nation”.
“I commend the swift and courageous response of the FC personnel, which successfully prevented a greater tragedy. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs, and pray for the swift and full recovery of all those injured in this attack.
“Let there be no doubt: neither cowardly attacks nor external threats can weaken our resolve. The entire nation, and especially the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he added.
 






In its condemnation, the PTI termed the attack “unfortunate”. The party posted on X that it extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured.
“We salute the sacrifices of our security institutions and are standing with them for the protection of our country,” the party’s statement read.
 






PPP’s Sherry Rehman also condemned the attack. “Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs. We all laud the courageous defenders from our security forces whose vigilance prevented the suicide bombers from going inside to pursue their nefarious goals,” she said in a post on X.
“No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve,” she said.
 






PPP Chairperson and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack, saying that “such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve” to end terrorism.
A statement on the PPP’s official X account further quoted him as saying: “The PPP will continue its struggle for the elimination of terrorism, safety of the people and lasting peace in the country.
“Our nation’s unity, courage and resolve against terrorism will ensure the failure of every conspiracy by terrorists.”
Bilawal also paid tribute to the martyred FC personnel and said their “sacrifices will not go in vain”. He prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, as well as for those injured in the attack, the statement said.
 






Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on X: “I unequivocally condemn this morning’s despicable terrorist attack on the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Peshawar, which claimed the lives of three brave personnel and left two others wounded. My deepest condolences go to the bereaved families of the shaheeds (martyrs), and I pray for the early recovery of the injured.”
He further said, “Although terrorism has intensified in recent years, a disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks with first the Cadet College in Wana, then the blast at Islamabad’s district courts, and now this assault on the FC Headquarters. These are not random acts, they are part of a calculated campaign by enemies of Pakistan who are exploiting our vulnerabilities.”
The senator asserted that “at this critical juncture, the country expects complete transparency, effective intelligence coordination, and decisive action so that those who plan and finance these attacks are brought to justice, no matter where the trail leads. We want our troops and law enforcement agencies to focus singularly on eliminating the menace of the TTP and its affiliates.”
 






Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Today’s incident comes less than three months after a similar one in September, during which six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Bannu.
According to the military, the attack was carried out by “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij”.

Karachi’s road networks have been in shambles with thoroughfares riddled with potholes, posing serious dangers to commuters across the city, particularly after the latest spell of rains.
According to a statement by CM Sindh’s spokesperson, Abdul Rashid Channa, a meeting on the reconstruction of Karachi’s roads and streets was chaired by CM Murad today. Minister for Local Government Nasir Shah, Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, Senior Member Board of Revenue Khalid Haider Shah, among others, also participated.
 






“After heavy rains, Karachi’s roads are in a state of disrepair,” CM Murad was quoted as saying. “Mega projects are underway, causing traffic problems. I want development work to be accelerated in the city so that people do not suffer further.”
Mayor Wahab stated that 315 internal streets of the city were in a state of disrepair. The CM ordered that all internal street schemes be approved and that work be done quickly.
He also instructed the authorities concerned to ensure a regular drainage system is made in the streets being constructed, along with one on the 60 important highways, as per the statement.
Mayor Wahab briefed that the cost of Karachi’s development work was estimated at Rs25 billion. “Funds are not the issue; I want immediate and quality work for the citizens,” the CM was quoted as saying.
CM Murad congratulated the mayor on the inauguration of reverse-osmosis RO plants in Keamari. “We have to ensure clean water, good roads and excellent law and order for the people,” he said, adding that traffic accidents in the city have decreased since the launch of the Sindh Safe City Project.
In March, Mayor Wahab had demanded that the federal government provide Rs25 bn to strengthen the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) so that the development of the megacity could be ensured.</p><small>2025-11-24 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2412525222fa732.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957060/in-pictures-aftermath-of-suicide-attack-on-fc-headquarters-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Aftermath of suicide attack on FC headquarters in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>Three Federal Constabulary (FC) personnel were martyred while two others were injured on Monday in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar.

• Questions why auditor general’s office remains attached to federal secretariat
• Audit process bogged down by over 6,000 reports a year, minimal PAC follow-up
ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concern over the absence of an internal audit mechanism and weak constitutional and parliamentary audit supervision in Pakistan, warning that these gaps pose major fiduciary risks to public funds estimated at about Rs40 trillion at the federal level and even higher in the provinces.
It has called for a fully independent Office of the Auditor Gen­eral of Pakistan (AGP) to ensure better value for taxpayers’ money.
 
 

In a detailed section in its Governance & Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA), the IMF has identified a series of weaknesses in Pakistan’s internal financial controls, internal and external audit systems and practical subservience of the AGP to the executive despite its constitutional autonomy, besides insufficient capacity and role of the parliamentary oversight through the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
It is therefore unsurprising that cases of financial irregularities, embezzlement and corruption running into trillions of rupees continue to surface year after year.
The Fund said an effective internal control system was essential for creating an environment that ensured appropriate decision-making regarding the use of public resources, with clear accountability for such decisions, including via administrative structures, as well as external oversight by a supreme audit institution and the legislature.
“Both internal and external audits are vital in maintaining the integrity of an organisation’s operations and financial reporting, thereby reducing the risk of corruption,” the Fund observed and highlighted a series of weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
Saying that internal audit was weak in Pakistan, the report noted that the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2019 required the creation of a Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) in each division to work directly with principal accounting officers no later than 2020.
“Despite this provision, there has been no implementation and appointment of CIAs,” the IMF said.
It said that 25 chief finance and accounts officers (CFAOs) were working in ministries for financial management — a distinct role — but CIAs have not been posted in all ministries and divisions and CFAOs are also missing in 15 ministries and divisions. The full implementation of the PFM Act 2019 still remains a dream after six years.
“In addition, ministries and divisions with CFAOs lack consistency, interest, and follow-up on the findings of internal audit reports,” it said. The Fund also questioned why the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was still operating as an attached institution of the Federal Secretariat, which resulted in a lack of full independence.
According to Article 171 of the Constitution and Article 7 of the Pakistan Audit Ordinance, 2001, the AGP has to attest the Appropriation accounts and financial statements of federal, provincial and local governments’ entities and the certified accounts and financial statements of the federal and provincial/local governments are submitted to the president and the governors of provinces, respectively.
“Due to its status as an attached institution, the Auditor General does not report directly to the parliament but instead through the Federal Secretariat, the prime minister, and the president. This indirect reporting structure can potentially compromise the independence and objectivity of the audit process,” it said.
In addition, as an attached institution, the OAG has to obtain approval from the federal Public Service Commission to hire auditors. The OAG complained to the IMF that they faced a significant staffing shortage — a deficit of 1,500 staff members — mainly due to fiscal constraints preventing necessary government approvals for hiring.
Despite the fact that the budget of the Auditor General is classified as charged expenditure, which means it is not subject to a parliamentary vote, the OAG still needs to adhere to budget execution rules. Consequently, they are subject to budget releases by the Finance Division, subject to cash availability.
“This dependency on the Federal Secretariat for budget releases further limits the OAG’s operational independence”, critically important for Supreme Audit Institutions to perform their tasks as needed and required, it said.
As if that was not enough, the effectiveness of the audit process was further being undermined by the excessively long reports that contain repetitive recommendations and the lack of timely review by the PAC.
The Office of the Auditor General produced over 6,000 reports each year, but there was minimal or no follow-up from the Public Account Committee and the ministries and divisions. “As a result, 75 per cent of the 34,000 recommendations made by the Supreme Audit Institution are still pending discussion in the PAC.
Moreover, it pointed out that the audit reports were often too lengthy, with some reaching up to thousands of pages that included repetitive recommendations for years since these irregularities identified in the reports are not addressed by the executive agencies. For instance, the Federal Government Compliance Audit Report for FY2023-24 is 4,000 pages long.
On top of that, there are no systems in place for monitoring the response to or compliance with audit findings and recommendations, which further diminishes the impact and effectiveness of the audit process.
The IMF demanded the development of a system that could make executive authority responsible and accountable in case of non-compliance with audit recommendations as well as PAC directions.
For this, the lender suggested making appropriate amendments to the PAC regulations and AGP Act to empower these institutions to ensure compliance with their directives.
Going forward, the IMF also demanded streamlining audit reports by including concise recommendations for the most critical issues and organising findings by their impact and urgency, using visual tools like traffic light systems to indicate the severity of issues.
In addition, the Fund also demanded strengthening of the parliamentary oversight by mandating the PAC to review audit reports promptly, supported by a tracking system on implementation progress through a centralised secretariat for monitoring and improved transparency and accountability.

On Friday, India’s Tejas fighter jet crashed in a ball of fire in front of horrified spectators during an aerial display at the Dubai Airshow.
The Indian Air Force has said it is setting up a court of inquiry to investigate the cause.
 
 

State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics manufactures the aircraft, which is powered by General Electric engines. Both companies have said they will support the investigation.
Tejas, which means brilliance in Sanskrit, is seen as crucial for India’s efforts to modernise its air force fleet of mainly Russian and ex-Soviet fighters.
The crash, which killed the pilot, dampens New Delhi’s hopes of exporting the home-built jet and leaves it reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of domestic defence technology.
Such a public loss could overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts have said.
Hindustan Aeronautics said on Monday that the crash will not affect its business operations, financials or future deliveries.
Shares of the company, which were trading three per cent lower since morning, were unchanged after the statement.</p><small>2025-11-24 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24113556363af6e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957051/canada-india-agree-to-restart-trade-talks-new-delhi-says' target='_blank'><strong>Canada, India agree to restart trade talks, New Delhi says</strong></a><br><p>Canada and India have agreed to restart stalled talks for a new trade deal, the Indian government said on Sunday, after discussions between the two countries paused following a diplomatic spat two years ago.
Prime Minister Mark Carney met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a bilateral discussion on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa.
“The leaders agreed to begin negotiations on a high-ambition Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), aimed at doubling bilateral trade to USD 50 billion by 2030,” the statement from India’s Prime Minister’s Office said.
“PM Modi and I met at the G20 summit today, and launched negotiations for a trade deal that could more than double our trade to more than C$70 billion,” Carney said in a post on social media platform X.
“India is the world’s fifth largest economy, and that means big new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.”
 






Both sides reaffirmed their longstanding civil nuclear cooperation and noted the ongoing discussions on expanding collaboration, including through long-term uranium supply arrangements, it added.
The restart of talks highlights thawing relations between the two countries as Carney pushes to expand trade ties beyond the United States, its biggest trading partner.
Carney has vowed to double Canada’s non-US exports over the next decade.
Canada paused negotiations for a broad trade pact in 2023 after relations soured when Ottawa accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh separatist. New Delhi has denied involvement.
Despite the diplomatic row, trade between Canada and India has grown but trade experts say it is quite small relative to the size of India’s economy.
Two-way goods and services trade touched about C$31bn ($21.98bn) in 2024, largely in Canada’s favour due to its C$16bn in services exports. In contrast, Canada’s total bilateral trade with China was almost four times bigger in 2024.
Relations between Canada and India began to improve following Modi’s meeting with Carney on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.
Earlier on Sunday, Carney said he considers India a reliable trading partner, although he acknowledged there could be some “source of friction”.
He said Canada and India have a strong commercial relationship and he would be keen to scale that up.
“What we’re looking to do is to put that (commercial relationship) on a sound footing through a potential trade agreement between the two countries, which gives protections to our businesses, protections to Indian businesses, a clear set of rules, dispute mechanisms, and others, and build on those opportunities.”

Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said on Sunday that the government was reviewing mechanisms used in Australia and other nations to impose age restrictions, citing the need to shield youths from cyberbullying, financial scams and child sexual abuse.
“We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” he told reporters, according to a video of his remarks posted online by local daily The Star.
 


The effects of social media on children’s health and safety have emerged as a global concern, with firms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Google and Meta Platforms — the operator of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — facing lawsuits in the United States over their alleged role in fuelling a mental-health crisis.
Australia is set to deactivate accounts registered to users under 16 next month, in a sweeping ban for teenagers that is being closely monitored by regulators worldwide. France, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Greece are also jointly testing a template for an age-verification app.
 
 

Neighbouring Indonesia announced in January that it planned to set a minimum age for social media users, but later opted for a less stringent regulation requiring tech platforms to filter negative content and enforce stronger age-verification measures.
Malaysia has tightened scrutiny of social media companies in recent years in response to what it says is a rise in harmful content, including online gambling and posts related to race, religion and royalty.
Platforms and messaging services with more than 8 million users in the country are now required to obtain a licence under a regulation that came into effect in January.</p><small>2025-11-24 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24112846765ac7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957047/washington-kyiv-say-peace-deal-must-fully-uphold-ukraines-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Washington, Kyiv say peace deal must ‘fully uphold’ Ukraine’s sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>Washington and Kyiv said that any eventual deal to halt the war with Russia must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty, after “constructive” talks between US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva.
After a day of meetings that kicked off based on a United States’ proposal that was criticised as being in Russia’s favour, negotiators have drafted “an updated and refined peace framework”, a US-Ukraine joint statement said on Sunday.
US President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to approve his plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which began after Russia launched a full-scale invasion.
But Kyiv was seeking changes to the draft that accepted a range of Russia’s hardline demands, with the 28-point plan requiring the invaded country to cede territory, cut its army and pledge never to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).
 
 

“The talks were constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace,” the joint statement said.
“They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,” it said, noting “meaningful progress”.
Both sides pledged to keep working on joint proposals “in the coming days”.
But even as the White House said in a separate statement that the talks marked a “significant step forward”, a Russian drone strike on the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv killed four people, its mayor said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of “tremendous” progress after a day of meetings, while the head of Ukraine’s delegation Andriy Yermak also told reporters the sides had made “very good progress”.
The Ukrainian delegation referred to a new version of the US draft plan, which has yet to be published, saying it “already reflects most of Ukraine’s key priorities”.

Rubio, whose delegation included Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, told reporters that the work to narrow the areas of disagreement had advanced “in a very substantial way”.
“I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” he said, adding: “I honestly believe we’ll get there.”
Rubio stressed that any final agreement would “have to be agreed upon by the presidents, and there are a couple [of] issues that we need to continue to work on” before trying to bring on board the Kremlin, which welcomed the original proposal.
“Obviously, the Russians get a vote.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday. Turkey has hosted three rounds of talks on ending the war.
‘Zero gratitude’ claim
His comments came after Trump earlier lashed out at Ukraine.
“Ukraine ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts,” Trump wrote in uppercase on his Truth Social platform, also accusing European countries of not doing enough to stop the war, but offering no direct condemnation of Moscow.
 






Not long after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that his country was “grateful to the United States… and personally to President Trump” for the assistance that has been “saving Ukrainian lives”.
 






Announcing a deadly Russian drone strike, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram yesterday it was “truly horrible” that despite the negotiations, “Russian troops are attacking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure, residential buildings”.
At the end of the day, Rubio said he thought Trump was “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made”.
Asked about whether he believed a deal could be reached by Thursday, he said the “deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible”.
“I think we made a tremendous amount of progress. I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”
 


European ‘centrality’
The US plan was drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies, who were scrambling on Sunday to make their voices heard and boost Kyiv’s position.
EU countries plan to discuss the Ukraine situation on the sidelines of a meeting with African leaders in Angola today.
“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, stressing that the “centrality” of the European Union’s role must be “fully reflected” in any peace plan.
 






A number of leaders called Trump on Sunday, with Downing Street saying United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the US president had agreed “that we all must work together at this critical moment to bring about a just and lasting peace”.</p><small>2025-11-24 06:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2409244246f5315.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956911/human-trafficking-surge-in-passenger-offloading-irritates-businessmen-and-tourists' target='_blank'><strong>Human trafficking: Surge in passenger offloading irritates businessmen and tourists</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: Nine passengers traveling to an African country to further proceed towards European destinations were offloaded from a flight at the Sialkot International Airport by the Immigration authorities on Sunday.
The rate of offloaded passengers from certain cities, age groups and specific destinations has seen a surge during the last couple of months. However, theheightened alertness by the immigration staff is irritating for genuine businessmen and tourists.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said that the Immigration authorities had identified a group of passengers traveling by flight number FZ316 to African country Djibouti via Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from Sialkot Airport.
 
 

Adding, he said that the passengers namely Tassawar Abbas, Muhammad Siddique, Baber Hussain, Muhammad Saleem, Akhlaq Ahmed, Muqarrabul Hassan, Muhammad Talha, Imran Sikandar and Usman Ali could not satisfy the immigration officials about the purpose of their travel.
During further investigation, they revealed that they had struck a deal with human traffickers and agents in Rs 4.2million each to send them Italy via Libyan Coast on ship as they had to reach Libya after reaching Djibouti.
The offloaded passengers belonged to Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Faisalabad and Sheikhupura districts of Punjab. The passengers were later handed over to the FIA Composite Circle, Gujranwala, for further legal action.
On the other hand a number of genuine businessmen and tourists have lodged a strong protest against the `harsh policy’ to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
President of Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters by the GtCCI.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
Some overseas Pakistanis too have lodged such complaints at the Sialkot and other airports.
President of Uk-Pak Businessmen Chamber Rashid Khan, while speaking to chamber members last week, had narrated his ordeal at the hands of Sialkot Airport staff and lodged strong protest against what he termed a discouraging attitude which should be noticed by the higher authorities.
Some other expatriate Pakistanis belonging to Gujrat region have also complained about the current policy of offloading passengers.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, Gujranwala FIA zone director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.

Panellists explore AI’s promise, perils at Adab Festival</strong></a><br><p>As artificial intelligence continues to reshape daily life, speakers at Karachi’s Adab Festival gathered at Habitt City on Sunday to discuss how the technology has evolved, what it offers, as well as the blind spots and ethical risks it now poses for the future.
The session, titled Designing Tomorrow with Artificial Intelligence, featured Dr Salman Khatani and Sadaf Bhatti, with Ahsan Siddiqui moderating. Entrepreneur Jehan Ara was scheduled to attend but was unable to do so.
Siddiqui began by noting how quickly technological trends shift, recalling earlier waves, from AutoCAD to digital marketing and e-commerce, before today’s AI boom. He pointed out that while people eagerly use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini for tasks such as grammar fixes or image edits, far fewer understand how such systems can be used to create new tools themselves. 
“Change is the only constant,” he said, while raising a broader question about the technology’s origins.
Bhatti traced AI’s emergence to 1956 and the study of neurons; historically, that year is known for John McCarthy coining the term ‘artificial intelligence’ at the first AI conference at Dartmouth College. 
According to Dr Khatani, large language models (LLMs) enable students to access advanced knowledge in local languages, a feature that, for example, allowed him to teach a seven-year-old the concept of relativity in a regional language (something previously unheard of without an LLM). 
“These tools empower the next generation to access knowledge in their native languages and transform their families’ lives,” he said. 
Citing Collins Dictionary’s designation of ‘vibe coding’ as word of the year, he said young people can now design applications and games without knowledge of machine learning or deep learning. “Now humans must return to creativity, diversity and empathy, while machines handle logic and engineering,” he said. 
Vibe coding can be understood as the practice of prompting AI tools to generate code rather than writing code manually. Despite tradeoffs, fewer barriers to entry make it easier for non-specialists to build projects with relative ease. 
Dr Khatani brought up how Nvidia recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company with just 36,000 employees and cited Cursor as an example of how AI enables small teams to achieve massive results. The discussion, however, raised questions about the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. 
As audience member Syed Khawar Mehdi put it: “Unlike the Industrial Revolution, which created jobs on a large scale, in AI’s first phase, we see a concentration of wealth. A very limited number of people are commanding huge resources and fiscal empowerment.”
He also mentioned its misuse in academia and the generation of historically inaccurate content on social media, which Dr Khatani acknowledged as genuine, along with deepfakes, intellectual property issues, and cybersecurity fraud.
Mehdi, who has authored the book ‘Honour-bound to Pakistan in Duty, Destiny and Death’, told Dawn that while he himself uses AI and sees it as extremely beneficial, it is still “a tool in evolution”. 
“We are so excited with the humongous universe that’s unfolding in front of us; we haven’t been able to see its negative side. People are using it rampantly to cheat in colleges and schools. And history is being distorted, which is very alarming,” he said, referring to AI-generated videos on social media that inaccurately depict historical figures from contradicting timelines. 
“People who define society in terms of morals and values, they have to put a foot down in front of science. [AI is] excellent in diagnostics, engineering, teaching, health, administration, water management, space technology. But when it comes to morals, values and societal norms and what defines a society, a civilisation, we as a people have to draw a line. Humans can never be replaced.”</p><small>2025-11-24 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635106-federal-constabulary-hq-comes-under-attack-in-peshawar-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three terrorists killed as suicide attack on FC HQ in Peshawar foiled: police</strong></a><br><p>

• Accuses PPP of using Section 144 to curb political gatherings
• Adil Sheikh terms amendment against judicial independence
KARACHI: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi as part of its ongoing “struggle” across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
A key meeting of TTAP was held under the chairmanship of Syed Zain Shah, the vice chairman of alliance’s Sindh chapter.
Senior leaders including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s (MWM) Allama Sadiq Jaffery, Sindh United Party’s (SUP) Munir Naich, PkMAP’s Sarbaz Abdul Rab, Bashir Khan Tareen and others attended the session.
The forum reviewed the country’s prevailing political and constitutional situation and approved several decisions.
A statement issued after the meeting said that opposition leaders resolved that the TTAP would launch a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi. Key leaders of the TTAP would address the public along the route.
 
 

“The participants of the meeting lauded the people of Sindh for observing Black Day on November 21 and appreciated the ongoing struggle of lawyers across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, TTAP vice chairman and SUP Chief Syed Zain Shah said the three-day rally would travel through multiple cities before reaching Karachi on the third day.
 
 

He said the public had grown weary of the current system, which had been marred by unemployment, economic hardship and rising inflation.
“The 27th Amendment has undermined the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” he added.
He accused the PPP of repeatedly enforcing Section 144 across Sindh to avoid facing the public’s reaction.
“After TTAP announced a public rally in Hyderabad, the sudden imposition of Section 144 throughout the province has proved that the PPP has lost its popular support in Sindh,” he said.
He added that the nationwide movement had now entered a decisive phase and attempts to “suppress public opinion or impose governments on the basis of a fabricated mandate would no longer be tolerated.”
Mr Sheikh of PTI said the 27th Cons­titutional Amendment had “stripped the judiciary of its independence” and that only a people’s struggle could dismantle the system established through a “stolen mandate”.
He said the government was introducing “anti-people” amendments while keeping PTI founder Imran Khan in “unjust imprisonment”.
“These measures will not be accepted under any circumstances,” he said.
Large public gatherings, he said, would be held in several cities during the December campaign.

In a statement, Hamas said it reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in its meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief, but accused Israel of continued violations that it said threatened to undermine the deal.
The delegation, which included exiled Hamas Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya, called for a “clear and defined mechanism” under the supervision of mediators to document and halt any breaches of the deal.
The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a local Hamas commander Alaa Al-Hadidi in Gaza, the head of supply in Hamas’ production headquarters. It said he was killed in one of the attacks across the Gaza Strip.
Hamas did not release a statement on the commander’s reported killing.
FO slams attacks
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office denounced Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza, calling Saturday’s attack that killed at least 21 people a grave breach of international law and a serious blow to ongoing peace efforts.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.” It added that the strikes had resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many others wounded.
 






“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
The statement added that these attacks also undermine international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.

US and Indian officials have signalled that the agreement is expected to be concluded by the end of November, clearing the way for their bilateral trade to reach an intended $500 billion by 2030.
“Pakistan and other South Asian nations are hoping the agreement will also encourage the United States to expand trade with the rest of the region,” one diplomatic source said. “They are looking for even-handed treatment for all.”
According to sources, these regional considerations are among the factors delaying the announcement of a joint US-Pakistan statement on bilateral trade. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan’s talks with the office of the US Trade Representative are ongoing, as both sides work to finalise various points.
Pakistani officials are keen to understand how they could benefit from provisions like reduce tariffs on goods produced with raw materials sourced from the United States, such as fabrics made from US cotton.

Pakistan closely watching implications of the impending agreement

“But now, Pakistanis are no longer pushing for an immediate announcement. Instead, they are waiting for the US-India deal to be finalised,” one source said.
When Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb last visited Washington in October to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Pakistani officials told reporters that the statement would be announced “in weeks, if not days”.
The US-Pakistan trade deal, agreed in principle in July 2025, came into effect on Aug 7. It features reciprocal tariff reductions, particularly benefiting Pakistani exports such as textiles, leather goods, surgical instruments, and agricultural products, while Pakistan rolled back its digital services tax.
Earlier, on Aug 1, Pakistan announced that the US had imposed a 19 per cent tariff on its exports — a reduction from the 29pc rate announced by President Donald Trump in April.
The revised rate was described by Islamabad as a “balanced and forward-looking step” aimed at enhancing Pakistan’s competitiveness in the American market.
In contrast, India initially faced a 26pc “reciprocal” tariff on April 9, which was later raised to 50pc by an executive order on Aug 6, effective since Aug 27, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington cautions that the 2025 reciprocal tariffs may reduce both US and global economic growth while boosting inflation in affected economies. The tariffs disproportionately penalise countries relying on global value chains, as duties are applied to gross export value, including imported inputs.
Another Washington think-tank, CSIS, notes that the “reciprocal” label is misleading: the rates are calculated via a formula based on the US trade deficit with each country, resulting in rates as high as 50pc, far exceeding simple tit-for-tat adjustments.

The first tranche of deals will include projects in Pakistan, Egypt and Europe, the organisation’s chair John Jovanovic told the Financial Times in an interview on Sunday. He added that the West was over-reliant on supplies that “are no longer fair”.
 
 

“We can’t do anything else that we’re trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning,” Jovanovic was quoted saying.
Jovanovic told FT that the bank has $100bn left to deploy of the $135bn autho­rised by Congress. He said the bank’s early deals would also include a credit insurance guarantee for $4bn of natural gas being delivered to Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners.
The Exim Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

The ongoing tug-of-war over who gets control of the Constitution Ave­nue premises is increasingly starting to resemble a joint family squeezed into an old ancestral home, where every member complains about inadequate space and competing needs.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded that the FCC be moved out of its temporary location within the IHC building, asserting that the new court must eventually operate from the FSC premises.
The bar leadership also warned that any attempt to relocate the IHC itself would be met with determined legal and democratic resistance.

Islamabad judiciary wary as newly formed Federal Constitutional Court could potentially usurp its coveted Constitution Avenue location

The establishment of the FCC has exposed what many observers describe as a lack of planning on the part of policymakers. The FCC — initially part of the 26th Constitutional Amendment package, but removed shortly before its passage — was reintroduced in the 27th Amendment.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building for the FCC days before the amendment was tabled in parliament.
However, the decision to convert the FSC building into the FCC’s permanent home was taken unilaterally, without consulting Shariat Court judges. Under the plan, four FSC judges and a backlog of only 56 pending petitions were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was instructed to urgently prepare four new courtrooms.
 
 

Simultaneously, the CDA was tasked with renovating FSC courtrooms for FCC judges. But when CDA teams arrived to take possession of the Shariat Court premises, the administration strongly resisted, even preventing their entry.
FSC Chief Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rehman, along with other judges, subsequently met Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and conveyed their reservations over what they termed a unilateral and abrupt order, requiring them to vacate their purpose-built premises within a week.
A senior lawyer remarked that the situation was ironic: “A tenant is normally granted at least a month to vacate a rented property, yet the FSC judges were expected to leave within a week from a building acquired specifically for the Shariat Court”.
Cramped space
After the 27th Amendment was passed and received presidential assent, the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC Chief Justice was held at the Presidency, attended by the top civil, military and legal leadership.
But with the FSC building still not handed over to the FCC, the oath-taking for the judges had to be held at the Islamabad High Court.
The initial oath ceremony for three judges took place on November 14 at an open space at the IHC, where IHCBA office-bearers and senior lawyers warmly greeted the newly-appointed judges.
The following day, Justice K.K. Agha was administered the oath in a cramped conference room, which could accommodate barely 25-30 people. On November 17, the oaths of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah were also conducted in the same congested room.
The IHC administration arranged seven courtrooms to enable the FCC to function temporarily until its permanent premises were finalised. But once senior staff of the FCC — many of them brought in from the Supreme Court — assumed their roles, the shortage of space became even more pronounced.
The allocation of courtrooms also caused unease. The FCC chief justice was assigned Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani for his own judicial work.
Senior officials within the high court expressed the apprehension that since the FCC is the highest constitutional forum, its chief justice could potentially assume control of the IHC building if he so desired.
Bar divided
At Friday’s press conference, IHCBA President Wajid Ali Gilani emphasised that the FCC’s use of IHC premises must remain temporary.
“The FCC must first be moved to the Supreme Court building, and permanently to the FSC, where the caseload is lower and infrastructure already exists,” he said. “No institution will be allowed to impose itself on the site of the high court.”
“Any administrative decision taken without consultation with the legal community is unacceptable and will be vigorously resisted,” he warned.
Mr Gilani recalled that Islamabad’s judicial framework had evolved from a single court functioning in Melody Market in 1960, to a full-fledged system with more than a hundred judges.
He said buildings constructed through public funds must operate according to constitutional norms rather than administrative convenience.
IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said rumours of the IHC’s relocation stemmed from a private TV report with “no legal or administrative standing”. He warned: “If anyone tries to wall off the High Court, there will be a strong protest. This community will not allow the judiciary’s independence to be compromised.” In stark contrast to the high court bar’s position, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) — commonly known as the District Bar — welcomed the proposal to shift the high court back to its old premises in Sector G-10.
After a cabinet meeting on Friday, IBA President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar said the proposal would alleviate difficulties faced by lawyers and litigants. “Shifting the high court back to G-10 is a practical and long-awaited step. It will facilitate the legal community and improve access to justice,” he said.
