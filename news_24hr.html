At just 35, Afridi has emerged as one of the most prominent young faces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s political paradigm. Representing PK-70 Bara for the first time as an MPA, Afridi’s political struggle reflects a steady rise from student activism to a cabinet position.
Born in 1989 in Khyber district’s Bara tehsil, Afridi’s roots lie deep in the tribal heartland, an area that has seen immense transformation in recent years. A graduate in economics, his early years were marked by his involvement in student politics — a platform that paved the way for his future in provincial governance.
Afridi served as the provincial president of the Insaf Students Federation (ISF), the student wing of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), where he gained recognition for mobilising youth and advocating for educational reforms. His tenure in the ISF helped him establish a grassroots political base, particularly among first-time voters and students.
Elected to the KP Assembly from PK-70 Bara in 2023, Afridi made his legislative debut with a strong mandate from his native constituency. In 2024, he was inducted into the provincial cabinet as special assistant to the chief minister on communications, a role in which he contributed to the province’s connectivity and infrastructure agenda.
Last week, in a reshuffle within the provincial cabinet, Afridi was elevated to the post of minister for higher education, a portfolio that aligns closely with his academic background and early political activism.
Irfan Saleem, PTI’s additional general secretary and the party president in Peshawar, told Dawn.com that Afridi has been a party loyalist since student life, adding that whenever Imran Khan made a call for protest, he stood in the front row.
“He saw hardship and jails for the party,“ Saleem said. “We expect that he will take Imran Khan’s cause ahead.“
“When there were drone attacks, the Bara Khyber incident or other issues, he raised his voice,” he added. “He knows the party well and will handle it to end polarisation.”
Another PTI leader in KP, Deputy Information Secretary and social media head Ikram Katahna, told Dawn.com, “We welcome this decision as we stand with Khan and his decisions.”
Katahna added that Afridi is a grassroots worker and “a common man like us and he came to this stage”.
“The PTI is a party of common people and Sohail Afridi’s nomination proves it,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-08 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627648-minister-malik-questions-legality-of-kp-cm-change' target='_blank'><strong>Minister Malik questions legality of KP CM 'change'</strong></a><br><p>

“The role of the chief minister was Imran Khan sahib’s amaanat (entrustment) and as per his order, I am returning his amaanat and submitting my resignation,” a post on Gandapur’s official Facebook account, later deleted, quoted him as saying.
 


PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also shared the same statement on X, attributed to Gandapur.
 


The PTI also confirmed the development on its official X account: “Ali Amin Gandapur has resigned as per Imran Khan’s directive.”
 


A short while before Gandapur’s statement, PTI Secretary General Raja said “this is correct” when asked by a reporter in Rawalpindi if MPA Afridi had been decided as the next chief minister.
 






Addressing a media briefing later, Raja stated that the decision was made by Imran, who he said told him about the “background of this in detail and also ordered me to put this before you”.
The PTI leader said there will be no vote of no-confidence against Gandapur as Imran had ordered him to resign. He pointed out that the PTI had a “clear majority” in the KP Assembly through which Afridi would be elected as the next chief minister.
Asked about the possibility of Gandapur refusing to resign, Raja said, “Ali Amin  is loyal to the party. Imran Khan has expressed good sentiments for him. There is no reason that Ali Amin will not follow Khan sahib’s order.”
Raja also quoted Imran as raising concerns over the spike in terrorism in PTI-ruled KP.
He said: “There is the worst terrorism situation in KP. There have been record incidents this year […] the lives lost and martyrdoms so far, there is no example found of this.”
“Khan sahib is very sad, the incident that happened in Orakzai, Khan sahib said there is no choice for him now, but to make the change [in KP CM].”
He further quoted Imran as highlighting that for over two years, he had the stance that the federal government’s policies were “very wrong” and the KP government “should disassociate itself from it”.
 


Raja stressed that Imran “repeatedly said there are three stakeholders and until they were involved, there would not be peace in KP and Pakistan”, specifying the parties as the residents of tribal areas, the Afghan government and the Afghan people.
“The way we humiliated Afghan refugees and cast them out from Pakistan, we have sown such a hate of which there was no need, after hosting them for 40 years, […] and is unforgivable in the eyes of Imran Khan,” the PTI leader said.
He also criticised the federal government for not “maintaining contact” with the Afghan interim set-up.
 
 

Raja said Imran was “sad and angry’’ that his vision was not acted on and the KP government could not “distance itself from the policies of the federal government and agencies the way it was necessary’’.
Criticising the cycle of violence involving military action and reprisals, he said there was only one way to end the menace of terrorism and that was to “sit and look at the issue in its wider context’’.
Raja said Imran had the expectation that the new KP setup under Afridi would herald ‘‘a new beginning and there will be wise talk of mutual understanding’’. He added that jirgas and tribes would be asked for help, and a solution would be provided to the province’s issues.
“Khan has affirmed the intent of adopting better policies from now on at the federal government level and the provincial government can provide guidance on this matter. It is the expectation of Imran Khan that Sohail Afridi will guide and advise the federal government and make it understand how to establish peace in the region and act on Imran Khan’s vision.”
“There was a perception created that our provincial government was a helper of the federal government’s misplaced policies, so the expectation from Sohail Afridi is he will distance himself and clearly say we don’t support the federal government’s policies,’’ Raja added.
‘Not a result of rift with Aleema’
However, Raja refuted speculation that the decision was a result of the recent dispute between Gandapur and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.
“Imran Khan also expressed good intentions for Ali Amin. He thinks it will also be good for Ali Amin to leave the office and become part of politics that is politics of the people of KP,” he said.
Today’s development comes about a week after the PTI found itself embroiled in another controversy after Aleema and Gandapur exchanged grave allegations, with the latter accusing Imran’s sister of provoking rifts in the party.
The argument started with Aleema claiming that Gandapur had told her imprisoned brother that she was trying to hijack the PTI with the help of the Military Intelligence (MI) and the “establishment”. She made these remarks only a day after Gandapur met the ex-premier in jail for more than two hours and left the premises without speaking to the media persons.
In a video statement in response to Aleema’s allegations, Gandapur claimed that campaigns were being carried out to declare her the PTI chairperson. He acknowledged telling Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas.
The claims made by Aleema — who came to the limelight after her brother was jailed in August 2023 and regularly meets him at Adiala jail — and Gandapur strengthened speculations about a severe rift between the PTI and Imran’s family members.
In June, the midnight passage of the KP fiscal budget also exposed deep divisions within the PTI.
Gandapur initially said his government would follow Imran’s directives on the budget and meet with him to secure the approval. However, days later on June 24, the provincial assembly bulldozed cut motions on demands for grants and greenlit the budget without Gandapur being able to meet the PTI founder.
The passage was met with surprise from key PTI leaders, including Raja and ex-KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who said the approval could have been extended till June 27 at least.
Gandapur justified the approval, saying that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
Gohar says Imran’s orders to be acted on
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said, while talking to the media in Islamabad, that once Imran’s instructions were delivered, no other party body could contradict them but had to act on them.
“Khan’s instructions will be acted on. Ali Amin Gandapur will depart for Peshawar in half an hour and send his resignation via summary to the governor tomorrow. Everyone will support the PTI government that will be formed as per Khan’s instructions.’’
He said he wanted to make it “clear’’ that there was ‘‘no forward bloc’’ in the party. Gohar said the party would maintain its two-third majority in KP with 91 MPAs.
Gohar added that Gandapur had clearly said that he was the chief minister only as long as Imran’s trust was reposed in him. He also praised him for his performance in the top provincial office, saying he had worked day and night for the party, government and people.</p><small>2025-10-08 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08124906c6bec4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947421/sc-constitutional-bench-mulls-formation-of-full-court-while-hearing-pleas-against-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench mulls formation of full court while hearing pleas against 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment.
The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
 
 

The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months, and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request.
The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB.
During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment.
Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings.
 


Commenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners, said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”.
 






The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night.
Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year.
As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February.
 
 

“This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution.
In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.”
Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.”
Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that.
Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”.
Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased.
 
 

“After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said.
Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court.
Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP.
Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added.
“On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order.
“Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so.
 
 

Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”.
“Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered.
Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition.
Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative.
 
 

At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore.
“A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised.
At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked.
However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”.
The petitions
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.
 
 

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-08 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081944572296d24.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947474/trio-win-nobel-chemistry-prize-for-work-on-hermiones-handbag-materials' target='_blank'><strong>Trio win Nobel chemistry prize for work on ‘Hermione’s handbag’ materials</strong></a><br><p>Scientists Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi won the 2025 Nobel chemistry prize for developing a new form of molecular architecture, yielding materials that can help tackle challenges such as climate change and lack of fresh water.
The three laureates worked to create molecular constructions, known as metal-organic frameworks or MOFs, with large spaces through which gases and other chemicals can flow and that can be utilised to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide or store toxic gases.
 






Describing the “unheard of properties” of these materials, the award committee said some had a remarkably large surface area — a porous material roughly the size of a small sugar cube could contain as much surface area as a large football pitch.
“A small amount of such material can be almost like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter. It can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume,” Olof Ramstrom, member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said.
Uses could include dealing with ‘forever chemicals’
The more than a century-old prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the winners share 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million), as well as the fame of winning arguably the world’s most prestigious science award.
Kitagawa told the Nobel press conference that he was deeply honoured by the award.
“My dream is to capture air and separate air to — for instance, in CO2 or oxygen or water or something — and convert this to useful materials using renewable energy,” he said.
After the discoveries, chemists have built tens of thousands of different MOFs, some of which “may contribute to solving some of humankind’s greatest challenges”, the Academy said, adding that additional uses included separating toxic PFAS, or “forever chemicals”, from water and breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment.
Kitagawa is a professor at Kyoto University in Japan, while Robson is a professor at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and Yaghi is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.
Kitagawa is Japanese, Robson was born in Britain but moved to Australia in his late 20s, while Yaghi is Jordanian-American.
‘Science is the greatest equalising force in the world’
Yaghi was born to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, where his family shared a one-room home with the cattle the family was raising.
“It’s quite a journey and science allows you to do it,” he said in an interview published on the Nobel website, adding that his parents could barely read or write.
“Science is the greatest equalising force in the world,” he said.
Yaghi, who said he was astonished and delighted to win the award, was 10 years old when he found a book on molecules in the library, and it was the beginning of a life-long love of chemistry.
“The deeper you dig, the more beautifully you find things are constructed,” he told the Nobel website.
Robson said he got the call from Stockholm half an hour before the official announcement and that he celebrated quietly at his home outside Melbourne.</p><small>2025-10-08 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08194231c70e9c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947465/man-arrested-in-kps-shangla-district-for-allegedly-raping-teenage-daughter-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested in KP’s Shangla district for allegedly raping teenage daughter: police</strong></a><br><p>A man was arrested on Wednesday on charges of allegedly sexually assaulting his teenage daughter in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bisham area of Shangla district, officials said.
“The victim reached the police station on Wednesday,” Bisham Station House Officer (SHO) Afzal Khan told Dawn.com. “A first information report (FIR) was lodged, and the suspect has been arrested.”
According to the FIR, the victim’s mother was divorced by her husband, who later married another woman from Swat. However, nine years ago, the stepmother also left and returned to her parents’ home.
“I live with two of my stepbrothers, one of whom is paralysed, and my father in a rented house,” she said, per the FIR.
The victim reported that she was at home and her brother had gone to Rawalpindi for work when her father called her to his room, where he showed her a knife and sexually assaulted her.
She alleged that her father also threatened her with murder if she told anyone about the ordeal.
The victim added that she went to the police station when she got the chance to lodge an FIR against her father and to get protection from him.
Police registered the FIR under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code and started further investigation into the case.
A senior doctor at the tehsil headquarters hospital, Bisham, who wished not to disclose his name, examined the victim and confirmed that she was raped.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA -Pakistan), citing the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017–18, said 28 per cent of women aged 15–49 have reported experiencing physical violence and 6pc have endured sexual violence, while 34pc of ever-married women have faced spousal physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.
It said that among them, 5pc reported experiencing spousal sexual violence. Alarmingly, 56pc of women who have endured physical or sexual violence have not sought help or confided in anyone about their experiences, largely due to socio-cultural barriers, economic dependency, lack of information and accessibility, and the absence of adequate support systems such as healthcare and psycho-social services.
Earlier this month, the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency arrested three people suspected of gang-raping and blackmailing a minor in KP’s Abbottabad, according to a police official.
In July, the KP police said they arrested a suspect after a 13-year-old maid was allegedly raped and murdered in Abbottabad.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08172853bdcc7dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947466/sindh-inspector-general-vows-to-protect-traders-amid-rising-incidents-of-extortion-in-province' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh inspector general vows to protect traders amid rising incidents of extortion in province</strong></a><br><p>In the wake of concerns expressed by the business community over increasing extortionism, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday vowed to provide full protection to economic and commercial activities in collaboration with traders across the province.
“Elements hindering economic activity would be eliminated with the cooperation of the businessmen,” the provincial police chief was quoted as saying in a police statement while reviewing a crime data report on Karachi, which was submitted by Additional IG Operations.
As per the police statement, 118 incidents of extortion were reported in Karachi so far this year, of which only 44 were genuine extortion cases, while the remaining 74 pertained to personal disputes and business quarrels. The statement added that of the 44 cases, 39 were “solved” — a success ratio of 87 per cent.
A police crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com linked 12 of the 44 cases to three specific groups: the Wasiullah Lakho group, the Samad Kathiawari group and the Jamil Changa group.
“These gang leaders are reportedly settled in Iran and use Iranian numbers to carry out their operations,” the report read. “Paperwork for [the] issuance of red notices has been completed, and all queries have been removed.”
Police spokesperson Syed Saad Ali was quoted as saying that a total of 78 suspects involved in these cases were identified, of which 43 were arrested and five others were gunned down in “encounters”.
The statement added that the Sindh IG met with the trading community around 10 days ago and since then, four extortionists were gunned down in police “encounters”.
“Law and order and business atmosphere are being further strengthened in Sindh province with [the] cooperation of traders,” the provincial police chief was quoted as saying.
IG Memon appreciated the business community’s decision to install CCTV cameras at their business centres and added that the Sindh government, police and other law enforcement agencies are standing with traders to promote economic activities.
“By utilising resources provided by the Sindh government, the police are carrying out effective action against the criminal elements on a daily basis,” said the Sindh IG.
The police’s latest crime data shows that, compared to last year, there has been a “significant” reduction in street crimes during the ongoing year. As of 2024, 252 incidents of street crimes were being reported daily, but this year, only 167 incidents have been reported, a decrease of 52pc.
According to a crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com, only six people were killed as of September 2025, compared to 13 as of January 2024.
Additionally, crimes like mobile snatchings went down from 2,305 as of January 2024 to 1,438 as of September 2025, while motorcycle snatchings fell from 865 to 472. The theft of motorcycles and cars also decreased, from 163 and 4,472 to 160 and 2,915, respectively.
“Overall, street crime has fallen by 36pc [while the] average per day street crime is down by 34pc,” the crime report read.
During the same period, there were 53 cases of robberies with murder and 189 robberies with injury. When looking at cases solved, the numbers were 37 and 122, respectively.
However, car snatching increased, with 25 incidents reported as of September 2025 from 17 in January 2024.
Similarly, 34 cases of kidnappings have been reported this year so far, involving 37 abductees. Two of them have been recovered safely by the police, while “concerted efforts are underway to recover [the] two remaining persons. Both kidnapping cases were ‘honey traps’,” the police’s statement read.
According to police, 46 kidnappers were arrested in 34 cases, while two others were gunned down in encounters.
In May, a senior police officer on Monday said that a total of 33 persons were shot dead in incidents of street crime, citing data collected by the police.
Special Investigation Unit Chief Senior Superintendent of Police Mohammed Shoaib Memon said that of them, 23 cases were reported through the arrest of culprits involved in heinous crimes, while 10 cases were under investigation.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081554159c9a4e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947455/ecp-decides-to-hold-local-govt-polls-in-punjab-in-last-week-of-december' target='_blank'><strong>ECP decides to hold local govt polls in Punjab in last week of December</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decided on Wednesday to hold Punjab’s long-delayed local government (LG) elections in December’s last week and that the process of delimitation would initiate from tomorrow to be completed within two months.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions. In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was issued by a four-member ECP bench comprising Chairman Sikandar Sultan Raja, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Shah Muhammad Jatoi and Babar Hassan Bharwana.
It stated that the election regulator had “decided to hold the local government elections in the province of Punjab on the basis of the existing local government law, i.e. the Punjab Local Government Act 2022 and Rules framed thereunder”.
The bench ordered the ECP office to initiate the process of delimitation from tomorrow (October 9) and complete it within two months.
“Thereafter, the election programme should be announced and the election should be held in the last week of December 2025. The office is expected to follow the timelines strictly,” the order said.
It referred to another one released after a June hearing held by the ECP on the matter, which stated that the ECP had accepted the Punjab government’s request for three months’ time for the completion of various activities pertaining to the election “in the interest of justice”.
“In case of failure, the commission will issue appropriate orders regarding the conduct of local government elections in the province of Punjab,” the June order had said.
Referring to it, today’s order stated that having received no response from the Punjab government after a period of three months, the ECP again fixed the matter for a hearing today and issued a notice to the local government secretary.
It said it the local government secretary appeared in person and said that the process of legislation for the Punjab Local Government Act was under the process of completion after being delayed by the floods. He added that the standing committee had finalised the process and the bill would be laid down in the Punjab Assembly for passage, requesting that some time be granted till the assembly session was convened.
The ECP said it had “exhausted all possible efforts’’ for the conducting of the Punjab local government elections in Punjab, but the provincial administration “acted in a dilatory manner to delay the conduct” of polls each time on one or the other pretext.
The bench added that it was the ECP’s constitutional obligation to organise and conduct elections in accordance with the Constitution and law, which entrusted it with “exclusive, broad and extensive powers to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities’’.
At the same time, it pointed out that it was also the constitutional responsibility of the provincial governments to ensure the establishment of a local government system in accordance with the Constitution and the law.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08153518eda338a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947452/ppp-pml-n-should-resolve-issues-move-forward-rana-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PML-N should resolve issues, move forward: Rana Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has urged federal coalition partners, the PML-N and PPP, to resolve their political differences and “move forward” from the row between the Sindh and Punjab governments.
 
 

The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
A day earlier, PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman warned the coalition ally of difficulties in the Senate without her party’s “clear support”.
Addressing the matter in an interview on Samaa TV show ‘Nadeem Malik Live’ a day ago, Sanaullah said: “The current political leadership … should sit down at the table and resolve their political issues, and by resolving them, they should create the path forward”.
He said that ’’there will be no interference from that side,“ apparently referring to the establishment, adding that the quarter would instead “provide help” if politicians resolved their issues.
Concerted efforts have been made by leading figures, such as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari, who have stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement.
It is believed that Naqvi could ask the relevant quarters to intervene and get the warring sides to stand down, an insider had told Dawn.
Questioned whether the matter actually concerned recent speculation about Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president, Sanaullah said the issue had already been rubbished by “the relevant quarters”. He added that the army chief “has no personal agenda and this talk is completely wrong that he has any [other] intention or agenda”.
The senator added that the army chief would “go home” upon retirement and “he has absolutely no intention of coming to the Prime Minister’s House or President House”.
The army chief has also personally dismissed speculation about changes in the presidency and premiership as the work of elements conspiring against the ruling setup.
Speculation was rampant in July that President Zardari may step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency.
Reports on social media had claimed that work was underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports had also claimed that President Zardari had set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.
The rumours were summarily addressed and rubbished by Naqvi twice and by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry as “nonsense”.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08191352c20af1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947471/mooney-century-lifts-australia-to-221-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Mooney century lifts Australia to 221 against Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>A composed century from Beth Mooney rescued Australia from a precarious position as they reached 221 for nine in their ICC Women’s World Cup match against Pakistan at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.
Opting to bowl first, Pakistan’s bowlers struck early through Diana Baig (3-74) and Nashra Sandhu (3-37), leaving the defending champions reeling at 61 for five. The top order once again struggled for rhythm, with Alyssa Healy (20), Phoebe Litchfield (10) and Ellyse Perry (5) all dismissed inside the first 15 overs.
At 76 for seven, Australia were in serious trouble before Mooney led a remarkable recovery. The left-hander paced her innings with precision, crafting a brilliant 109 off 114 balls with 11 boundaries. Her calm approach in the face of Pakistan’s disciplined bowling steadied the innings when collapse loomed.
 






Alana King played a major hand in the turnaround, striking 51 off 49 deliveries — the highest score ever made by a batter at No. 10 or lower in women’s ODIs. Together, Mooney and King added crucial lower-order runs that pulled Australia from the brink and gave their total some substance.
Kim Garth also played a steadying role, helping rebuild after the early collapse before Pakistan’s spinners tightened their grip again. For much of the first 30 overs, Pakistan were outstanding with the ball, maintaining tight lines and sharp fielding support, while wicketkeeper Sidra Nawaz impressed with a sharp display behind the stumps.
Among the other bowlers, Fatima Sana (2-49) and Rameen Shamim (2-32) maintained control during the middle overs, ensuring that Australia never ran away with the scoring.
Pakistan, still searching for their first win of the tournament after defeats to Bangladesh and India, will need a composed batting effort to chase down 222 and keep their campaign alive.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627614-who-is-sohail-afridi-tipped-to-be-next-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Sohail Afridi — the next KP CM?</strong></a><br><p>

Religious chatbots and other faith-based digital tools are growing in number, offering counsel, comfort and spiritual guidance during an age of rapidly transforming socialisation and engagement.
One app, which is called Text with Jesus, has thousands of paying subscribers. It lets people ostensibly ask questions of Mary, Joseph, Jesus and nearly all 12 apostles.
The idea is to educate, said Stephane Peter, CEO of Catloaf Software, which created the app.
“This is a new way to address religious issues in an interactive way,” he told AFP.
Although the app makes clear it uses AI, virtual Moses and Jesus don’t recognise that as such when asked the specific question.
Peter said that ChatGPT’s latest version, GPT-5, on which Text With Jesus is based, follows instructions better than previous iterations. It is also better at staying in whatever character it is supposed to be and can deny more forcefully that it’s a bot.
He said many people consider the app blasphemous, but it has still received a good rating in the App Store — 4.7 out of 5.
Online ministry Catholic Answers said it got a taste of how sensitive all this can be when it launched the animated AI character “Father Justin” last year.
“A lot of people were offended that it was using a priest character,” said Christopher Costello, the ministry’s director of information technology.
Days later, Catholic Answers stripped the avatar of its title to make it simply Justin. “We don’t want to replace humans. We just want to help,” Costello said.
No ‘heart and spirit’
Other major religions have similar apps, such as Deen Buddy for Islam, Vedas AI for Hinduism, and AI Buddha. Most bill themselves as interfaces with scripture, not incarnations of actual holiness.
 
 

Nica, a 28-year-old Filipina who belongs to the Anglican Church, said she uses ChatGPT almost daily to study scripture — even though her pastor wants her to stop.
“I’d say it’s an added layer,” said Nica, who declined to give her last name.
“I am in a Christian community, and my husband and I have spiritual mentors.
It’s just that sometimes I have random thoughts about the Bible and I want answers immediately.”
Not many will acknowledge using AI assistants in matters of religion, even though some of these apps have been downloaded millions of times.
“People who want to believe in God, maybe shouldn’t ask a chatbot. They should talk to people that believe, too,” said a woman named Emanuela as she left St Patrick’s Cathedral in New York.
 
 

Rabbi Gilah Langner said the halakhah — the collective body of religious laws derived from the Torah, the Jewish holy book — has many interpretations.
Jews need other Jews, with their insights and perspective, to connect them to the tradition of their faith, she said.
“I don’t think you really get that from AI. It’s possible it would be very nuanced, but the emotional connection is missing,” Langner told AFP.
AI can make people feel “isolated and not in an organic connection to a living tradition,” she added.
For their part, Christian communities do not reject AI outright.
Peter said he had spoken to clergy members, and they agreed that AI could be a tool to educate people.
Last year, Pope Francis named Demis Hassabis, a co-founder of AI research lab Google DeepMind, to serve in the Vatican’s scientific academy.
And as much of society experiments with artificial intelligence, so does the clergy.
 
 

In November 2023, pastor Jay Cooper of the Violet Crown City Church in Austin, Texas, had an AI assistant deliver an entire sermon. He warned parishioners in advance.
“Some people freaked out, said we are now an AI church,” said Cooper. But, he added, the service lured some people who did not usually attend church, especially video-game buffs.
Cooper said he has considered other ways of integrating AI into his church, but has not repeated the AI sermon.
“I’m glad we did it,” he said, “but it missed the heart and spirit of what we usually do.“</p><small>2025-10-08 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627607-journalist-tufail-rind-shot-dead-in-ghotki-while-taking-children-to-school' target='_blank'><strong>Journalist Tufail Rind shot dead in Ghotki while taking children to school</strong></a><br><p>

The statement from the army brass, released after the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) held at General Headquarters (GHQ), comes in the wake of last week’s provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership.
Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. He had said that Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The Pakistan military had issued a strong response to the remarks and wanred that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. It had said that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
A statement from the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said that the military brass also took notice of the remarks in today’s CCC.
“The forum pledged to counter any Indian aggression with a swift and decisive response, shattering any perceived notion of India’s relative safety accruing from geography. Any imaginary new normal will be met with a new normal of swift retributive response,” the ISPR said.
 






It added that the military leadership expressed grave concerns about the recent “irresponsible and unwarranted provocative statements” by the Indian civil and military leadership.
“Such rhetoric conforms to the well-known Indian propensity of whipping up war hysteria for political benefits. The participants agreed that unwarranted warmongering is likely to lead to heightened tensions and will endanger regional peace and security,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing said the meeting commenced with prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks “orchestrated by Indian terror proxies”.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “commended the spirit, resolve and determination of the Pakistan armed forces in war against foreign-sponsored terror proxies and during extensive relief and rescue operations in the aftermath of recent floods, in conjunction with civil administration and other law enforcement agencies”, the statement said.
It further added that the forum undertook a “comprehensive review’’ of ongoing counter-terrorism operations, emerging threat paradigms and operational readiness and reaffirmed that the military remained ready to “thwart inimical designs of Pakistan’s adversaries across all domains”.
The ISPR also said that the CCC members affirmed that the “existing nexus between terror and crime with vested political patronage, which is gravely hurting the interests of the state and security of its people, will not be allowed to continue anymore, come what may”.
The military’s media wing further said that the participants expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The participants also acknowledged the significance of Pakistan’s recent high-level diplomatic engagements and reaffirmed their commitment to global and regional peace. In particular, the military welcomed the landmark mutual defence deal between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and said it underscored “shared values, mutual respect, and a joint vision” for peace and security in the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh in September.
“The forum reiterated Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The forum also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and hoped for early ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The forum reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on Palestine issue, voicing support for the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“In his closing remarks, the COAS, directed the commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, physical fitness, innovation and responsiveness. The COAS expressed full confidence in the operational preparedness of Pakistan Army to counter threats across the entire spectrum, from conventional and sub-conventional, to hybrid and asymmetric threats,” the military’s media wing concluded.</p><small>2025-10-08 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08191405aee8e80.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947414/why-are-ppp-and-pml-n-currently-feuding' target='_blank'><strong>Why are PPP and PML-N currently feuding?</strong></a><br><p>What started as a difference in opinion over how to aid flood-affected people has now spiralled into a full-blown feud between the PML-N and the PPP, the two main partners in the ruling coalition.
The spat, termed a ghar ka mamla by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Sept 30, has devolved into a public spectacle threatening the alliance between the two parties.
The bad blood has escalated to the point that leaders from both sides hold daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side. And now, President Asif Ali Zardari appears to be making overtures to smooth over the situation.
But how did the whole thing begin? Here’s what we know.
How to help flood victims?
It appears that differences developed between the PML-N and the PPP last month as the two bickered on how to help flood victims. Several PPP leaders, including Sherry Rehman, called for the utilisation of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to aid flood victims in Punjab, while the provincial government insisted it would use its own resources to do so.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
During this time, PML-N lea­der Rana Sanaullah also called for a complete overhaul of the BISP. He also stated that the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.
In response to Sanaullah’s comments, PPP leader Humayun Khan criticised the PML-N’s approach, stressing that “this is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action.“
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari then took a jibe at the PPP-led Sindh government over its insistence on the BISP, refusing to take advice from “those who turned Sindh into archaeological ruins”.
 






At one point, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the first lady and an MNA, also joined the discourse and said that the BISP was the “most effective way” to distribute aid to flood-affected people, adding that it would be “irresponsible to not utilise it”.
 






On September 25, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the floods in the country, while PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz — who is also the Punjab chief minister — accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
“The PPP is our ally and I respect them, but unfortunately, they have been politicising the floods in Punjab,” the Punjab CM said.
“I don’t know their agenda, but I want to tell [President] Asif Zardari and [PPP Chairman] Bilawal … please help your party’s spokesperson understand that if, Gob forbid, there is a disaster in Sindh, Punjab would stand with it.”
CM Punjab went on to question the efficiency of BISP, calling it a “very simplistic solution” to an otherwise complicated problem. “What will people who have lost their homes, cattle, and crops do with just Rs10,000?”
‘My water, my money’
However, tensions finally boiled over when, on September 29, Maryam resurrected the issue of the Cholistan canals project. The Cholistan water project has been a bone of contention between the Sindh and Punjab governments ever since the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) gave its nod on Jan 17, 2024 on the issuance of a water availability certificate for the controversial project.
Cholistan canal — also known as Cholistan Flood Feeder in papers — aims to develop a new command area, though in a phased manner, in southern Punjab, depending on flows from the Sutlej River, besides flood supplies. Sutlej flows, according to Sindh’s position, depend on surplus releases from India ever since it was surrendered to India under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.
In April, the government had announced that it was halting the contentious canals project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
In her fiery speech, Maryam had said, “If Punjab wants to construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab.
“If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued.
She said that India had also done something similar, adding, “So why can’t I? It is my water, my money, everything is mine.”
Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she also rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab.
“Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.
PPP takes offence, walks out of Parliament
The next day, PPP’s Naveed Qamar stood up in the National Assembly to record his party’s protest against Maryam’s speech and summarily walked out of the lower house of Parliament. The PPP also stayed away from the Senate session held the same day.
In his speech, PPP’s Qamar termed Maryam’s usage of words “regrettable”.
“She [Maryam] says it is our water and we will make a canal. What does it mean?” asked Qamar, adding that “the River Indus water is for all the people” living in the country.
“If you do not want to act on our advice, then it’s okay, but we (PPP) are being taunted for providing support to this government, which we are doing in the national interest,” he said.
“It is becoming difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said amid sloganeering by some of the opposition PTI members. “The way things are moving, we will soon be there [opposition benches],” Qamar said while addressing the PTI lawmakers.
 






Subsequently, Law Minister Tarar, in a bid to diffuse the tension, offered an “apology” for Maryam’s remarks. He insisted that differences between the PML-N and the PPP were internal matters and expressed the hope that their alliance would remain intact.
This led to a meeting between PPP and PML-N bigwigs in Islamabad on Oct 1, where the former asked Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
Maryam doubles down
Unfazed by apparent cracks in the ruling alliance, Maryam — who at this point was appearing on television screens daily — asserted on October 3 that she would “never apologise” for her remarks.
“I am not going to leave my people alone,” Maryam said. “If you talk, I’ll respond befittingly […] Think 100 times over before talking negatively about Punjab.”
During this time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also allegedly discussed the situation between the two parties with his elder brother and Maryam’s father, Nawaz Sharif, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers.
 


“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government, bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar stated in the National Assembly that differences between the PPP and the PML-N would be resolved within a few days, while also adding that verbal attacks from both sides should stop.
PPP walks out of Parliament again as president gets involved
Parliamentary proceedings were once again affected on October 6 as both houses of Parliament were adjo­urned without any agenda items being taken up following walkouts by PPP lawmakers.
During the Senate session, PPP’s Sherry Rehman, without naming the Punjab chief minister, expressed her concerns over the “divisive rhetoric emerging from Punjab towards Sindh”.
“The ongoing war of words between Punjab and Sindh is obviously affecting the unity and the coalition,” she said. However, she said, it became difficult “when someone crosses the red line and plays the Punjab card”. “A coalition cannot be run by insulting others,” she said.
The same day, President Asif Ali Zardari called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting regarding the escalating row.
“President Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the presidency said on X.
PPP escalates, Maryam deflects
On Tuesday, it appeared that the involvement of others had borne fruit as there appeared to be a slight shift in tone from both sides.
While the PPP stepped up its criticism of the Punjab government, Maryam avoided direct broadsides against the PPP, instead shifting her focus to their common foe, the PTI.
PPP’s Sherry Rehman warned the coalition ally of difficulties in the Senate without the former’s “clear support”.
“If you don’t need [us] then that’s your choice, but let me remind you we are the biggest party in the Senate and it will become very difficult for you without the PPP’s clear support,“ she said.
On the other hand, Maryam was more guarded in her remarks. However, she did allude to the ongoing rift, saying: “I am also cleaning the minds of those who are jealous of Punjab’s development. I am the chief minister of this province. If I don’t speak for Punjab, who will?”
Friends again?
As of now, reconciliation does not appear to be on the horizon, even though efforts may be underway to secure a truce. An insider has told Dawn that Interior Minister Naqvi could ask the relevant quarters to intervene and get the warring sides to stand down.
According to him, the PPP’s grouse in Punjab is not limited to the flood issue. “The flood and canal issues have increased the already existing distrust between the two parties on this matter,” the source said.

A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij.
Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said.
It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men.
The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid.
The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”.
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office.
“The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said.
“We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country.
A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”.
It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khawarij. The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read.
It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage.
The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.”
He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”.
“The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying.
A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes.
The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them.
“Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported.
“The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Two reports, issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.</p><small>2025-10-08 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08142107070f0e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947441/ghotki-journalist-tufail-rind-shot-dead-by-unknown-assailants-in-presence-of-his-children-police' target='_blank'><strong>Ghotki journalist Tufail Rind shot dead by unknown assailants in presence of his children: police</strong></a><br><p>A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police.
The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car.
“Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said.
Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities.
The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”.
“The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added.
The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack.
According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News, and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken.
SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time.
“We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.”
A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures.
Suspects arrested
Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder.
“The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran.
He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute.
“All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added.
Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.”
Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured.
Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders.
Condemnations pour in
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“
Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”.
In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time.
Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable.
“Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement.
Journalist, press associations demand justice
Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office.
 
 

The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.”
They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed.
PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”.
He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.”
Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”.
“The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said.
Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”.
“Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder, another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.”
Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police.
 






Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.
In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel.
Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024. He succumbed to fatal injuries at a Karachi hospital three days later.</p><small>2025-10-08 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08122638140069a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947427/no-casualties-reported-as-fire-doused-at-factory-in-karachis-liaquatabad-rescue-service' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as fire doused at factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad: rescue service</strong></a><br><p>No casualties were reported after a fire erupted in a plastic factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad area early on Wednesday and was extinguished after hectic efforts, according to a rescue official.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com, “The fire erupted in the plastic factory located in a market near Sindhi Hotel in Liaquatabad at around 7:30am.”
He said three fire tenders managed to control it, and no casualties were reported.
Liaquatabad Station House Officer Ghulam Yasin told Dawn.com that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
 
 

According to city planners and engineers, 70 per cent of residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Karachi lacked an adequate fire safety system. Citing official data of the city’s fire department, Fire Protection Association President Kunwar Waseem said the city witnessed nearly 3,000 such incidents in 2024.
On September 9, four firefighters and one cameraman of a private TV channel were injured when a huge fire destroyed a three-storey garment factory in New Karachi Industrial Area and also damaged two other adjacent factories.
Later that month, two women died and nine other people were rescued in a fire that erupted in a four-storey building in the city’s Defence Housing Authority.
In August, at least six people died in a fire inside a warehouse near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex, while eight were injured in another blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi earlier that month.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081156079114420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947430/rawalpindi-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-aleema-khan-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in connection with the party’s November 26 case, dismissing an exemption plea filed by her to appear for a hearing.
More than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the city on Nov 26 last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them.
Aleema was to be indicted in the November 26 protest case registered at Sadiqabad Police Station during today’s hearing, but she did not appear before the court.
During the hearing, the prosecutor objected that the person applying on Aleema’s behalf was not her lawyer, and therefore was not authorised to file an application without a power of attorney.
On this basis, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah dismissed Aleema’s application for exemption and issued bailable arrest warrants for her.
The other 10 suspects in the case appeared in court, while the hearing was adjourned until October 11 (Saturday).
Early in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
In October last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144,  a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081421218877a09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947448/mohsin-naqvi-says-afghanistans-visa-issues-for-asian-cup-qualifier-resolved' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi says Afghanistan’s visa issues for Asian Cup qualifier resolved</strong></a><br><p>Visa issues surrounding Afghanistan’s football team being able to play in Pakistan have been sorted out, allowing the team to travel to Islamabad for Thursday’s AFC Asian Cup qualifier at the Jinnah Stadium, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Pakistan Football Federation president Mohsen Gilani said that its Afghanistan counterpart had failed to ensure the presence of its full travelling squad at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul for biometric verification, as most of the players were not living in the country.
The Afghanistan Football Federation was quoted by the Afghan Voice Agency as stating that it had sent the initial list of team members to the Pakistan Embassy on September 18, but “despite repeated follow-ups and official contacts, visas have not been issued to the players and officials”.
Today, Minister Naqvi took to X to announce the issue had been sorted out.
“Issued now,” he said in response to journalist Faizan Lakhani’s post saying the minister has ordered to sort out the visa issue of the Afghanistan football team.
“Thank you for highlighting it,” Naqvi added.
 






Uncertainty surrounded the qualifier due to the latter failing to secure visas for its players earlier.
Reports from Afghanistan said that all of its national team players had gathered in Dubai on Tuesday evening, and they were awaiting visa clearance.
Both Pakistan and Afghanistan are pointless after losing their opening two matches in Group ‘E’ against Syria and Myanmar.  The two sides have a double-header in this international window, with Afghanistan to host Pakistan in Al Ardiya, Kuwait, for the return game on October 14.

There is mounting evidence that the air quality in Pakistan is having a strong impact on our quality of life. While research has shown the impact of poor air quality on morbidity and mortality for more serious conditions, its insidious effects are not discussed enough.
The numbers paint a frightening picture.
According to the World Air Quality report, Pakistan was the second most polluted country in 2018. At the time of writing this article, Karachi and Lahore were among the 10 cities in the world to have the most polluted air, with Lahore’s AQI (Air Quality Index) at 188 and Karachi’s at 182.
An AQI of up to 50 is healthy. Beyond that, an AQI 0f 100-150 becomes unhealthy for children, and people with heart and lung disease. An AQI of above 150 is unhealthy for everyone while levels above 300 constitute a health emergency.
Data from Lahore and Peshawar showed an AQI of above 300 on multiple days in the month of November. As for Lahore alone, in November, there wasn’t a single day in the country’s cultural capital that could be called healthy.
 


Pakistan’s air pollution levels have transformed into a more dire health emergency than smoking, tuberculosis, and unsafe water and sanitation, reducing our life expectancy more than any of the three listed causes.
In this situation, children are especially vulnerable, and air pollution causes 1 in 10 deaths for children under the age of five. Air pollution worsens respiratory problems for children as well as adults, causes childhood cancer, and impacts healthy brain development. For pregnant women, being exposed to air pollution can lead to premature births.
 


In this article, we as a group of public health experts will attempt to comment on the various insidious effects that air pollution has on the public at large.
How respiratory health is impacted
Air pollutants come in all shapes and sizes (literally, ranging from coarse to ultra-fine) depending on the source of the pollutant. Studies show that air pollutants contain chemical substances that cause direct damage to the lungs’ inner lining and prevent DNA repair of an already damaged inner lining. This imbalance in damage and repair can promote abnormal cell growth, leading to lung cancer.
Moreover, research shows that the presence of air pollutants in our airways paralyses the cilia (small hair-like structure on our wind-pipes that clear any bacteria or foreign particles), causing an increase in bacterial growth, thus promoting infections like pneumonia.
Unfortunately, the very medium of this pollution has exposed us to it every day, involuntarily allowing them to enter our bodies through every breath we take. The very nature of this exposure primarily affects our lungs, the gateway to air inside our body, leading to asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease and of course lung cancer.

Recent estimations by the World Health Organisation show that air pollution was responsible for almost 10 million deaths in 2018. Overall, up to 35% of total deaths occur due to lung related diseases, caused directly or indirectly by air pollution, making it the world’s largest health risk.
In Pakistan, there are many more sources of air pollution other than motorised vehicles and industries. A vast majority of the population in Pakistan depends on solid fuel burning for basic needs like cooking, heating and light which further increases the risk of air pollution exposure within homes, and especially to children. Such exposure can reduce a person’s ability to combat diseases, especially lung-related infections like tuberculosis.
Effects on cardiovascular health
Population scientists over the years have examined outcomes of people exposed to high levels of air pollutants and have found strong independent association of exposure to ambient air pollutants with development and progression of cardiovascular disease and risk factors. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and aortic dissections. Leading medical journals like the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and Circulation have published papers linking exposure to particulate matter with higher risk of development of heart disease, premature death and poorer quality of life after a heart attack.
In the context of Pakistan, it is critical to realise the magnitude of the difference in air quality between countries where these studies were done and air quality in Pakistan.
The air pollutant that is associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes is termed Particulate Matter 2.5 or PM2.5 because of its size (< 2.5 µm). Unlike the larger air pollutants, PM2.5 makes its way all the way down to the lungs and gets absorbed in the blood. Hence, it has systemic and long-lasting effects. These effects include inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and activation of thrombotic pathways, all of which increase the plaque burden in the arteries of the heart contributing to the risk of heart attacks and heart failure.
By conservative estimates, every 10 µm/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 10% higher risk of death in vulnerable populations, including patients after a heart attack and other heart disorders. Let us explain. For example, if someone with heart disease lives in an area where average PM2.5 concentration is 15µm/m3 and then moves to an area where average concentration is 25µm/m3, his/her risk of premature death increases by10%. These estimates are based on population studies done in western countries where the concentration of PM2.5 ranges around 5-30µg/m3. In Pakistan, the average daily concentration approaches to over a 100 µg/m3 in urban areas such as Lahore and Karachi. We do not even know what the dose response curve is like for such high concentrations of PM2.5. In simpler words, the effects of exposure of PM2.5 on cardiovascular outcomes have not been extensively studied at concentrations that Pakistanis living in urban centres like Karachi and Lahore are exposed to.
However, it is well-known at concentrations below 50 µm/m3, and the higher the exposure to PM2.5, higher the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Whether this exposure/risk relationship plateaus at even higher concentrations is not well understood. In the worst case scenario, the risk would go up incrementally and in the best case scenario, the risk may remain the same. Though even in the best case situation, the risk is very high and in any western country, this high level of PM2.5 would have been unacceptable.
For Pakistan, we know that high levels of air pollutants have toxic effects for our citizens. We also know that we do not completely understand the scope of the adverse health effects of such high concentrations of air pollutants. But we do not know the unknown population level effects of chronic exposure to these levels of pollution.
 


In the above concept diagram, we attempt to illustrate the incremental risk of death in patients with heart disease, with higher exposures to PM2.5. What this curve looks like at PM2.5 concentrations that are common in Pakistan is not known. This is indeed a crisis. The threat to public health and well-being is real and cannot be under-estimated. But finding a solution to this will be a complex process and will involve thinking along long-term policies to limit emissions as well as short-term guidelines for citizens on methods they can employ to protect themselves.
The damage to mental health
Air pollution has also been reported to have deleterious impacts on the mental health of those exposed to it. Particulate matter in the atmosphere can get absorbed into the bloodstream and interfere with the functioning of our brain and the nervous system. This can include impairment when it comes to concentration, memory problems, and difficulty in emotional regulation, eventually leading to decreased productivity of the workforce and causing the national exchequer to lose billions of rupees annually.
Mental health professionals working in Pakistan have also observed an increased rate of relapse in patients affected by mental illness with the change of weather and air quality. While some may attribute it to the cold, it is highly likely that increased air pollution during winter may be leading to increased risk of relapse in patients affected by mental health problems. While we need more data to support this proposition, there have been sufficient anecdotal accounts by mental health professionals reporting an increased rate of relapse in patients living in more polluted parts of Karachi during the winter season.
Air pollution is especially bad for children’s mental health, since not only are children more exposed to its effects (due to a higher rate of breathing and more intake of pollutants) but the developing brain is more susceptible to harmful pollutants.
More on this: If you haven’t seen Lahore
This can have a long-term adverse impact on children’s ability to excel in education, form healthy relationships, and ultimately become productive members of society. Research has also shown that certain pollutants, such as lead, when inhaled by children can lead to a decrease in their IQ levels, decreased inhibition and increased violence in communities. Hence, air pollution is not just a health problem, but it can very easily turn into a much bigger societal, if not a security problem.
Pediatrics & early childhood development
In South Asia, it is estimated that approximately 12 million children are at risk because of air pollution. Previously it was thought that pollution only affects children because of respiratory compromise, but it is now clear that the respiratory component directly affects the neuro-development element because children respire more air per unit due to their surface area.
When air toxicity is at the level which Pakistan is currently experiencing, it is safe to assume that children will end up breathing in more toxic air. The toxic air that is breathed in directly compromises the neural connections that are made in the most important time of development: the first 1,000 days of life. Neural connections are affected because nano-particles can directly impede the blood-brain barrier and in turn can stimulate the brain to produce free radicals which damage the brain itself. These damages are not limited to just the structural component, but also affect brain functionality by damaging the white matter which is an important neural connection that regulates our body.
The blood-brain barrier keeps the blood from flowing into our brain — it’s like a filter mechanism that keeps excessive fluid and other substances potentially toxic for the brain from getting into it. Free radicals are ions that can cause oxidative damage to body parts, in this case the brain. So when the blood brain barrier is weakened, the brain receives more oxidative damage because of the free radicals.
Loss of function of the barrier and the radicals all contribute to inflammation. For an organ that is already sensitive and in its development stage, the stress alone can contribute to cognitive dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in IQ points (by approximately 4-6) which is a significant figure. Furthermore, the compounded effect of respiratory compromise due to pollution contributes to absenteeism, further limiting a child’s learning potential.
Thus, it can be hypothesised that the insidious effect of pollution further contributes to our morbidity and mortality, not just through physical disease but also with long-term damage that may contribute to early ADHD, Autism and probably Parkinson’s.
The way forward
Pakistan will have to deal with the issue of air pollution as a crisis and the country’s response will have to be multi-tiered and vary in temporality, since we need short-term, medium-term, and long-term changes. As medical practitioners, we’d leave the medium-term and long-term solutions to experts in that space, such as environmental engineers, energy professionals, and other industry experts. However, what we can urge them to do is to act now and act fast.
In the short-term, what we must propose is for citizens to take charge of their own health and well-being to the best of their abilities. Some simple measures that they must take up include purifying the air in places where they spend most of their time, such as homes and offices. Invest in air purifiers, there are many low-cost but effective local options available in the market now and the difference it will make to your feeling of well-being will be immediately noticeable. In addition, if your work involves significant time outside, then there can only be good that would come out of wearing a mask. An n95 mask would be ideal for this purpose.
This is what one can do to protect oneself and their loved ones. Now to people who can effect change, those who run industries, are in the energy sector, or work in the policy space, as physicians we urge you to consider the cost at which we are enabling economic growth. Members of our society, especially the ones who hold access to resources, must ponder the future we are building for ourselves and our children. As public health professionals, we can predict that if we continue on in the same direction, an apocalyptic future is not a dramatic hyperbole but a probable reality for the region.

Huang’s reported message, aimed at reassuring employees, comes after panic and confusion had ensued among tech workers on H-1B visas, a large chunk of whom are from India and China.
Akin to the wider chip and tech industry, Nvidia has a significant number of employees from overseas. Huang has repeatedly asserted that about half the AI researchers in the world are Chinese.
“As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we’ve found in America have profoundly shaped our lives,” Huang wrote in a message to staff, cited by Business Insider.
“And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration,” Huang added, according to the report.
Nvidia declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
H-1B visas allow businesses to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations.
Late in September, US lawmakers asked major US companies to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs.
According to the report, in his message to staff, Huang said that “legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas,” and that the Trump administration’s “recent changes reaffirm this.”

In Pakistan, 24-karat gold price was recorded at Rs425,178 per tola and Rs365,421 per 10 grammes, according the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association. The prices were based on the exchange rate in the interbank market.
The global rally in the precious metal also came after concerns that a tech-fuelled rally that has sent some equity markets to record highs may have gone too far, fanning talk of an asset bubble.
Traders have been piling into gold all year, pushing it up more than 50 per cent since the turn of the year, on the back of a range of issues including global economic uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade war and geopolitical crises.
Its allure was increased further this week by political turmoil in France, where the country’s prime minister resigned and President Emmanuel Macron’s former premier urged him to resign and call early elections.
Gold — long considered a go-to in times of uncertainty — climbed to a high of $4,006.68 on Wednesday, even as the dollar has pushed up against most of its peers in recent days. Silver was also within a few dollars of its own record high.
The closure of parts of the US government is adding to the sense of unease among investors, with key economic data, including on jobs, being postponed and muddying the waters for the Federal Reserve as it tries to decide on its rate plans.
“The rapid rise in gold prices has been supported by rising inflows into (exchange-traded funds) and central bank buying, including solid demand from China, as gold benefits from political, economic, and inflation uncertainty,” wrote Taylor Nugent at National Australia Bank.
While gold traders were busy pushing the metal ever higher, equity markets were more subdued in Asia as questions were asked about the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested in artificial intelligence.
The AI boom has seen some indexes and companies hit record highs, with chip titan Nvidia topping a $4 trillion valuation.
But a report that software firm Oracle’s cloud computing profit margin was much lower than expected sent shivers through trading floors, with all three main indexes on Wall Street falling into the red.
“In a market priced for perfection, any delay in cash flow — even a temporary one — feels like the bartender calling ‘last call’,” wrote Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.
“Traders didn’t wait for clarification; they simply started easing out of their positions. The Oracle story didn’t crash the party, but it definitely sobered it.” Tech firms, which have enjoyed strong buying this year and in recent months, led selling in Asia.
Hong Kong and Taipei were among the biggest losers, while Sydney and Singapore also fell.
Tokyo was marginally higher, helped by lingering optimism that the election of business-friendly conservative Sanae Takaichi as the ruling party’s leader will see more stimulus measures and a fresh push for monetary easing.
Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also edged up.

In a post on X on Tuesday, he said the PM had invited him for a meeting after his speech in the upper House of Parliament, and during the conversation, he told the premier: “If I can criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise if I make a mistake”. He added that he had told the PM that if he was wrong in his presumptions about the deal, “I apologise”.
In his Senate speech, Khan had referred to a photograph circulating on social media that showed PM Shehbaz, US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was holding an open briefcase that appeared to contain minerals. The photograph was released by the White House, after a September meeting of the three in the US, and showed Field Marshal Munir pointing to the contents of the briefcase and Trump looking at them.
Khan said in his speech in the Senate on Sept 30 that in the photograph, it seemed that a deal for the trade of rare earth minerals was being proposed. “Under what agreement, which law and the Constitution? This is dictatorship. This is, sorry to say, not democracy.”
He went on to question whether parliament held any importance.
Khan also spoke of the rights of smaller provinces and accused the ruling party in the Centre, the PML-N, of working on the terms of the military establishment.
 
 

The ANP leader also termed the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) — a committee that helps with foreign investments — an “unconstitutional institution”.
“The SIFC is financially taking Pakistan towards one unit. All your decisions are being made at one place … The SIFC is making Punjab’s agriculture policy […] It is the SIFC that is dealing with rare earth minerals,”  he alleged.
Following Khan’s speech, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar mentioned in the Senate on Tuesday that PM Shehbaz had met Khan and clarified details regarding his meeting with the US president.
Subsequently, Khan posted on X that after his speech in the upper house of parliament, the premier invited him for a briefing on his visit to the US.
“At the beginning of the meeting, he apologised to me and said that all of this should have happened in parliament prior to the US visit. I accepted his apology right away and said: “‘Look at my speech. I only talked about the supremacy of parliament. I did not ridicule anyone.’”
 






According to Khan, the premier clarified that he needed to take the army chief along with him on some visits. “Due to some strategic constraints, he takes the Field Marshal along with him,” he said.
“Referring to the picture of Trump, the Field Marshal and himself, [Shehbaz] said that the gift of minerals presented to the American president was purchased by the army chief from his own pocket and had nothing to do with any mineral deal — domestic or foreign,” Khan claimed.
The ANP leader said that he replied: “When I have the courage to criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise for my mistake. If this picture has nothing to do with the minerals of KP and Balochistan or any deal, then I apologise.”
He added that the people of KP and Balochistan had a right on the minerals in their respective provinces and they “should be included in this. We are neither against development nor betterment of the economy”.
On Monday, Dawn reported that the federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Khan and his family following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament.
Today, ANP spokesperson Engineer Ehsanullah Khan said Khan’s recent speech in the Senate was an “unconditional affirmation of parliamentary supremacy”.
“The ANP has always been a torch-bearer of the supremacy of parliament. It was also the central idea of the party president’s speech in the Senate,” his statement posted on the ANP’s X account said. It added that Khan’s statement also made it “clear that the government will ensure implementation regarding the rights of smaller provinces, as they were stated in the Constitution.”
He further stated that the ANP valued the national role of defence institutions, but was also clear that “all institutions should work within the bounds of the Constitution”.

Starmer’s first official trip to India, which he hopes will boost economic ties between the two nations, sees him accompanied by a 125-member delegation that includes top business leaders including British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle.
 






The two-day visit follows his July meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in London, where the pair signed the trade accord.
Starmer is due to meet Modi tomorrow, and address a fintech conference in Mumbai alongside him.
“With India set to be the third biggest economy in the world by 2028, and trade with them about to become quicker and cheaper, the opportunities waiting to be seized are unparalleled,” Starmer said in a statement.
India and its former colonial ruler are the world’s fifth- and sixth-largest economies, with bilateral trade worth around $54.8 billion and investments supporting more than 600,000 jobs across both countries.
 
 

The visit “will provide a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the shared vision of India and the United Kingdom to build a forward-looking partnership”, India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Under the new deal, India will slash tariffs on imports of British goods such as whisky, cosmetics and medical devices, while Britain will reduce duties on clothing, footwear and food products, including frozen prawns from India.
‘Britain not seeking visa deal with India’
However, Starmer ruled out expanding visa access for Indian professionals despite pressure from industry.
“That isn’t part of the plan,” he told reporters en route to Mumbai. “We’re here now to take advantage of the free trade agreement that we’ve already struck. We’ve got to implement it.
“Businesses are taking advantage of that. But the issue is not about visas.”
Starmer said that visas had blocked previous efforts to seal a trade deal, and that, having reached an agreement which had no visa implications, he didn’t wish to revisit the issue when he meets Modi tomorrow.
The British premier said visas would not be on the table in order to attract tech sector professionals from India, after United States President Donald Trump hiked fees on H-1B visas, though he said more broadly he wanted to have “top talent” in Britain.
 
 

Asked if he would stop issuing visas to arrivals from countries that won’t take back foreign criminals or people wanted to deport, Starmer said it was a “non-issue” with India as there is a returns agreement, but it was something he would look at more broadly.
“We are looking at whether there should be a link between visas and returns agreements,” he said.
Starmer is trying to take a more restrictive stance on both immigration amid high public concern about the issue, as his Labour Party trails the populist Reform UK party in polls.
Rights groups have urged Starmer to raise the case of Scottish Sikh blogger Jagtar Singh Johal, detained in India since 2017 over an alleged plot to kill right-wing Hindu leaders. He has not been convicted, and one of the nine charges against him was dismissed in March.</p><small>2025-10-08 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627540-federal-board-introduces-revised-grading-formula-for-ssc-hssc-exams' target='_blank'><strong>FBISE introduces revised grading formula for SSC, HSSC exams</strong></a><br><p>

In an interview with Bloomberg, the governor said any adjustment in the policy rate would depend on the outcome of the IMF negotiations and the economic impact of the recent floods. He added that inflation may temporarily exceed the SBP’s medium-term target range of 5 per cent to 7pc in early 2026 but is expected to remain within the range on average during the current and next fiscal years.
Analysts and independent economists have also ruled out a rate cut, citing the recent rise in inflation and the central bank’s cautious stance, which favours macroeconomic stability over short-term growth. Inflation rose to 5.6pc in September from 3pc in August, partly due to flood-related disruptions.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged in its last meeting, reflecting concern over inflationary pressures despite a generally stable trend since May 2025. During much of this period, inflation had remained subdued, but the central bank opted for caution.

Monetary policy decision hinges on IMF talks, inflation outlook

The World Bank, in a report released on Tuesday, projected Pakistan’s GDP growth at 2.6pc for FY26, reflecting subdued expectations amid structural challenges and ongoing macroeconomic adjustments.
Mr Ahmed told Bloomberg that the SBP had managed to build up its foreign exchange reserves by purchasing around $20bn from the interbank market over the past three years. “This was a carefully planned move. Without these purchases, our position would have been very different,” he said.
Commenting on trade, the SBP chief said Pakistani textile exporters are seeing increased interest from US buyers despite a 19pc tariff on their products. He noted that Pakistan has an opportunity to expand its exports as Indian textile goods face a 50pc tariff in the US. However, he acknowledged that high domestic production costs remain a significant barrier to fully leveraging the shift in global trade dynamics.
Exporters have raised concerns that, despite the apparent opportunity in the US market, the existing 19pc tariff — on top of a 10pc base tariff — makes it difficult for Pakistani goods to remain competitive due to rising input and energy costs. The governor said that while the window of opportunity exists, it would take time and policy support for exporters to benefit from the shifting trade environment fully.

Railways Minister Ha­nif Abbasi alleged foreign involvement, stating that India was behind the repeated attacks on the Jaffar Express. He affir­med that railway operations would continue desp­ite the incident.
The train was en route from Peshawar to Quetta when the blast occurred at around 8:15am, said Shik­a­rpur Deputy Commis­sioner Shakeel Ahmed Abro while speaking to the media on the scene soon after the incident.
He said there were no fatalities, and the seven injured passengers were promptly transported to Shikarpur Civil Hospital.
The injured included Muh­ammad Shafique, son of Abdul Azziz, a railway official, Muhammad You­nis, Hawaldar Javed, constable Abdul Rahman, con­­­s­table Azhar Jameel, besides two unidentified passengers.
Four of the more seriously injured were later shifted to the military hospital for further treatment.
Later, the deputy commissioner made it clear that all seven injured were in stable condition and that arrangements were being made to safely transport all remaining passengers to their destinations. He also confirmed that repair work on the damaged track was currently underway.
Tuesday’s blast is reportedly the seventh attack on Jaffar Express so far this year, starting with the deadliest episode in March, when terrorists killed 21 passengers after hijacking the train. Since then, the train has been attacked at least six times.
Talking to Dawn, Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi blamed India for the repeated attacks on Jaffar Express. However, he declared that the train’s operation to and from Balochistan would continue despite such cowardly attacks
“The terrorists targeting Jaffar Express again and again are, in fact, proxies of India that is not ready to digest and bear its defeat it faced during operation Bunyan Al Marsoos,” he said. “These incidents are cowardly act of India that is still feeling the pain of wounds it received during the May war,” he added.
In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said this time the terrorists selected the railway track near Shikarpur (Sindh). He said such cowardly attacks could not stop Pakistan Railways to cease the operations of Jaffar Express. “The train will continue operating as per routine, as we will never afraid of such attacks,” he said, adding that the security of the track and train would be tightened further.
He praised “brave drivers, guards and other crew members who continue to perform duties in this train despite such horrible incidents. I also salute our brave passengers who continue to travel by this train, giving a message to the coward terrorists that Pakistani people are a brave and great nation that would never surrender before such proxies. I also salute our armed forces that are endeavoring to eliminate such terrorists for the protection of citizens of Pakistan”.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident and sought an inquiry report from the police chief. He directed the Larkana commissioner to provide best medical assistance to the injured passengers.
Later, Sindh lawmaker Imtiaz Sheikh, along with DC Abro, visited Civil Hospital to inquire after the condition of the injured passengers, including Muhammad Younis and Muhammad Shafique.

The Bank of Punjab topped the list of publicly traded banks in the region with a market capitalisation greater than $100 million, delivering a total return of 176.4 per cent during the quarter.
The Lahore-based bank, with a market cap of approximately $320m as of September 30, outperformed other regional lenders. The Bank of Khyber, based in Peshawar, ranked second with a total return of 108.2pc. Other Pakistani banks among the top 15 performers included National Bank of Pakistan, JS Bank, Askari Bank, and Habib Bank, bringing the total number of Pakistani banks in the top rankings to six.

Six banks feature in the region’s top performers list

Pakistan’s benchmark KSE-100 index also saw notable gains, advancing 11pc in July and 11.4pc in September. Investor sentiment was bolstered by the resolution of a military conflict with India in May, as well as Pakistan’s growing diplomatic ties with the US. The report cited multiple meetings between key Pakistani leaders and President Donald Trump as key factors contributing to improved market confidence.
Indonesia-based banks also performed well, with PT Allo Bank Indonesia Tbk securing third place with a return of 89.2pc. Other Indonesian lenders like PT Bank Mayapada Internasional Tbk, PT Bank Neo Commerce Tbk, and PT Bank Ganesha Tbk were also among the top 15. Three banks from Vietnam, including Vietnam Prosperity Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which had the highest market cap of $9.34bn, also made it to the list.
In contrast, banks from China and India faced challenges. Seven Chinese mid-tier banks, including Bank of Jiujiang Co. Ltd and China Everbright Bank Co. Ltd, were among the worst performers, largely due to margin pressures and weak loan demand. Indian banks, such as Aavas Financiers and Dhanlaxmi Bank, also struggled in the rankings.
The worst-performing bank in the region was PT Bank Nationalnobu Tbk of Indonesia, which recorded a total return of -31.9pc. Bangladesh’s Midland Bank, which had topped the rankings in Q2, fell to the third-worst performer in Q3, with a return of -20.9pc. South Korea’s KakaoBank also faced a decline, with a return of -20.8pc.
While the overall performance of the Asia-Pacific region was mixed, Pakistani banks, particularly those in the public sector, performed strongly, benefitting from a favourable market environment and rising investor confidence.

• WB official says removing barriers to women’s participation in job market can boost GDP per capita by 20-30pc
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for Pakistan by half a per cent to 2.6 per cent for the current fiscal year due to the recent floods, which are also expected to push up inflation to 7.2 per cent.
“For FY 2025/26, real GDP growth is projected to remain around 2.6pc, as ongoing catastrophic floods have damped the forecast,” the Washington-based lending agency said in its regional economic outlook for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP) region.
The bank had earlier projected a 3.1pc growth rate for the country in its previous biannual outlook in April 2025. Pakistan had set 4.2pc growth target and has since been looking at 3.5pc as part of its IMF engagements.
“Early estimates suggest a drop of at least 10 per cent in agricultural output in Punjab, affecting major crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton, wheat, and maize,” it said. “For FY 2026/27, growth is expected to accelerate to 3.4pc, supported by higher agricultural output, lower inflation and interest rates, recovering consumer and business confidence, and a rebound in private consumption and investment,” it said.
 
 

Looking ahead, Pakistan, which had historically maintained high tariffs with a complex structure, stands to benefit in terms of exports and growth from a recently approved five-year reform plan (2025–2030) to reduce its tariffs by half, the lender said.
It said the country’s inflation rate dropped to single digits in FY2024-25, as price increases for food and energy eased. However, disruption to food supply chains due to ongoing catastrophic floods is expected to push inflation up through 2027, it said and also anticipated about 1.5pc decline in its global exports.
It said the poverty rate in Pakistan dropped by 9.4 percentage points between 2011 and 2018, the year of the most recent available estimate. However, a combination of economic shocks and natural disasters since 2020 is projected to have stalled this trend of poverty reduction. Furthermore, due to its relatively high poverty rate and large population, the country accounts for a large share of MENAAP’s (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) poor.
Regional economic outlook
Overall, the economic report pointed to an improved economic outlook for the region, with expected growth reaching 2.8pc in 2025 and 3.3pc in 2026. However, global uncertainty, trade policy shifts, and continued conflict and displacement all pose possible risks.
It said the countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will likely benefit from phasing out voluntary oil production cuts and growth in their non-oil industries while oil-importing countries are also expected to see economic improvements, thanks to private spending and investments as well as a rebound in agriculture and tourism. However, oil-exporting developing countries may see a significant slowdown because of conflict and reduced oil production.
Women’s talents and skills
The report said the countries in the region could improve more lives by tapping into the full potential of their workforce as women’s talents and skills remained significantly underutilised. The data shows that only about one in five women participates in the labour force—the lowest rate in the world—despite significant gains in education and skills.
“I urge bold action—not partial measures,” said Ousmane Dione, vice president for the World Bank’s MENAAP region. “To unlock the full potential of women in the region, we must tackle every barrier to their inclusion with comprehensive measures. A vibrant private sector that creates jobs and transforms aspirations is key to real progress.”
Drawing on analysis that considers household choices, social norms, legal rules, and the role of businesses, the report offers estimates of how much MENAAP economies stand to gain by removing the barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce. No other region stands to benefit more from eliminating these constraints.
“Increasing female labour force participation can translate into immense economic gains,” said Roberta Gatti, chief economist for the region. “Removing barriers that prevent women from accessing jobs could boost GDP per capita by 20 to 30 per cent in economies like Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan,” she said.
The report said the working-age population in MENAAP was set to grow by over 220 million people by 2050, close to a 40pc rise, the second-largest across all regions.
At the same time, the region is also rapidly approaching a demographic crisis, with declining fertility rates and an aging population.
Pakistan has one of the highest fertility rates in the region, at 3.5. However, its demographic transition is following a similar trajectory as its peers, only delayed, with the fertility rate projected to fall below replacement level within one generation. It said Pakistan was yet to achieve the female enrollment rates prevalent in the rest of the region (outside of conflict-afflicted countries).
Over the past 25 years, countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Algeria have made measurable strides in female labour-force participation, although rates remain among the lowest compared to their income peers. Notably, in Saudi Arabia, the participation rate increased by nearly 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2023. In Pakistan, it grew by 8 percentage points between 2000 and 2021.
In Pakistan, two-thirds of college-educated women are out of the labour force, despite having aspirations and job-application rates comparable to those of men. Importantly, marriage proposals often surge right after graduation, limiting the time available to women to search for a job.
The report noted that the United Arab Emirates (19 positive reforms), Saudi Arabia (18), Bahrain (12), Jordan (10), and Pakistan (8) were the top reformers in the region, particularly in areas such as the workplace and pay during the period since 2010.
