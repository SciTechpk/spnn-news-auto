A statement by the Presidency said that the joint sitting will convene at 11am on Friday. Besides a bill pertaining to the establishment of the Daanish Uni­versity, two proposed laws regarding domestic violence and human rights will also be tabled in the house.
President Zardari, who is a top leader of the PPP, returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the National Assembly.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry told Dawn that the PPP’s concerns had been addressed by the government. He hoped all three bills would be cleared in the joint session. The PML-N leader said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had met a PPP delegation, comprising Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, and Farooq H. Naek, to assure the ruling partner that the proposed legislation would not impact the 18th Amendment, which had devolved education to provinces.

PML-N leader says PPP reservations addressed; PTI declares opposition will contest proposed legislation

“We have informed the PPP lawmakers that the Daanish Schools scheme is a flagship project of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif under which community schools and education institutions are being established in all four provinces… Besides, these educational institutions are also being set up in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir,” he added. The minister said a separate meeting was held with the leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, in which the PML-N also addressed their concerns.

 

According to Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government has already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and all three bills will be passed in the joint sitting.
PPP leader Sharmila Farooqui, however, said that the government could not table the same university bill that was rejected by President Zardari. She said her party expected that the new bill would address the concerns expressed by the PPP. “We believe that education is purely a provincial subject and the Centre should not interfere in it,” she added.
PTI chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, said the opposition would oppose all three bills in the joint sitting.
President approves judges’ confirmation
Separately, President Zardari approved the confirmation of 27 additional judges of the Sindh, Lahore, and Peshawar high courts.
For the Sindh High Court (SHC), the statement said the president had approved the confirmation of all 10 additional judges recommended by the JCP.
President Zardari also approved a six-month extension in the tenures of Justices Khalid Hussain Shahani and Syed Faizul Hassan Shah of the SHC, the statement added.
For the Lahore High Court (LHC), President Zardari confirmed all 11 additional judges recommended by the JCP. He also approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa as an additional LHC judge, according to the statement.
For the Peshawar High Court (PHC), he approved the confirmation of six additional judges. He also approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justices Farah Jamshed, Inamullah Khan, Sabitullah Khan and Aurangzeb as PHC’s additional judges.

DAVOS: Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt will reopen next week after largely being shut during the Israel-Hamas war, the Palestinian technocrat leader backed by Washington to administer the enclave announced on Thursday.
Ali Shaath made the announcement by video link during an event in Davos hosted by President Donald Trump, who convened a group of leaders to formally launch a “Board of Peace” initially focused on cementing Gaza’s ceasefire.
A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire, brokered by Trump in October, has been the reopening of Gaza’s main gateway to the world to allow the entry and exit of Palestinians.
“I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions. For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate. It is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said.
“Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war,” Shaath said.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has controlled the Rafah crossing since 2024. The ceasefire deal left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, including the area that abuts the border crossing. Hamas controls the remainder of the enclave.
Israeli strikes kill five
In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli air strikes on Thursday killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord. Israel has continued to carry out air and artillery strikes in Gaza.

 

Health officials at Al Shifa Hos­pital, Gaza’s largest, said four Pale­stinians were killed by Israeli tank shelling in the Zeitoun suburb of eastern Gaza City. A fifth person was killed by Israeli fire in Khan Yunis in the south, health officials said.
A day earlier, Israeli fire killed 11 people including two boys and three journalists, health officials said.
On Thursday, Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the three journalists, who press advocates said had been using a drone to film tents housing displaced people.
US sanctions on NGOs
Hamas on Thursday condemned as “unjust” a move by the United States to sanction Palestinian associations which Washington accused of having links to the movement.
The US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on six nonprofit organisations working in the Gaza Strip, which the Treasury Department said “claim to provide medical care to Palestinian civilians but in fact support the military wing of Hamas”.
It also announced sanctions on a group of Palestinians involved in civilian flotillas that aim to break Israel’s sea blockade on Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid.
The Treasury Department said the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad has been “a main organiser” of the flotillas and charged that it was “clandestinely acting on behalf of Hamas”.
“We view these decisions as unjust and oppressive,” Hamas said in a statement, suggesting the sanctions were incited by Israel as a fight against the Palestinian “national cause”.
All the organisations were accused of “secret ties to Hamas” in the US Treasury statement. The sanctions will block any assets the groups have in the United States and criminalise transactions with them.
Hamas called on Washington to walk back its decision.

PARIS : The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned Washington on Thur­sday that his force has its “finger on the trigger” following mass protests, even as US President Donald Trump insisted the Islamic Republic appears ready for negotiations.
Gen Mohammad Pakpour, the Guards’ commander, cautioned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations by learning from historical experiences and what they learned in the 12-day imposed war”.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief [Khamenei] — a leader dearer than their own lives,” Pakpour said in a statement quoted by state television.
While the prospect of immediate American action against Tehran appeared to recede this week, tensions remain high. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said the US struck Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
“Can’t let that happen,” Trump said. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
Gen Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who leads the Iranian joint command headquarters, warned that if the US attacks, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would become “legitimate targets”.
Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the US would “wipe them off the face of this earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.
The warnings come as Iranian leadership faces the aftermath of protests that began in late December. A violent crackdown has quelled the movement, accompanied by what the monitor NetBlocks called a “national kill-switch” internet blackout now in its second week. Iranian authorities on Wednesday released their first official toll from recent protests, stating 3,117 people were killed.
Trump-Zelensky meeting
Separately, Trump declared that Russia’s war on Kyiv “has to end” after holding a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos on Thursday. Following the discussion, Zelensky reported progress on peace talk negotiations and discussions regarding air defence supplies.
When asked by reporters what his message was for Russian President Vladimir Putin — who is scheduled to meet with a US envoy in Mos­cow later — Trump was direct.
“This war has to end,” Trump said. He described the encounter with the Ukrainian leader as positive.
Zelensky characterised the talks with his US counterpart as “productive”. Writing on the social media platform X, he indicated that diplomatic efforts between the two nations are intensifying.







Greenland deal
Meanwhile, Trump said he had secured total and permanent US access to Greenland in a deal with Nato, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China. The development came as Trump backed off tariff threats and dismissed seizing Greenland by force, reducing tension in transatlantic relations.
“It’s really being negotiated now, the details of it,” Trump told Fox Business Network from the World Economic Forum. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told Reuters in Davos it’s now up to senior commanders to handle extra security details.
“I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026,” he said.
While the news triggered a rebound in European markets, officials remain cautious. Dan­ish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen clarified that while security talks are progres­sing, no negotiations occurred regarding sovereignty over the semi-autonomous territory.
“It is still a difficult and serious situation, but progress has also been made in the sense that we have now got things where they need to be. Namely that we can discuss how we promote common security in the Arctic region,” Frederiksen said.

“The state should no longer be held responsible for cases of self-imposed disappearance,” Sarfraz Bugti said during a meeting on the matter.
He said the issue had now been addressed through legal means, adding that if anyone chooses to go into hiding on their own, responsibility cannot be attributed to the state.
Mr Bugti stressed that names of individuals who voluntarily associate with ‘militant’ or ‘separatist’ organisations should not be classified as “cases of enforced disappearance”.

 

“Unfortunately, state institutions have repeatedly been maligned in the past, but such narratives must no longer be used as a tool for propaganda,” the chief minister said.
Mr Bugti recalled that the United Nations had spelt out a “clearly defined mechanism” regarding missing persons, emphasising that the provincial government respected internationally recognised procedures and legal frameworks on the matter.
“The government of Balochistan remains committed to transparency, rule of law, and addressing legitimate concerns through constitutional and legal channels,” he said.
A day earlier, Mr Bugti said security forces in Balochistan often conducted intelligence-based operations where suspects were detained for investigation.
However, he added, the new legal framework would ensure transparency and accountability.

He announced PTI’s dissociation from the bill and sought its withdrawal.
Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the Chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
Tax bill
On Thursday, the House also passed the Income Tax Third Amendment Bill 2025, moved by Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, who said it aimed to safeguard taxpayers’ rights and strengthen the Alternate Dispute Resolution Com­mittee.

The National Assembly was informed that billions of dollars in investment had been attracted through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said investments had come across multiple sectors, supported by initiatives such as the investment policy and revised visa policy. Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani added that the SIFC functioned as a single window to promote investment and transparency.
Furthermore, seven new bills were laid before the assembly for consideration. These included the National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority Bill, the National Archives Amendment Bill, 2026, and the Abandoned Properties Management Amendment Bill, 2026.

LAHORE: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on kite flying in public parks and greenbelts on Basant, as the Lahore administration decided to digitally monitor the three-day festival, starting Feb 6, to ensure compliance.
PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad said the decision was made to ensure that kite flying and related celebrations did not harm trees and other park infrastructure.
“Since the Basant festival is being held for three days in Lahore alone, the arrival of a number of people from other cities of Punjab, other provinces and abroad is expected here for kite flying and other related activities.
In such a situation, the people may rush for the public parks and green areas for kite flying and other related celebrations…” he told Dawn.

 

He said the decision was made to prevent any untoward incident, including damage to the plants, greenbelts and other infrastructure.
“Lahore, in addition to its huge number of permanent residents, may also have a considerable number of people from other cities and countries starting from the Feb 4 evening, since Feb 5 is also a public holiday (Youm-i-Kashmir),” he added.
“The parks would remain open to the people, but they wouldn’t be allowed for kite flying,” he said, adding that the PHA enforcement staff has been put on high alert.
According to an official notification by the PHA, the directors concerned have been asked to ensure strict implementation of the ban within their respective zones.
The authority emphasised that any violation of these instructions will be considered unacceptable, and in case of any damage or untoward incident, the respective director would be held responsible.
Digital monitoring
Meanwhile, the city district administration said that strict digital monitoring of Basant would be carried out through drone cameras and the Lahore Safe City Authority’s cameras. A control room would be set up at the DC office.
It was revealed in a meeting presided over by Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz.
“Kite flying will only be allowed from Feb 6 to 8, whereas the material will be sold through registered dealers alone,” the DC said while speaking on the occasion.
He said that kites bigger than the ap­­pro­ved sizes will be prohibited. More­over, none of the bikers would be allowed to drive without safety wires. Basant would only be allowed at specific grounds or no­­tified rooftops, including in the Walled City or other locations across the district.
Registration of kite manufacturers
On the other hand, as many as 2,437 kite manufacturers, sellers, traders and associations have applied for registration with the city administration for the festival.
According to a document seen by Dawn, as many as 1,334 kite sellers applied for registration till Jan 22, 2026. Out of this, 161 applications were currently in process, whereas 1,107 had been approved.
A total of 838 kite manufacturers applied for registration, 697 applications had been approved, whereas 85 were in process. However, 51 applications were rejected.
Similarly, 250 kite traders applied for registration, out of which 19 applications were in process and 223 had been appro­ved. Eight applications were rejected.
Moreover, 18 kite flying associations applied for registration, of which 12 were approved, two are in process, while four applications were rejected.
It is pertinent to mention that the provincial government decided in December last year to celebrate a limited Basant in Lahore with strict conditions.

“Safeguarding an employee’s right to be considered for promotion in a timely manner is a right,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik, adding that the government departments cannot take shelter behind their inefficiencies and inactions by relying on Section 8(3) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act 1974, as they are responsible for ensuring timely promotions.
The observation came in an appeal of Fakhar Majeed before the Supreme Court, which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Ayesha A. Malik, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim had taken up against a February 16, 2024, order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, which had dismissed his plea.
The Supreme Court, however, ordered the Punjab Irrigation Department to grant promotion to the employee from 2012 and held the department responsible for an “unjustified”, “negligent”, and “inefficient” delay in processing his promotion for over a decade. The petitioner stated that he was entitled to a proforma promotion, effective January 18, 2010, as the vacancy for the post of draftsman (BPS-14) became available on that date. 

Court says civil servants should not suffer due to procedural delays, inaction of government departments

The department, on the other hand, pleaded that in terms of Section 8 of the Act, the employee did not have any right to seek proforma promotion from the date of vacancy, rather promotion was to be granted with immediate effect.
Petitioner Fakhar Majeed was appointed on Oct 30, 1999, and later promoted to the post of draftsman on current charge basis three times in BPS-10 through letters dated Dec 11, 2008, June 2, 2010, and Nov 12, 2011, for a period not exceeding one year under Rule 10(b) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Condition of Services) Rules 1974 or till the arrival of regular incumbent whichever is earlier. 
A Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was convened in 2012, but his case was not considered. This became the subject matter of a dispute between the parties. 
The employee was ultimately recommended for promotion to the post of draftsman by the DPC held on May 4, 2019, and thereafter promoted through an office order of May 7, 2019. 
The petitioner claimed that he was not treated fairly and was denied the lawful right of being considered for promotion in 2012. The issue, therefore, is the petitioner’s request for regular promotion to the post of draftsman (BPS-14) with effect from Jan 18, 2010.
Authored by Justice Malik, the seven-page judgement observed that it must be remembered that promotion in public service was not a gratuitous benefit, rather it was tied to merit, performance and operational needs of the state.
Once an employee satisfies the prescribed eligibility criteria, a corresponding duty devolves on the competent authority to consider the case, failing which a reasonable timeframe must be documented, Justice Malik observed.
By relying on Section 8(3) of the Act, the department actually tried to nullify the delay, its mismanagement and inefficiency. Fairness, transparency and timeliness in promotion matters are critical to keep employees efficient and motivated, the judgement emphasised.
It said that a delay, failure to convene DPC, or prolonged reliance on current charge or acting arrangements cannot be used to defeat the right of an eligible civil servant to timely consideration for promotion, and that a civil servant cannot be made to suffer for omissions, inefficiency or inaction.
The Supreme Court ruled that the tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that the employee was unjustifiably deprived of the promotion, and set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction that the petitioner be deemed promoted with effect from Jan 21, 2012.

• iPhones see steepest cuts  • Values apply regardless of condition; accessories not included
• Phones must be activated six months before import      
ISLAMABAD: As mobile phone prices remain elevated for new buyers due to higher assessed values, the Customs Valuation Department has reduced assessment rates for duties and taxes on the commercial import of used and old mobile phone sets to ease pressure on consumers in the used smartphone market.
At the same time, fresh assessment values have been set for high-end used iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 14 and its variants to the iPhone 15 series. For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.
The revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.
Customs officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.
The downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.
Officials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
The government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.
A comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.
Among the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.
The iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.
Even newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.
The department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.
For the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.
Samsung, Google, OnePlus
By contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.
Other Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.
For Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.
A similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.
According to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.
It further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.
Customs officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.
For brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.

Trump lashed out after publication of a New York Times/Siena University poll finding only 40 per cent approval for the 79-year-old Republican — in line with multiple other polls showing declining support a year into his second term.
“The Times Siena Poll will be added to my lawsuit against The Failing New York Times,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “They will be held fully responsible for all of their Radical Left lies and wrongdoing!”







Expanding on the threat, Trump posted that “Fake and Fraudulent Polling should be, virtually, a criminal offence”.
Trump has fired off multiple defamation lawsuits against media companies, including the BBC, CNN, Wall Street Journal, CBS and ABC. Some have ended in multi-million-dollar settlements.
He first filed a $15 billion defamation suit against the Times in September 2025, claiming the leading US newspaper had run false stories to hurt his 2024 presidential campaign and reputation.
The complaint was thrown out by a federal judge before being refiled in amended form in October.
The Times responded by calling that new lawsuit “an attempt to stifle independent reporting” and “intimidation”.
Thursday’s Times/Siena poll was the latest opinion survey finding that Trump’s popularity continues to slide over his handling of the economy and a military-style crackdown on illegal immigration.
Times/Siena is considered to be among the most accurate and highest profile of US political surveys.
Its latest findings were especially notable for laying out what the Times called the unravelling of Trump’s winning 2024 coalition.
Young and non-white voters who turned out for Trump in the election against Democrat Kamala Harris have now left him, the poll found, leaving him with his previous core base of older and white voters.</p><small>2026-01-22 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2220545941f86e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968444/govt-defends-decision-to-join-trumps-board-of-peace-amid-opposition-outcry-in-na' target='_blank'><strong>Govt defends decision to join Trump’s Board of Peace amid opposition outcry in NA</strong></a><br><p>Amid an outcry by the opposition in the National Assembly, the government on Thursday defended its decision to join the Board of Peace led by US President Donald Trump, saying it was taken in the interest of the Palestinian people.
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said Pakistan had a principled position on the Palestine issue and always raised it at international forums.
He said Pakistan’s decision to join the board was guided by national interest and the collective priorities of the Muslim Ummah, not political considerations.
He noted that UN Security Council resolutions called for a permanent ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, adding that Pakistan’s participation in the board aimed to support these efforts while safeguarding both Palestinian and national interests.
He stressed that the matter should not be reduced to political point-scoring, urging unity and consensus in the House.
Meanwhile, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned against becoming part of any campaign to disarm Hamas. He said that those responsible for the Palestinians’ plight were part of the board.
“Expecting peace from Trump tantamounts to living in [a] fool’s paradise,” he said on the floor of the house.
He highlighted that Trump was the board’s chairman and appointed members at his own discretion, while also noting that he had abducted the Venezuelan president and his spouse.







“We must not accept the Board of Peace under any circumstances. No so-called peace board in the form of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acceptable at all,” he stressed.
He said that Gaza was continuing to be bombed and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu would sit “shoulder to shoulder” on this board.
Fazl highlighted that more than 70,000 civilians were killed by Israel during its two-year onslaught in the Gaza Strip, adding, “If anyone has seen so many corpses in a single year, it is the Palestinians”.
The JUI-F chief said that over 100,000 Palestinians had died of hunger and over 150,000 had been rendered homeless. He regretted that Pakistan’s policies were “formed under international pressure”.
“We have never formulated our foreign policy purely for our own national interest,” he remarked.
He also questioned why parliament was not consulted on the decision to join the board.
“It is the government’s duty to inform [parliament] about the decisions it is making,” he emphasised. “If you do not take the house into confidence, fine; but did you at least take the cabinet into confidence?”
Noting that the board was formed despite the existence of the United Nations and its Security Council, Fazal questioned whether it amounted to a parallel authority.
“Wherever they [US] go in the name of peace, they leave destruction behind,” Fazl said. “They turned Afghanistan into ruins, Iraq into ruins. They came to Libya and devastated it; to this day, it has not recovered.”
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also regretted that PM Shehbaz had joined the Board of Peace without any consultation.
“Yesterday, the Foreign Office stated that it had joined the Board of Peace. The government ignored the house,” Gohar said, stressing that Parliament must be informed about the conditions of joining the board.
“Will you play any role in disarming Hamas?” he asked. “If it were a United Nations body, the government could have acted on its own. The Board of Peace is not a United Nations body.”
PTI urges govt to withdraw paticipation, hold consultative process
Speaking to Dawn, PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that it was unfortunate that the government did not bother to take such a sensitive decision with consensus.
“They should have at least discussed it in parliament to give a false impression to the global community that we have democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
Qaiser said that there could be severe repercussions of joining the board as it would compromise Pakistan’s ties with other Muslim countries and the people of Palestine.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Dawn that the hearts of Pakistani people beat with the hearts of the Palestinian people.
“There is not a single Palestinian representative on the Board of Peace. Any decision that will not be acceptable to the Palestinians will not be acceptable to the PTI,” he said.
“It seems that Trump has ambitions which go beyond Gaza,” he said. He said the US president wanted to bypass the United Nations and use the board for “his own plans”.
The PTI also issued a statement, which said that the party did not accept the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace.
The party emphasised that decisions of international significance should always be made following consultations with all major political stakeholders and with full transparency.
“The government should at least have discussed such a major decision openly within the available parliamentary structures before moving forward,” the statement, posted on X, said.
The party added that Pakistan’s participation in any international peace initiative should “complement and reinforce the United Nations’ multilateral system”, rather than creating parallel power structures that could adversely affect global governance.
“Under former prime minister Imran Khan’s leadership, [the] PTI has consistently emphasised that Pakistan’s foreign policy must safeguard national sovereignty, uphold constitutional norms, and reflect a broad national consensus,” the party said.







It added that the PTI stood with Palestinians and, as such, “will not accept any plans against the wishes of the people of Palestine”.
“We are deeply saddened and concerned by the atrocities and oppression they continue to face, and we strongly desire that the Palestinian people achieve their freedom and secure their legitimate rights,” the PTI added, reiterating its stance on the creation of an independent Palestinian state with Al-Quds Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital.
It added that this position was articulated by party founder Imran during his tenure as prime minister and reflected Pakistan’s commitment to human rights and international law.
“[The] PTI calls upon the government of Pakistan to withdraw any formal participation in the Board of Peace until a complete consultative process has been conducted,” the PTI said, outlining the various steps of the process.
These included thorough parliamentary scrutiny and debate, consultation with all major political leadership — including Imran — and conducting a referendum on the board’s membership “to ensure public confidence”.
“[The] PTI reiterates that Pakistan must continue to act as a responsible, principled, and peace-oriented nation, whose global engagements reflect dignity and legality, consistent with the charter of the United Nations and are based on national consensus,” the party concluded.
PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, in his own post on X, also slammed the government’s decision, calling its haste “not only inappropriate but also beyond comprehension”.
“It was the government’s responsibility to take parliament into confidence on this important matter and inform it of all details, which has not been done,” he said.
He reiterated Imran and the party’s “absolutely clear and unequivocal” position that the PTI would not support any agreement that violated the rights of the Palestinian people, or which the Palestinian people reject.







Speaking to Dawn separately, Senator Zafar said, “In my view, [this] is such an important step, with far-reaching consequences for the nation, [that] cannot and must not be decided unilaterally by the executive or the federal government alone.
“A decision that affects the future direction of Pakistan, its foreign policy, and its moral standing must be taken by parliament, representing the collective will of the people,” he emphasised.
The senator noted that there are two competing viewpoints on this issue.
“One maintains that by joining this force, Pakistan may be indirectly facilitating the broader strategic objectives of Israel and thereby becoming complicit in the subjugation of the Palestinian people,” he explained.
“According to this perspective, Pakistan should not become part of such a force.
“The other view is that the Palestinians themselves are calling for assistance, and that this is a moment when Muslim countries must stand together,” Zafar stated.
He added that proponents of this view argue that since countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkiye are reportedly part of the force, Pakistan should also participate in solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
Replying to a question, Zafar said: “Before deciding which view is correct, all relevant facts must be placed before parliament, so that the nation may reach a collective, informed decision.”
He noted that critical questions remain unanswered, such as who is in command of the Board, its terms and conditions, Pakistan’s precise role and whether or not the Palestinians have requested Pakistan’s help.
“What conditions, if any, are being imposed upon Israel?” he asked. “What are Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and other participating countries conveying diplomatically? What are the strategic, legal, and moral implications for Pakistan?
He emphasised that these and many other questions must be answered transparently before any final decision is made.
“Ultimately, the first priority must be the best interests of Pakistan; namely, its sovereignty, security, constitutional order, and long-term foreign policy objectives,” Zafar stated.
“The second, inseparable priority must be the legitimate rights and welfare of the Palestinian people.”
He stressed that only parliament has the constitutional legitimacy to weigh these interests and decide on such a momentous issue.

Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed issued a list of 67 individuals, only seven of which had been identified. Earlier in the day, she had issued a list confirming the deaths of 50 people.
A separate statement issued by the Sindh health department spokesperson also said that the post-mortem examination of 67 bodies had been conducted.
The updated death toll comes a day after officials found the bodies of 30 people from a single shop on the mezzanine floor. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that urban search and rescue teams were conducting a search operation with the help of a thermal imaging camera (TIC).
“Urban search and rescue teams are working at the incident site and using specialised tools and cutters,” he said. The official said that the camera detected heat up to 1,500°C. However, the temperature of the shopping mall was higher, affecting the remains of the victims, he regretted.
He said that officials had never experienced such an incident in recent memory, adding that cooling work had been ongoing for the past three days.
He said that the building’s structure was dilapidated, due to which authorities were exercising extreme caution during the search operation.
He said that there was no way inside the buildings due to which rescue workers cut through the walls, which triggered “vibrations”. Therefore, the work, which should have taken 10 to 20 minutes to finish, took between one and two hours.
He said that a team from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) had also visited the plaza. According to the Rescue 1122 spokesperson, the SBCA informed them that the building would be demolished after the search operation was completed.
Sources familiar with the preliminary findings of the committee tasked with investigating the devastating fire told Dawn that the blaze started from a shop selling artificial flowers on the ground floor due to the alleged negligence of the owner.
They said the shop owner had been traced and interviewed and he told investigators that his two minor sons were playing in the shop while he was away.
While playing, they lit a match and threw it into the shop without putting it out before leaving, the sources said. As a result, the shop caught fire due to the presence of combustible material, the sources added.
An official told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the shop owner’s account was also corroborated by other witnesses. He said that since it was an accident, the owner or his sons had not been detained.
Relatives criticise pace of rescue operation
Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains.
Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”.
“That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said.
Some families also staged a protest outside Gul Plaza on Thursday, criticising the slow pace of the operation.
The protestors said that almost six days had passed but their children were still buried under the debris.
SBCA begins fire safety assessments
The SBCA, meanwhile, said it had initiated fire safety assessments in Karachi on the directives of Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah.
A statement issued by SBCA Director General (DG) Muzammil Halepoto’s office said fire safety arrangements in 35 of the city’s buildings, including both residential and commercial ones, had been carried out.
It quoted Halepoto as saying that the “functionality of firefighting and emergency systems” was being assessed in the exercise and notices for corrective measures would be issued to the owners of buildings with faulty fire safety systems.
Halepoto further stated that fire safety notices had been issued for 266 buildings in Karachi, which also included those covered in a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) survey. He recalled that the KMC had also issued directives to builders, building owners and unions in January 2024 to ensure fire safety.
The official warned that buildings lacking firefighting tools and safety measures within the given time would be sealed.
The SBCA DG asserted that fire safety assessments would continue in the city to ensure emergency preparedness.

There is an emerging political discussion in the country about raising the voting age from 18 to 25. While no formal bill has been tabled yet, the idea is being floated through media commentary, social media narratives, and informal political signalling.
On Wednesday, five senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat opposed any change in the voting age, asking whether those “operating in the dark” were afraid of the youth’s power.
In a post on the social media platform X, Iqbal said, “Reports of increasing voters’ age from 18 years to 25 years are baseless. There is no such legislation under consideration.”
In the video accompanying the post, the minister said, “We have confidence in our youth and we can’t even think of depriving them of the right to vote.”







“These [reports] are part of [our] opponents’ disinformation campaign,” the minister added.
Iqbal further reiterated that there were no such plans to increase the voting age, nor was the government intending to table any legislation in the upcoming joint session, which is scheduled for Friday.
“Pakistan’s youth are our asset and they are capable of deciding what is best for the country’s future,” he said.
“Therefore, I strongly refute this as all the reports are mere rumours,” he said.
In the letter which emerged on Wednesday, PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omar Sarfraz Cheema had termed apotential move of raising the voting age “a clear sign of fearing the power of informed conscience”.
They said the youth’s insight, perception, decision-power and collective wisdom was the nation’s asset and could be used to do wonders in the country. The PTI leaders had also expressed the hope that all political parties in the country, particularly the PML-N and the PPP, would not support any fear-driven mindset to suppress the youth’s right to vote.</p><small>2026-01-22 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22171727d61c5d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968437/sindh-home-minister-orders-inquiry-after-journalist-arrested-for-allegedly-firing-injuring-citizen-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh home minister orders inquiry after journalist arrested for allegedly firing, injuring citizen in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar on Thursday ordered an inquiry after Model Colony police arrested journalist Shahab Salman for allegedly firing a gun and injuring a person.
The journalist’s arrest came after a first information report (FIR) was registered against him under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 324 (attempted murder) and 337A(i) (causing a head injury) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant, who operates a “cable network”, alleged that he and his friends had met for tea at a restaurant on Wednesday night, when Salman and three others drew a pistol and started firing, resulting in a bullet injury to his thigh.
He further alleged that the suspect was spreading fake news against him on social media for “blackmailing purposes”.
Subsequently, the Sindh home minister took notice of the arrest and sought details from the Korangi senior superintendent of police (SSP), according to a statement.
“Merit, transparency and impartiality should be given focus,” Lanjar said in the statement, adding that all media organisations should be taken into confidence and that a thorough inquiry be conducted.
“I assure my journalist brethren that merit and transparency will be ensured during police investigation,” he added.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the police said the Shah Faisal Colony superintendent of police (SP) and SP Investigation had been appointed as investigating officers for the inquiry.
The statement quoted the Korangi SSP as saying that the two officials  should ensure merit and transparency in the inquiry and that a complaint by the journalist’s wife should also be made a part of the probe.
Salman’s wife had filed an application with the Model Colony police alleging that certain elements wanted to occupy the land of a bus terminal in Model Colony. She said her husband had exposed the land grabbing “while performing his professional duties”, leading the complainant to “threaten him”.
“Suspects riding four motorcycles on Wednesday night arrived at the restaurant and threatened my husband,” she alleged in her application. “He (Salman) took out a licensed pistol and resorted to firing in self-defence,” she said.
She further stated that they had sought protection from the police, which was not provided and accused the suspects of “being supported by political elements”. She further alleged that the suspects beat her husband while he was in police custody.
Meanwhile, separate statements issued by the Karachi Press Club (KPC) and Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the arrest.
“Arresting a person who opened fire in self-defence instead of the attacker is worrying,” the KUJ’s president and secretary said in a joint statement.
It added that some elements had been threatening Salman for reporting the news over several days and that after opening fire in self-defence, Salman himself had approached the police for help but was refused.
“Not only did they file a case against him, aiding the criminals, but they refused to accept his wife’s application,” the statement added.
“High-ranking police officials should take notice of this matter and bring justice to the journalist [and] the authorities should ensure a transparent investigation,” the statement said.
The KPC also demanded that Salman be released immediately and that an impartial investigation be conducted into the incident.
“KPC President Fazil Jamili, Secretary Aslam Khan and the executive council have expressed deep concern over the attempted attack on Salman, a senior member of the press club, and his subsequent arrest,” the statement said.
It noted that Salman was a “responsible and professional journalist” and that if he were threatened or attacked, law enforcement agencies’ first responsibility should be to provide protection to him and take action against the real suspects.
“Arresting a senior journalist on the basis of self-defence is upsetting and concerning, while the impression that the victim should be blamed instead of the complainant is also extremely dangerous,” the statement added.
The KPC, alongside demanding Salman’s release and a transparent probe, demanded the assurance that journalists would not face harassment or retaliation while carrying out their duties.</p><small>2026-01-22 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/222228061a3a822.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968453/india-condemns-alleged-act-of-vandalism-at-embassy-in-croatia' target='_blank'><strong>India condemns alleged act of ‘vandalism’ at embassy in Croatia</strong></a><br><p>India on Thursday condemned an alleged act of vandalism at its embassy in Zagreb as Croatia promised to prosecute the offenders.
The Indian foreign ministry said that an act of “trespassing and vandalism” at its embassy in the Croatian capital was committed by “anti-India elements” without providing further details of the incident.
“We have taken up the matter strongly with Croatian authorities and asked them to hold the perpetrators accountable for their reprehensible and illegal actions,” a ministry statement said.







Indian media reported that a video had been posted online, purporting to show Khalistan activists removing the Indian flag and replacing it with the yellow flag representing the Sikh separatist movement.
AFP could not verify the video, while police and the embassy did not immediately respond to questions.
The Khalistan movement seeks an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory.
The Croatian foreign ministry strongly condemned the incident and added that the interior ministry was pursuing the perpetrators.
“Any violation of the inviolability of diplomatic missions is unacceptable and contrary to international law,” the ministry said in a statement on social media.</p><small>2026-01-22 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221306495ac7420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968422/mqm-p-demands-karachi-be-made-federal-territory-be-declared-financial-capital' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P demands Karachi be made ‘federal territory’, be declared ‘financial capital’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Thursday called on the federal government to declare Karachi a federal territory by making it the country’s “financial capital”.
The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs).
Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”.
Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases.
Article 149 enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “manner in which the executive authority thereof is to be exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity or economic life”.
Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh.
“We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later.
“A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed.
Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation.
‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’
The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”.
“End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said.
He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system.
Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”.
“The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said.
“They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”.
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A.
However, after both amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment.
On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management.
Memon assails MQM-P for ‘politicising’ Gul Plaza fire
On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon lashed out at the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza incident.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he regretted that “certain parties” were attempting to politicise the Gul Plaza fire incident, and asserted that the Sindh government was displaying “great patience”.
“You call yourself the entire city’s party, so you have the full right to criticise, but they start making other sorts of statements in the guise of criticism,” Memon said, indirectly mentioning Kamal’s press conference from a while before.
“Will ending the 18th Amendment and handing over Karachi to the Centre prevent such incidents?” the PPP minister asked.



“We are not evading our responsibility,” he asserted, acknowledging that the protection of the public’s life and property.
He quipped, “This (Gul Plaza fire) was an incident. […] But those who have carried out such incidents in this city with their hands are making such remarks.
“Those parties are talking that have even burned people alive for extortion,” he alleged.
Memon said he was “forced to respond” as “serious allegations” were being made against his party.
“The Baldia factory was set on fire, innocent people were deprived of their lives, and the human hunting game was played on May 12, 2007, […] such statements from your mouth do not suit you.”
The PPP leader then played some old video clips of Kamal, wherein he could be heard making allegations against his current party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and coalition ally PML-N, as well as hurling abuses in public.
Memon said he had responses for each statement made by Kamal, but he would “not fall in that trap”.
The PPP leader questioned why Kamal, being the federal health minister, had not paid a visit to Gul Plaza or asked if his help was needed in any matter.
“When your quaid (Altaf Hussain) used to give a strike call, when your workers used to count a score of 100 and kill people on the roads, and when bodies in sacks were found daily, did you not remember humanity then?”
Responding to a query, Memon said he was unable to “comprehend the objective” of the recent statements made by Kamal and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif.
Speaking on the Gul Plaza incident, Memon affirmed that the Sindh government was working on the “one-point agenda” of returning the remains of the victims to their loved ones.

 

“Neither can there be a price for a valuable life, nor can there be any substitute,” the minister said, reiterating that the government stood with the survivors during this “difficult time”.
Of the 1,200 shops in Gul Plaza that suffered damage, he said: “We will not argue about how many of these were legal and how many were built afterwards. Whoever has suffered damages and however much, the Sindh government has said that it stands with them and considers it its responsibility to get them back on their feet.”
Memon added that the government was also planning on giving interest-free loans to shop owners of Gul Plaza to help them.
According to Memon, Sindh’s Rescue 1122 received 1,094 reports of fire incidents across Karachi in 2025, while 84 such incidents were reported this month so far.
“It will come forward how this incident happened, how rescue efforts were carried out — if there is any shortcoming anywhere, the government will take action against it,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-22 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2219262807b9b94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968447/state-minister-claims-reduction-in-islamabads-allergy-cases-amid-criticism-over-widespread-tree-felling' target='_blank'><strong>State minister claims reduction in Islamabad’s allergy cases amid criticism over widespread tree felling</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As authorities draw criticism over the large-scale cutting of trees in Islamabad, Minister of State for Health maintained on Thursday pollen allergy cases in the federal capital had been on a decline following targeted felling.
He expressed these views during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change, which was chaired by PPP Senator Sherry Rehman and focused on the management of paper mulberry trees and ecological restoration in Islamabad.
Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in Islamabad, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. Islamabad’s CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies. WWF-Pakistan had also disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development.
During the briefing on Thursday, the state minister shared the National Institute of Health’s data in connection with mitigating Islamabad’s severe seasonal pollen crisis.
According to Malik, cases of pollen allergy declined from over 2,300 in 2023 to 1,031 in 2025, while overall allergy prevalence in Islamabad fell from 45.8 per cent in 2023 to 33.3pc in 2025.
This, he said, indicated a reduced per capita risk of pollen allergy despite population growth.
Malik said that the invasive paper mulberry, the scientific name for which is broussonetia papyrifera, was a non-native species and was introduced in Islamabad between the 1960s and 1980s.
“It now accounts for approximately 94pc of Islamabad’s total pollen burden,” the minister added.
He further said that the federal capital faced a “critical pollen crisis” for more than two decades, with total pollen count reaching an unprecedented 82,000 grains per cubic meter of air in 2022.
Pollen from paper mulberry, he said, posed “exceptional health risks due to its lightweight particles, which penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger severe allergic rhinitis, acute asthma exacerbations, and life-threatening status asthmaticus (acute asthma)”.
In this connection, the minister highlighted the importance of the ecological restoration programme for re-planting native species of trees in Islamabad.
He termed the initiative a vital public health intervention and said it was projected to reduce respiratory allergies in the capital by over 40pc, significantly easing seasonal burden on hospitals and emergency departments.
Meanwhile, he continued, to prevent the “aggressive re-sprouting [of paper mulberry trees], the ministry, in coordination with the Capital Development Authorty (CDA), is implementing a strict three-step eradication protocol involving cutting, complete uprooting of the root system, and soil compaction”.
“Of the approximately 80,000 paper mulberry trees identified for removal across Islamabad, 29,115 have been cleared to date, with priority given to high-density areas including F-9 Park and Shakarparian,” he said.
Moreover, the committee was informed that ecological restoration remained central to the initiative.
The minister further said that under the restoration policy, three indigenous trees were being planted for every paper mulberry removed.
By April, approximately 90,000 native trees, including Kachnar, Amaltas, Desi Toot, and drought-resilient Pilkan, would be planted to restore the capital’s natural ecosystem, he said, adding that the initiative is supported through public-private partnerships with contributions from Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, Mira Power and Beaconhouse.
The minister concluded his briefing, noting that the initiative aligned with international best practices in urban environmental health governance, as adopted in countries such as the United States and Australia.
He expressed hope that, by April, the project would be completed in accordance with approved technical protocols, including full ecological restoration through the plantation of indigenous species.
Meanwhile, Senator Sherry Rehman, the chairperson of the committee, urged the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination to establish expert committees — including wildlife specialists, ecologists, environmentalists, and civil society representatives — on parks and tree management.
According to a handout, she said, “Tree plantation and tree removal are highly technical processes. We need proper committees, sub-committees, experts on board, and credible public hearings”.
She said that the public’s concerns must be addressed through credible, transparent processes.
“It is the capital city of Pakistan; its green spaces are essential to conserve and preserve. We must add to Islamabad’s natural green cover, not diminish it,” she said.
She concluded by urging the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and the CDA to establish a proper consultation and coordination matrix, and expert-led committee structure, ensuring that environmental protection remains central to development planning.</p><small>2026-01-22 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221628191efb3f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968433/pm-shehbaz-other-world-leaders-sign-charter-for-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, other world leaders sign charter for Trump-led Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders on Thursday signed the charter for the “Board of Peace” headed by United States President Donald Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts.
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Trump — who is the chairman of the Board of Peace — said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular”.
“That’s the way it goes in life,” he said.
“Congratulations, President Trump. The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

 


“Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories.
“Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said.
The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.”
Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a “New Gaza” during the ceremony, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as “great real estate.”
Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.”
Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace.
After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council.
While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN.
Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump.
Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join.
France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so.
However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza.
Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony.
Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation.
Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony.
‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump
During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement.
“They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said.
“We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”.
“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”.

 

Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”.
“We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones.
The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes.
“Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.”
Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons.



‘New Gaza’ plans
A large part of the ceremony was devoted to talking about its plans for shattered Gaza.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former property developer like the president, showed slides of what he billed as a “master plan” for Gaza’s reconstruction.
The slides included maps of new settlements in the Gaza Strip and artist renderings of gleaming seafront hotels and apartments under the caption “New Gaza”.
“It could be a hope. It could be a destination,” Kushner said.
Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues.
“If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said.
“The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.”
Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff also spoke on the occasion.
In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”.
He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring.
“I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.”
The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.”
Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”.
He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”.
“Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added.
Brazen disregard for int’l law, human rights: Amnesty
Meanwhile, Amnesty International termed the ceremony marking the Board of Peace’s establishment a “brazen disregard for international law and human rights”.
“It also represents a stark new manifestation of the escalating assault on United Nations mechanisms, international justice institutions and universal norms,” the rights body said in a statement on X.
Amnesty further noted: “At the direction of its to-be chairman, President Trump, with its membership comprised of US allies including a few heads of state he has personally invited, the putative mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the international legal system that underpins the global order.







“It is a slap in the face of decades of efforts to strengthen global governance through adherence to universal values and greater equality between member states and derails legitimate efforts to address the current system’s limitations and gaps.”
Amnesty emphasised that now was “precisely the moment that international law must be upheld, defended and enforced; not abandoned in favour of ad hoc arrangements shaped and distorted by political and economic interests, personal ambition or vanity”.







Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official
The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath, the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan.
The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far.







“I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony.

 

“For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said.
As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza.

The first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn, was registered on the complaint of Abid’s brother, Tahir Wazir Khan at Lahore’s Jauhar Town under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting with the intent to secretly and wrongfully confine a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In the FIR, the complainant recounted a telephone conversation between his brother and the KIPS general manager, identified as Lubna.
He said his brother called Lubna shortly after leaving a corporate office in Jauhar Town in his car on Wednesday at 6:34pm.
He quoted Lubna as saying that she heard a knock on the car’s window, followed by a voice saying, “You have caused an accident involving my car”, after which the call ended.
“Unidentified suspects have kidnapped my brother and his life is in grave danger,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying.</p><small>2026-01-22 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221922171de279b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968446/u19-world-cup-pakistan-beat-zimbabwe-by-8-wickets-advance-into-super-six-round' target='_blank'><strong>U19 World Cup: Pakistan beat Zimbabwe by 8 wickets, advance into Super Six round</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan clinched a comfortable 8-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in Harare during the team’s last group-stage match in the ongoing U19 World Cup, advancing into the Super Six round.
After facing a 37-run defeat by England in their tournament opener, the Green Shirts made a comeback, beating Scotland and Zimbabwe in back-to-back matches.







With the win, Pakistan has secured second place in the group rankings, with England on top.
As per the tournament’s format, the top three teams from the four groups will qualify for the Super Six round, where they will be divided into two groups of six teams, each playing two matches.
This means that despite the loss, Zimbabwe will also advance into the Super Six stage.
Pakistan U19 captain Farhan Yousaf had won the toss and elected to field first at Takashinga Sports Club.
Pakistan’s bowlers maintained a strong grip over the Zimbabwean batters, with a dominating performance by Ali Raza, who took three wickets and bowled four maiden overs.
Mohammad Sayyam, Abdul Subhan, and Momin Qamar also grabbed a couple of wickets each for Pakistan.
For Zimbabwe, Nathaniel Hlabangana could only score 59 runs; no other batter could assist him in keeping the momentum and building the partnerships. Eight Zimbabwean batters could not even reach double figures.
Pakistan bowled out Zimbabwe on a score of just 128 runs in 35.5 overs.
While chasing the target, Pakistan’s batters outshone the Zimbabwean bowlers by achieving the total in the 27th over, with the fall of two wickets.
Sameer Minhas won the player of the match, with an unbeaten 74 off 75 deliveries, including six boundaries and four sixes.







Minhas was aided by Usman Khan and Ahmed Hussain, who scored 26 and 24 runs, respectively.</p><small>2026-01-22 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646617-technical-committee-recommends-demolishig-blaze-hit-gul-plaza-once-search-ends' target='_blank'><strong>Technical committee recommends demolishig blaze-hit Gul Plaza once search ends</strong></a><br><p>

Reports of rain were received from Surjani, North Karachi, Scheme 33, Super Highway, Defence Housing Authority, Sohrab Goth, Clifton, Sharea Faisal and Gulistan-i-Jauhar.



Data from the Met Office showed that the highest amount of rainfall in Karachi fell in Surjani Town, with 26.3 millimetres (mm) of rain recorded as of 5pm.
The lowest readings were in Kemari and the old airport area, with trace amounts of rainfall, while Orangi Town, Quaidabad, Saddar and Bin Qasim saw no rain at all.
In other parts of Sindh, Jacobabad and Sukkur experienced the most rainfall, with each recording 10mm of rain. The least fell in Shaheed Benazirabad and Sakrand, with both recording 1mm each. Karachi only received trace amounts of rainfall, according to the data.
Meanwhile, an alert by the traffic police at 3:49pm said Hub River Road had been closed for vehicles headed toward Dabba Mor as water from a drain had spilled over onto the road due to rain.
Traffic was being diverted toward Baldia Town from the Surti graveyard, the alert said.







The traffic police also issued an advisory, urging citizens to drive slowly, keep headlights on, exercise caution near electricity poles and dilapidated buildings and avoid going near poles and broken wires.







Earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast cloudy weather in Karachi for today, saying that there were chances of rain.
In its three-day weather forecast issued on January 22, the PMD said a westerly wave was likely to grip Sindh, adding that dust-thunderstorms and light to moderate rain were expected in Karachi.
The forecast said highs of 23-25 degrees Celsius and lows of 13.5°C were expected today. It added that humidity was predicted to decrease from 84 per cent in the morning to between 50pc and 60pc in the evening, with a west/northwesterly wind.
Over the next two days, it further stated, temperatures are expected to drop, with highs of 20–22°C and lows of 7–9°C each day. Dry weather and cold nights are forecast throughout.
Additionally, both Friday and Saturday are forecast to be less humid than Thursday, with morning humidity at 40–50pc and 45–55pc respectively, dropping to 15–25pc in the evenings.
The PMD added that a north/northwesterly wind is expected on Friday, and an east/northeasterly wind will likely blow in the metropolis on Saturday.
Besides the Karachi division, it said, rain is also expected today in Jamshoro, Dadu, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Naushahro Feroze, Shaheed Benazirabad, Khairpur, Sukkur, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Larkana, Qambar Shahdadkot and Shikarpur districts.
In view of the PMD’s rain forecast for the city, Mayor Murtaza Wahab instructed the Karachi Metropolitan Cooporation (KMC) teams to remain alert.
In a statement, Wahab noted that all pumping stations across the city have been made functional for the timely discharge of rainwater.
He further affirmed that teams were on the ground to “continuously monitor” if citizens needed any help.
The mayor also issued directives to establish an emergency cell to deal with any untoward situation.
On Wednesday, the PMD said that rain and heavy snowfall will affect all provinces as well as the northern regions on January 22 and 23, as the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority issued an alert and asked citizens to take precautions.</p><small>2026-01-22 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646621-jui-f-pti-question-govts-intent-behind-joining-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition questions govt's intent behind joining Trump's Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>

Last year it collapsed. This has stalled the birth of an agreement that could begin to rein in production of a fossil-fuel-based material that is harming ecosystems on every part of Earth.
The treaty seemed to be the latest victim of a struggling multilateral system. Shifting geopolitics, changing national positions and the global influence of fossil fuels are frustrating the broader work of curbing climate change – humanity’s common interest.
I reported on the plastics negotiations over this period, watching as 184 countries seemed increasingly unable to find common ground. With so much at stake, one absence in particular seemed to weaken the process: the ability, when countries could not reach full consensus, to make a decision anyway based on a two-thirds majority vote.
Arcane as it sounds, this omission lurked behind some of the most dramatic negotiation scenes, and still haunts other environmental processes today, including the UN’s climate negotiations.
This is the story of how voting is an ever-present obstacle to the global plastics treaty, what it reveals about political will, and why, despite the process fizzling out, I believe there is still a desire in many quarters to reach an ambitious deal.
Resistance mounts against a vote
Paris, France, May 2024:
When countries gathered to begin textual negotiations on the plastics treaty, a small group soon began to question the rules of procedure. Though hard to detect behind the practised calm of negotiators, a mighty conflict was brewing.
Saudi Arabia, backed by Iran, India, Brazil and China, took the floor. They challenged a standard rule in UN negotiations that allows a decision to be passed by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot been reached. After hours of plenary statements and rebuttals, Saudi Arabia delivered the clincher. It would “not be moving forward [with negotiations] until the rule is bracketed”.
Words are bracketed in international negotiations to indicate disagreement over their inclusion in the final text. Requesting brackets at this stage was an attempt to kick voting into the long grass.
Negotiators ultimately spent two of their five days wrangling over this point, until – anxiously watching the clock – they effectively agreed to bracket the voting rule. The decision was accompanied by a statement noting the issue still hadn’t been resolved, in case it came up in a future discussion. But that discussion never came, and the voting rule was never applied.
To the treaty novice I was at the time, it wasn’t immediately clear why this mattered. But treaty die-hards saw eerie echoes of what had happened at the start of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to negotiate curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.
Back in 1991, a group of petrochemical-rich countries wrestled the voting rules for UNFCCC negotiations into brackets, where they have now been gathering dust for 35 years. Many people told me this move has been responsible for slow action on climate change today.
Voting is standard in other multilateral environmental agreements. The High Seas Treaty, the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions on dangerous chemicals, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, for example, all allow decisions by a majority vote.
That being said, those UN environmental agreements that allow voting still prefer consensus, reserving voting for decision deadlocks. The desire to avoid a vote pushes countries “to find common ground” instead of overriding a minority, says David Azoulay, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law:
“Knowing a vote is possible is all you need to create the incentive to actually negotiate in good faith. Because nobody wants to find themselves on the losing end of a vote.”
Without that pressure, a country may simply veto a decision it dislikes, potentially due to vested interests. Where environmental issues intersect with economic interests, that is a particular risk.
In the UNFCCC process, “petrostates succeeded in arranging consensus as the rule of procedure” and have thereby stalled progress since 1991. That’s according to Nona Chai, programme coordinator for the Just Transition Alliance, a coalition of environmental justice groups and labour unions.

Last year, Chai attended the COP30 climate conference in Brazil. She says the no-voting norm has made it easier to block key proposals, such as language previously agreed at COP28 on “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. This was opposed by Saudi Arabia and a handful of others, and ultimately removed from COP30’s final text.
Many of the same countries now seem to see plastic as a way to keep extracting the fossil fuels that underpin their economies. Production limits brought on by a global plastics treaty could threaten that. What unfolded during 2023’s Paris plastics talks, therefore, triggered alarm bells that the same old tactics were being used.
‘Us’ and ‘them’
Busan, South Korea, November 2024:
Journalists jostled into the press room, briefly warming the frigid air of the cavernous conference centre, where the fifth (and supposedly final) plastics treaty meeting was underway. A panel of negotiators were making a rare speech, about a proposal to reduce global plastic production to sustainable levels.
Most country delegates, civil society representatives and scientists in attendance believed production limits were key to a successful treaty. This is in line with the 2022 UN Environment Assembly resolution that created these negotiations. It mandated that the talks should tackle pollution across the entire plastic lifecycle. But over the preceding four meetings, countries had broadly split into factions for and against this issue.
Several factors had stoked the division. At the third meeting in Nairobi in November 2023, a cluster of petrochemical-producing countries formed the “like-minded group”. It pushed for waste management over production cuts. A fourth meeting, in Ottawa in April 2024, featured aggressive pro-plastic ad campaigns and almost 200 petrochemical lobbyists, exposing corporate influence on the process.
By the Busan meeting, the US – a major treaty player – had started rolling back its support for production cuts. (Later, under President Trump, this evolved into an allegiance with oil-rich states, and secret pressure on countries to reject production limits.)
The press briefing in Busan made it clear that the majority was trying to keep a production limit on the negotiating table.
Wearing his trademark straw hat, Panama’s lead negotiator, Juan Carlos Monterrey-Gomez, said countries opposing limits had “not moved a centimetre”. He urged them to negotiate to meet the majority halfway. And with something approaching anger, he had a message for those unwilling to do so: “Please leave it to the rest of us and get out of the way.”
If anyone was looking for a sign that multilateralism was flailing, this atypical “us” and “them” framing was it.
Behind the scenes, the like-minded minority had been suggesting “no text” or “no article” on production reduction, meaning no mention of it. “When we started to talk about the text among those of us who wanted it, they didn’t want to have that conversation,” Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, told me at the time. He said they used several tactics to shut it down. “It was an impasse.”
Meanwhile, I watched as these countries kept raising the importance of consensus in plenaries and public statements – despite reportedly not engaging in the normal processes of discussion and compromise needed to reach it.
This tendency has crept into other multilateral spaces. Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement, told Carbon Brief that “consensus” has come to be misunderstood as “unanimity”. A decision doesn’t actually need the unreserved agreement of everyone. In difficult decisions of all shades, consensus is achieved through flexibility and compromise, delivering a compromise that all parties are satisfied with, if not necessarily ecstatic about.
In Busan, it seemed, the fears expressed 18 months prior in Paris had become real. Without voting, a handful of countries hiding behind the cover of consensus had been emboldened to veto the majority.
Cacophonous collapse
Geneva, Switzerland, August 2025:


On a sweltering summer night, exhausted delegates gathered on a manicured lawn at the UN headquarters in Geneva — Emma Bryce via Dialogue Earth

It was the final day of the sixth UN plastics treaty meeting, called after the fifth in Busan had failed to reach an agreement. People had been waiting hours for the final text.
Just before midnight, everyone was summoned into the vast plenary hall, and an expectant hush fell. But then Luis Vayas Valdievieso, the meeting’s chair, explained that the treaty was still not ready. “This plenary is adjourned!”, he boomed, banging his gavel down. Almost 4,000 delegates let out a roar of frustration. At 31 seconds, it was the shortest plenary in UN history. It seemed to symbolise a process in crisis.
The anticipated text was expected to be a significant upgrade on a draft Valdievieso had released the day before, which had provoked widespread outrage and despair. It remains unclear why, but that draft barely resembled what most negotiators wanted. A section on production controls was replaced with pollution measures only, language on regulating harmful plastic chemicals was erased and the agreement was no longer legally binding.
Camila Zepeda, Mexico’s lead negotiator, described that draft to me as “an empty shell.”
The text had been roundly rejected, pushing countries back into negotiations to try and develop another draft. That still wasn’t ready by the midnight plenary on the final day. When Valdievieso gavelled that bafflingly brief plenary to a close, the meeting moved into overtime and he held informal meetings with countries to try and reach some resolution.
Ultimately, they could not agree on a final text. At a final closing plenary just after 5am, Colombia captured the sense of frustration, saying the process had been “consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement”. Two months later, Valdievieso resigned as chair.
A vote for the future
How different would things be if voting had been part of this fraught process? Azoulay feels sure it would have at least brought an agreement “very, very much closer”. Voting in multilateral environment agreements, intended as a last resort, has become one of the only available tools to defend multilateralism.
Having watched the process unfold, along with others, I feel unsure whether voting could realistically have closed the gaping void between the countries on either side of this issue. In other words, voting is not a substitute for political will.
Fernando Tormos-Aponte, policy lead at the Just Transition Alliance, worries that a voting process might just encourage countries that dislike a negotiated outcome to leave the whole process, as the US has done with the Paris climate agreement. “If [the plastics treaty] becomes too ambitious, the US won’t sign it, just like they didn’t sign Kyoto and just like they eventually withdrew from Paris.”
I consulted Alexandra Harrington, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Plastic Pollution Task Force. She sees things slightly differently. Fighting harder for voting at the commencement of the plastics negotiations would have helped, Harrington says, by immediately revealing countries’ true intentions.

A vote demanded by the majority in the early days of the treaty may have pushed the blockers to actually consider whether they could commit and negotiate in good faith, or if they would prefer to exit the negotiations. It also helps avoid a situation where ambition is compromised by a minority that may never even ratify the agreement.
“I think voting brings more honesty to that process,” says Harrington.
Along these lines, some have suggested that those countries that do actually want a treaty – the so-called “coalition of the willing” – could break out of the UN system and begin a new process among themselves.
That idea is not unique to the plastics treaty. Frustrations with the creaking, consensus-focused multilateral system also surfaced at COP30. As it ended, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a separate global conference for nations willing to transition away from fossil fuels.
A new plastics process that at least includes the world’s major plastics consumers could be effective in reducing production and pollution, experts argue. It could shift the markets, even without the world’s biggest plastics and petrochemicals producers on board.
Others say an agreement outside the UN could be effective if it includes China, the world’s biggest plastic producer.

This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.
David Azoulay, Center for International Environmental Law

Some national negotiators I spoke to in Geneva said it is important not to knock multilateralism when it is already down, and therefore to stay within the UN. But Azoulay feels the damage is already done, pointing to the plastic treaty process itself: “This is how you undermine the multilateral system, by making it useless.”
For most nations, an exit may be a step too far for now. “I believe there’s not enough appetite to move outside of the UN system,” says Felix Wertli, Switzerland’s lead negotiator in the plastics treaty process.
An alternative could be for some of the measures of the plastic treaty to be adopted under an existing international agreement, such as the 1989 Basel Convention, Wertli says. That convention includes the possibility to vote.
The plastics treaty process will continue in some form. The next step is for countries to elect a new chair to replace Valdievieso at a one-day meeting scheduled for February. This meeting won’t include formal negotiations but countries can raise procedural issues. Harrington says voting rules could come up.
Formal negotiations are due to resume at some point after that. Voting is still an option. As Harrington points out, it is hibernating in the rules of procedure, ready to be reawakened by a party bold enough to roll the diplomatic dice: “You need one country that is willing to just put its hand up and say, okay, we’re calling for a vote.”
Future momentum
Amid the various twists and turns of the plastics treaty process, one thing seemed clear to me throughout: there is huge momentum to reach a deal. It is embodied by the activists who turned up, year after year and at great expense, to fight for the cause. It is in the mounting science, and the raw emotion of negotiators who wept in the final plenary.
But even as that momentum grows, tonnes of plastic continue to be churned out, advancing one of the planet’s richest and most destructive industries. While many mourn the treaty’s apparent collapse, some are celebrating it.
Ultimately, the world’s majority wants a treaty that begins to reduce the damaging impact of plastic on people and planet. History will judge the treaty by whether it achieves that goal.

The two met with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

 


PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir also attended US President Donald Trump’s address to world leaders at the WEF held on Wednesday.
Field Marshal Munir and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on the sidelines of the WEF, just before the signing ceremony for the Board of Peace Charter.
In a post on X, Dar said he and the field marshal met Fidan moments before the ceremony, writing, “Pakistani and Turkish nations share a strong bond which has stood the test of time and is cherished deeply by both nations.”







The premier is on a three-day visit to the Swiss town (from January 20-22), and is leading a high-level delegation.
On Wednesday, the prime minister had addressed a breakfast event at the Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the WEF in Davos. In the address, he said that export-led growth was the only way forward for Pakistan.
In his remarks, the premier said Pakistan “is moving forward with a sense of achievement and a sense of purpose”, noting a drop in the inflation rate and a reduction in the policy rate.
The premier also met International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
According to the PMO, he briefed Georgieva on the improvement in Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, stabilisation efforts and progress on institutional reforms.







PM Shehbaz stressed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal discipline, revenue mobilisation and sustainable development, the statement said.
The prime minister had also met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on the sidelines of the WEF.</p><small>2026-01-22 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221810586a51ea6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968441/psychiatrist-suggests-kids-should-only-get-smartphones-after-the-age-of-12' target='_blank'><strong>Psychiatrist suggests kids should only get smartphones after the age of 12</strong></a><br><p>Ran Barzilay, a psychiatrist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, won’t be letting his nine-year-old son get a smartphone before age 13.
He made the decision based on data from his recent study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, which linked getting a smartphone at a young age to worse health consequences.
Kids who owned a smartphone by age 12 had a greater risk of depression, obesity, and insufficient sleep compared to those who didn’t, a research team led by Barzilay found.
That was based on observational data collected between 2016 and 2022 in an ongoing study of more than 10,000 children across the United States. Designed to assess brain development and child health, the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study has been following children for the last decade, starting from ages nine to 10 into early adulthood.
The age at which kids got a phone in this cohort ranged from four to 13, with a median age of 11.

“We’re not advocating for people to go back to the Stone Age. We know that eventually, almost every teen will get their smartphone,” said Barzilay, the study’s lead author.

Smartphone ownership is high among US children and teens. Nearly 60 per cent of parents of an 11- or 12-year-old said their child owned one in a 2025 Pew Research Centre survey.
By comparison, 29pc of kids ages 8 to 10 and 12pc of 5- to 7-year-olds had smartphones, the survey found.
Concern about the impacts of mobile devices comes as rates of depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety have been rising among US youth over the last decade. Though screens are unlikely to be the only factor, many studies have linked excessive use to worse mental health.
That’s not to say smartphones don’t have benefits. The devices can help youth stay connected with people and address safety concerns parents may have.
“We’re not saying smartphones are bad, but we’re not saying they’re good,” Barzilay said.
To him, the takeaway is that parents should consider how giving a child a smartphone could impact their kid’s health.
“Make sure that it doesn’t consume all of their life,” he said.
What the data says
Barzilay’s team first compared the health outcomes of children in the study who owned a smartphone by age 12 to those who didn’t.
Those who had the device had a 31pc greater risk of depression, a 40% greater risk of obesity, and a 62pc greater risk of insufficient sleep, which in this case meant getting less than nine hours of sleep.
They next found that there was a roughly 10pc increase in the odds of obesity and insufficient sleep at age 12 for each year younger than 12 that the child received a smartphone.

Earlier age of ownership, however, was not associated with a higher risk of depression.
A limitation of the study is that the researchers did not have data on what children were doing on their smartphones. They could not account for whether the child was exposed to adverse content on their device, or what they tended to use it for.
His team’s last analysis zeroed in on the children who did not already have a smartphone at age 12.
A year later, at age 13, roughly half of the kids in that group had received one. That came with a higher risk of having mental health problems and insufficient sleep compared to half who had not received a smartphone.
His team controlled for factors, such as income, parental education level, puberty, parental monitoring, and whether the kids had tablets, laptops, or a smartwatch, that might also affect the outcomes.
However, other factors not captured by the research, which relied on observational data, still may have contributed to the outcomes identified.
What parents can do
It’s important to keep in mind that these findings speak to broad trends seen in the population and wouldn’t predict a specific child’s outcome, Barzilay said.
“We need to remember that this is on average,” he said. “It doesn’t say anything for the individual child.”
His oldest two children, who are now in high school, received their first phones before age 12.
If parents give their child a smartphone, they should check in regularly to see how it impacts the child’s lifestyle. Screen time shouldn’t come at the expense of sleep, physical activity, or quality time with friends and family.

Barzilay also suggested having the child keep their smartphone out of their bedroom at night and having tech-free family time, such as during dinner.

Ultimately, he would encourage parents to make an informed decision on smartphone ownership for their child based on the evidence out there on the harms and benefits.
“Things that can help families delay the use of phones will probably make sense,” he said.

According to ESPN Cricinfo, the decision was announced after a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul, CEO Nizamuddin, Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul and several national team players.
“Our only demand is to play the World Cup – but not in India,” the BCB president told reporters.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it would not be making any changes to the World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.
“We will go back to the ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” the BCB president said.
“They did give us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million people watching the World Cup (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss…”
“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” the BCB’s Bulbul said.
“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure,” he said.
Meanwhile, Nazrul said, “There is no scope for changing our decision.”
He said Bangladesh’s security concerns “did not arise from speculation or theoretical analysis”.
“They arose from a real incident – where one of our country’s top players was forced to bow to extremists, and the Indian cricket board asked him to leave India,” he said.
“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.
Following yesterday’s decision by the ICC, Islam had said Bangladesh players were keen to play in the World Cup and that he was “hoping for a miracle from the ICC.
“Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” Islam said on Wednesday.
“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Islam had said.
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22164200ed87d8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968435/nestle-announces-60m-additional-investment-in-pakistan-to-expand-operations-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Nestle announces $60m additional investment in Pakistan, to expand operations in country</strong></a><br><p>Nestle on Thursday announced that it would invest an additional $60 million in Pakistan and would also “undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country”.
The development came as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met Remy Ejel, the executive vice president and chief executive officer for Asia, Oceania, and Africa at Nestle, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.







The ministry said Aurangzeb chaired a high-level business roundtable on the sidelines of the WEF, bringing together chief executive officers and senior leaders of leading global corporations to discuss Pakistan’s reform trajectory, investment climate, and long-term growth potential.
“The roundtable formed part of the government of Pakistan’s ongoing engagement with multinational investors to promote policy predictability, economic formalisation, and sustainable, export-oriented growth,” it said.
“A major highlight of the discussion was the announcement by Ejel … of an additional investment of $60 million in Pakistan. Ejel stated that Nestle will undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country, reaffirming its long-term commitment to Pakistan,” the statement said.
“He further announced that Nestle intends to use Pakistan as a regional manufacturing and export hub, exporting products to 26 countries from Pakistan. Expressing strong confidence in Pakistan’s economic outlook, Ejel foresaw robust growth in Nestle’s business in Pakistan in the coming years,” the statement said.
According to the finance ministry, the announcement builds on the company’s recent engagement with the minister in Islamabad, where the company had “outlined its strategy centered on localisation, advanced manufacturing, sustainability, and agricultural transformation”.
The statement further said that Ejal noted that Pakistan’s demographic profile, growing nutrition needs, and underpenetrated value-added food segments closely mirrored successful growth trajectories seen in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb welcomed the announcement and described it as a “strong vote of confidence in Pakistan’s economic reforms and formalisation drive”.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening the tax ecosystem, ensuring policy consistency, and facilitating responsible long-term investment through continued engagement with the private sector, including via the Tax Policy Office established within the Finance Division,” the statement said.
The minister also emphasised that Pakistan offered compelling opportunities in affordable nutrition, climate-resilient dairy, localised sourcing, and export-oriented manufacturing, and reiterated the government’s resolve to position Pakistan as a competitive base for regional production and global value chains.
Azerbaijan’s Socar signals investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector
A separate handout by the ministry said that following the high-level business roundtable chaired by Aurangzeb, the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Socar) announced that it was set to finalise its investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector in February.







The announcement was made by Socar’s president, Rovshan Najaf, during the roundtable, the statement said.
Socar viewed Pakistan as a natural long-term energy partner, pointing to the country’s market depth, rising energy demand, and reform momentum in the oil and gas sector, the statement quoted him as saying.
He added that Socar’s planned investment would build on its existing commercial footprint in Pakistan and expand cooperation across the energy value chain, it said.
He noted that the company was already in a commercial engagement in Pakistan through Socar Trading, providing Pakistan with flexible liquefied natural gas arrangements.
Najaf also noted Socar’s engagement with Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and expressed interest in expanding cooperation across the broader oil and gas value chain as Pakistan continues to implement energy-sector reforms. He emphasised Socar’s experience as a peer national energy company from an emerging economy, positioning it as a credible long-term partner for Pakistan’s energy sector.
Meanwhile, the finance minister reiterated the government’s commitment to attracting strategic and commercially viable investment in the oil and gas and mining sectors, describing these areas as central to Pakistan’s energy security and industrial growth.
“He noted that ongoing reforms are focused on improving pricing transparency, contractual clarity, and risk-sharing mechanisms to support sustained private-sector participation,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646598-pm-shehbaz-other-global-leaders-sign-trump-led-board-of-peace-charter' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan formally enters Trump's Board of Peace after signing charter</strong></a><br><p>

Last year, the Sindh government had decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. The system was officially inaugurated in October and drew a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
According to a press release issued from the office of Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Javed Akhtar Odho, in a meeting held at the Central Police Office Karachi today, the newly appointed IG reviewed the performance of the new traffic system.
During the meeting, the deputy inspector general of traffic police briefed Odho that “so far, over 288,000 e-tickets have been generated under TRACS,” out of which 52 per cent of the tickets had been delivered, while 48pc were still under process.
The IGP was informed that the “reason for the delay in delivery was due to refusal to accept tickets, change of address or incomplete address,” and that redelivery was underway.
The IGP was further briefed that 71 percent of the tickets issued had been paid by citizens, while a significant percentage were waived as they were first-time offences.
“So far, 7,681 complaints have been registered against the e-challan system, out of which 81pc have been resolved and another 19pc are under review,” according to the briefing.
It further emerged that 12,000 vehicles have been blacklisted under the ticketing system since October 27.
The IGP was briefed that under the new system, vehicles associated with “non-transfer of ownership rights, fake number plates, incomplete number plates, theft, mischief,” and other illegal activities have been blacklisted.
IGP Odho also “directed traffic police to work in collaboration with district police to take action against the blacklisted vehicles,” the press release said.
He also issued instructions that the data of blacklisted vehicles should be provided to Safe City cameras, Emergency Response Vehicles and the Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell.
“Additional IG Karachi, prepare a comprehensive plan for action against blacklisted vehicles,” IGP Odho said.
The statement added that he also directed traffic police to issue e-tickets through smartphones on an experimental basis.
He termed the use of technology essential to modern policing, adding that the “extraordinary steps need to be taken to make policing simpler”.
During the meeting, it was also decided to impose a Rs100,000 fine on heavy vehicles without trackers.
IGP Odho also issued instructions to the traffic police to ban transfers in the department.</p><small>2026-01-22 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646558-winter-showers-lash-parts-of-karachi-amid-strong-winds' target='_blank'><strong>Winter showers lash parts of Karachi amid strong winds</strong></a><br><p>

The information came to light in a PTA report, seen by Dawn and submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today in relation to a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in his name.
The report stated that the first request was sent on August 21, 2022, to X, and the body received no response from the social media platform.
On April 18, 2024, PTA submitted another request for the blocking of Imran’s account via email.
The report said that the email included “citation of relevant court orders against Imran and details of his conviction and sentence to 14, 10, and seven years in Toshakhana, cypher, and unlawful marriage cases”.
However, it added that once again, no response was received from X.
The report added that on November 27, 2025, PTA wrote to the platform seeking the blocking of 47 tweets from Imran’s X account.
However, out of the 47, X only blocked one tweet.
PTA, in its report, also noted that the over-the-top (OTT) services operating in Pakistan were not regulated as they were registered in their country of origin.
It added that the companies “are not necessarily bound by the region/country in which the user is accessing their content”.
It also took note of the fact that “content management, social media operators do provide an official channel to the users as well as the regulators to lodge their complaints”.
The authority said that the “other option remains to block the internet traffic flowing to these operations, however, since they utilise secure channels, selective blocking on their content cannot be enabled.”
“But complete access to their services can be revoked on a best effort basis,” it added.
The authority added that in October 2021, PTA had requested social media companies to comply with Section 7 (6) of the Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules and register themselves with PTA and “appoint a local compliance grievance officer”.
“However, no affirmative response has been received to date,” it added.
On Wednesday, the IHC took up the petition regarding the X account and questioned how proceedings in the case could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him.
During yesterday’s proceedings, the court told the PTA counsel that the authority’s response to the petition was “unsatisfactory”.
In September last year, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail premises.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646529-when-principle-meets-realpolitik-pakistan-and-the-peace-board' target='_blank'><strong>When principle meets realpolitik: Pakistan and the peace board</strong></a><br><p>

The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle.
On Wednesday he announced a “framework” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations.
“I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.
“They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”

 


It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes.
After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”
“No he didn’t, Libby. His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here,” Leavitt fired back on X, misspelling the journalist’s name.







During his speech at Davos, Trump, as he often does, frequently strayed from the written script scrolling on the teleprompters.
Asked about the events in Davos, Gavin Newsom, California’s Democratic governor and a leading opposition figure in the United States who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, seized on the moment.
“None of this is normal,” Newsom said. “There’s a normalisation, a deviancy of consciousness.”
Sensitive subject
The issue of mental acuity is a sensitive one for Trump.
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he attacked incumbent Joe Biden, claiming the Democrat suffered from dementia.
In recent days, some Democratic lawmakers have called for invoking the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for removing a president who no longer has the physical or intellectual capacity to carry out the duties of office.
The politicians justified their calls by citing a message that Trump had sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
In the message, made public on Monday, Trump expressed his displeasure with not being awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump also reiterated his desire for the US to take control of Greenland.
“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote.
However, an independent committee — not the Norwegian government — is the body that awards the peace prize and other Nobel prizes at an annual ceremony in Oslo.</p><small>2026-01-22 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646518-sindh-governor-tessori-pledges-financial-support-for-imran-farooqs-sons' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh Governor Tessori pledges financial support for Imran Farooq's sons</strong></a><br><p>
