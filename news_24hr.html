The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday.
He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough.
Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down.
“The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties.
He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”.
In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.
“If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to.
‘Outright rejected negotiations’
Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations.
“We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government.
“The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said.
In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.”
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-01 20:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/012213071033369.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964488/puc-chairman-tahir-ashrafi-appointed-liaison-for-religious-harmony-pakistani-diaspora-in-muslim-countries' target='_blank'><strong>PUC Chairman Tahir Ashrafi appointed liaison for religious harmony, Pakistani diaspora in Muslim countries</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday appointed Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) Chairman Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi as the Coordinator for Religious Harmony and for the Pakistani Diaspora in the Middle East and Muslim Countries.
The PUC is a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought.
Ashrafi, also a member of the Supreme Council of the Muslim World League and other Islamic organisations, has been given the appointment at a critical time, given the evolving situation in the Muslim world and the strategic importance of relations with the Gulf nations and other Islamic countries.
Talking to Dawn, he said that under the new role, he will be responsible for strengthening coordination, enhancing mutual understanding and further improving Pakistan’s relations with Islamic and Arab states, mainly the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
“This is because I have maintained close and longstanding ties with leading Islamic scholars and senior leaders of the Arab and Muslim world,” Ashrafi said, adding, “And the reason for this close coordination is that I always talk about the issues and the problems faced by Pakistan are similar to those faced by other Muslim countries.”
“We face terror in the form of the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and the Arab countries face terror threats from Daesh (Islamic State); we need to have a collective stance against terror groups – this is the need of the time to counter the image problem faced by the Muslim world in the West,“ he added
His appointment reflects the government’s commitment to advancing religious harmony locally and advancing constructive engagement with the Muslim world to counter extremism, as well as enhancing Pakistan’s non-commercial role in the Middle East.
Ashrafi has held similar positions in past governments; he previously served as a special representative and brings extensive experience in religious diplomacy, interfaith engagement and international outreach.</p><small>2026-01-01 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0121512448986b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964486/govt-should-have-shown-a-big-heart-pti-leaders-again-denied-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Govt should have shown a big heart’: PTI leaders again denied meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>PTI leaders were once again denied a meeting with incarcerated party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday, as party leaders lamented the restrictions and said the government should have “shown a big heart”.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. The party has staged sit-ins near the prison to demand a meeting with the party founder, with one earlier this week dispersed with water cannons.
“I was hoping that, considering the offer of talks by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the first day of the new year, the government would allow us to meet PTI’s founding chairman,“ said Muhammad Jamal Khan, a member of the National Assembly (MNA) while talking to Dawn.
“It could have been the first step towards creating national harmony and ending the tense political environment, but the government lost that chance.”
On Wednesday, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja had written a letter to the Superintendent at Adiala jail — where Imran is imprisoned — and shared the names of six people for a meeting with the party founder. The names included Dr Amjad Ali, Sahibzada Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Iqbal Khattak, Shoaib Ameer Awan and Muhammad Jamal Khan.
The MNA said he approached the gate of Adiala jail at 2:30 pm and informed the jail staff that his name had been forwarded by Raja for the meeting.
“The officials told me that they had noted my name and suggested I return to the check post and wait, where media personnel were also standing,” Jamal added.
“They told me that I would be informed if they got the approval for the meeting. I waited there until 4:40 pm, but they kept telling me that they had not received approval to let me in.”
When asked why only two people arrived outside Adiala jail, despite the prison administrators having received six names, Jamal said that he and Member of the Provincial Assembly Iqbal Khan Khattak had arrived at the prison together.
“There is a possibility that other leaders might have been elsewhere at Adiala jail. I did not have their contact numbers, so I cannot confirm whether they had arrived or not,” he added.
Replying to a question, Jamal said that the government had shown weakness.
“It should have allowed the meeting to signal that it is serious about negotiations, and the nation would have seen it as a positive message from the government,” he added.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
A sit-in staged by PTI leaders and the sisters of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan was once again dispersed using water cannons late on Tuesday night.</p><small>2026-01-01 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0113431331c89c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964459/dozens-killed-100-injured-in-fire-at-swiss-ski-resort-bar-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Dozens killed, 100 injured in fire at Swiss ski resort bar, police say</strong></a><br><p>Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured, most of them seriously, after fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year’s Eve party in the upscale Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, officials said on Thursday.
Fire broke out at 1.30am in a bar called “Le Constellation” in the resort in southwestern Switzerland, which locals said was popular with teenagers. The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, remains unclear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.
Swiss police said “tens” of people were presumed dead, with around 100 injured, and the Italian foreign ministry said information from Swiss police indicated about 40 deaths. Swiss officials declined to give a specific figure.

“There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,” said 21-year-old local Samuel Rapp, who saw the aftermath of the fire. “They had jackets over their faces, thats what I saw, nothing more.”
Ceiling caught fire
Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.
Two young French women who said they were in the bar told France’s BFM TV that they saw the fire start in the basement section of the club after a bottle containing “birthday candles” was held up too close to the wooden ceiling.
“The fire spread across the ceiling super quickly,” one of the two women, who identified themselves as Emma and Albane, told BFM TV. The pair said they were able to climb a narrow staircase to the ground floor and escape the building. Minutes later, the fire had reached the ground floor too, they said.

BFM showed video of a waitress carrying a champagne bottle with a lit ‘fountain candle’ through the bar, in line with the account, but the video did not show the fire taking hold.
Video footage verified by Reuters showed fire spreading from the building, with people outside the club, some of them running and screaming.
Victims come from several countries
Italy’s ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told Sky TG24 local authorities had told him the blaze was started by someone letting off a firework inside the bar which set fire to the ceiling. He was in Crans-Montana, where he said a number of Italians had gathered seeking information about missing relatives or friends.
He declined to say if there were any Italian victims but witnesses said many of those in the bar appeared to be from other countries.
Witnesses described the injured being treated in improvised triage centres set up in a nearby bar and in a branch of UBS bank and said many suffered after coming out of the heat of the bar into the freezing night air.
“And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible,” said Dominic Dubois, who witnessed the frantic scenes as the bodies were brought out.

A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said that first responders approached staff overnight asking for table cloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.
On Thursday morning, hours after the explosion, footage from the street outside showed the area cordoned off, with forensic tents behind white screens set up in front of the bar, one of many in Crans-Montana, a fashionable ski centre with an array of boutiques, luxury hotels and restaurants.
“I know someone who might have been among the victims and I can’t reach her. I’m very worried,” said local resident Karine Spreng. “I’m going to try to contact other people who know this woman to see if she is still alive.”
The daytime scene, with small groups of people, some in tears or carrying flowers, was a stark contrast to the panic and confusion that officials said faced first responders who arrived when the alarm was raised.
“The first responders - the firefighters and police officers - arrived at a scene of chaos, at a dramatic scene,” Stephane Ganzer, head of security for Valais canton, told reporters.
He said some of the victims were from other countries, hundreds of personnel were working on the case and a helpline had been opened for relatives. Officials said the grim task of identifying badly burned bodies would take a considerable time.
“I can’t hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,” the canton’s head of police, Frederic Gisler, told the press conference.
“Our count is about 100 injured, most seriously, and unfortunately tens of people are presumed dead,” he said, adding that patients had been dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
Local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said a full investigation had been opened into the incident at the bar, which Swiss company records indicated was owned by a French couple.
“At the moment we are considering this a fire and we are not considering the possibility of an attack,” she told a press conference.
Mourning
Swiss Federal President Guy Parmelin expressed shock at the scale of the disaster, which came less than a year after a fire in a club in North Macedonia killed 59 people.
“What was meant to be a moment of joy turned, on the first day of the year in Crans-Montana, into mourning that touches the entire country and far beyond,” he said on the social media platform X, expressing condolences.
The foreign ministers of neighbouring Italy and Germany and other countries including the United States expressed condolences but there was no immediate confirmation of the nationality of any of the victims.
Prosecutor Pilloud said authorities were trying to get the bodies of the victims to their families.
“A lot of resources have been put into forensics to identify the victims. These resources are intended to allow us to get the bodies to the families as soon as possible,” she said.
Earlier, police said many people were being treated for burns and that the area had been completely closed off, with a no-fly zone imposed over Crans-Montana, which is due to host next year’s Alpine World Ski Championships. Authorities said 10 helicopters and 40 ambulances had been deployed.







President Zardari, PM Shehbaz extend condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari said he was deeply saddened over the incident and extended condolences to the families of the victims and wished the injured a swift recovery.
In a social media post on X, the president said he was “heartbroken by news of the devastating explosion & fire in Crans-Montanaon, Switzerland on New Year’s night“.

Station House Officer (SHO) Ghulam Ali Abro, posted in Sibi, told Dawn that the incident was a grenade attack which occurred at 7:05pm.
“One person expired and five others were injured,” the SHO said. “Security forces and Edhi ambulances arrived on the scene as soon as they received reports about the incident.”
He further told reporters at the site of the attack that six injured people were transported to a hospital, with one of them succumbing to their injuries on the way.
Meanwhile, Sibi region Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Barkat Khosa told Dawn that the injured were moved to the Teaching Hospital, while the body of the deceased was handed over to his heirs.
“Police have tightened security in the area, and further investigation is underway,” DIG Khosa said.
Last month, an eight-year-old child was killed and five other members of a family, including two women, were injured when a grenade exploded inside a house in the Wadh area of Balochistan’s Khuzdar district.
Police said two families from Sindh’s Kashmore district were in the house when unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade into the courtyard. It exploded, killing the child on the spot.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, 2025 was recorded as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, a report from the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) think tank stated.
The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials rising almost 38 per cent in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024 and 34pc in 2025.</p><small>2026-01-01 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01201607b48fed0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964483/punjab-bar-suspends-licence-of-lawyer-representing-tiktoker-rajab-butt' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab bar suspends licence of lawyer representing TikToker Rajab Butt</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq for representing TikToker Rajab Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the local bar.
The strike had been called in protest against the alleged victimisation of the Karachi Bar Association’s former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. During the strike, judicial proceedings were strictly prohibited within the city courts’ premises.
According to an order issued by PbBC Executive Committee’s Chairman Zabiullah Nagra, the action was taken after receiving a letter from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association.
The letter drew the council’s attention to a “video circulating on social media in which Advocate Ashfaq was seen appearing before the Karachi City Courts while representing TikToker Rajab Butt during an ongoing lawyers’ strike,” said Nagra.
“It further observed that the advocate appeared before the courts despite the strike, allegedly accompanied by private guards or individuals in clear violation of the strike restrictions and the established canons of the legal profession,” the order stated.
It further noted that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”.
“These remarks reportedly caused divisions within the legal fraternity, leading to confrontation and discord among lawyers,” it added.
As per the order, Advocate Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.
Examining his professional record, the order said that Advocate Ashfaq was registered as an advocate with the PbBC in 2010 and the high court in 2012.
“As a practising lawyer,” the council asserted that Advocate Ashfaq was “duty bound to uphold the dignity and high standing of the legal profession at all times”.
“The executive committee unanimously decided to suspend Advocate Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect,” it said.
The committee also referred the matter to the disciplinary committee of the council for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation of the licence in accordance with law.
Talking to Dawn, Nagra said the PbBC, as a statutory regulatory body, was not required to issue a prior notice before suspending a lawyer’s licence in cases involving professional misconduct.
“Every enrolled advocate is presumed to have full knowledge of the code of conduct prescribed under the Bar Council rules and is duty-bound to comply with it,” he said.
Council’s executive committee chairman added that the lawyer concerned had been found involved in activities “unbecoming of a member of the legal profession” for quite some time.
On Monday, YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
The hearing, during which the Youtuber was represented by Ashfaq, was marred by violence and chaos.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-01 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0113565387876c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964467/are-you-ready-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-says-he-will-visit-karachi-on-january-9' target='_blank'><strong>‘Are you ready?’: KP CM Sohail Afridi says he will visit Karachi on January 9</strong></a><br><p>Days after concluding a three-day visit to Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced on Thursday that he will visit Karachi on January 9.
“Friday, January 9!” the chief minister said on social media platform X. “Karachi, Sindh, are you ready?”
Afridi said he would be coming to Karachi “bearing Imran Khan’s message”, adding that he would be meeting “all friends of the party”.







Afridi had previously announced that Karachi was his next destination for galvanising party supporters.
During his visit to Lahore, the KP CM had attempted to deliver a speech to supporters at Liberty Chowk but was unable to do so as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets.
He had also addressed PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, a visit that was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
He was also barred from visiting the cantonment to meet party leaders, as well as the food street that had been shut down ahead of his visit. He also went to Zaman Park amid heavy police deployment, while the detention of party supporters during the tour was also reported.
On Monday, he wrote to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to complain about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. He maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”.
He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”.
The KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, exce­ssive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”. He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government” and stressed that it damaged the “collective credibility of federating units”.
Separately, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan said the KP CM’s visit to the provincial assembly would be investigated by the law enforcement agencies in light of the CCTV footage and the initial inquiry report.</p><small>2026-01-01 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01194623d0f29a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964482/several-reported-killed-in-iran-protests-over-economic-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Several reported killed in Iran protests over economic woes</strong></a><br><p>Several people were reportedly killed during unrest in Iran on Thursday, an Iranian news agency and a rights group reported, as the biggest protests to hit the country for three years over soaring inflation sparked violence in several provinces.
The semi-official Fars news agency cited a “source with knowledge” as saying several people were killed in clashes on Thursday morning between police and what it said were armed protesters in Lordegan in western Iran.
The rights group, Hengaw, also reported deaths in Lordegan.
Violence reported in several cities
Thursday’s clashes in Lordegan, along with reported deaths of a security services member overnight and another protester on Wednesday, mark an escalation in the unrest since shopkeepers began protesting on Sunday.
The Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday morning a member of its affiliated Basij volunteer paramilitary unit had been killed in the western city of Kuhdasht, naming him as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard. Thirteen other militiamen were wounded, it added.
Hengaw reported that a protester was also killed on Wednesday in Isfahan province in central Iran.
Reuters could not immediately verify any of those reports.
Tehran has responded to the unrest with an offer of dialogue, an apparently conciliatory gesture alongside its security response.
Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Thursday that the authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trades unions and merchants, but without giving details.
Merchants, shop owners and students in a number of Iranian universities have been demonstrating for days and closing major bazaars. The government shut down much of the country on Wednesday by declaring a holiday due to cold weather.
However, President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he had asked the interior minister to listen to “legitimate demands” of the demonstrators.
Iran’s economy has been struggling for years as a result of US and Western sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear program. Regional tensions led to a 12-day air war with Israel in June, further straining the country’s finances.
The Iranian rial lost around half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December.</p><small>2026-01-01 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/011838353e1963b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964481/household-integrated-economic-survey-shows-57pc-surge-in-internet-users-across-pakistan-as-access-reaches-70pc-of-homes' target='_blank'><strong>Household Integrated Economic Survey shows 57pc surge in internet users across Pakistan as access reaches 70pc of homes</strong></a><br><p>Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) 2024–25 on Thursday revealed the surge of up to 57 per cent in the individual internet users in Pakistan as household internet access rate increased from 34pc to 70pc.
HIES — a yearly survey — conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) is focused on social and economic conditions of the country to provide data for policy making at the national and provincial levels.
The PBS released the results of HIES during a ceremony at the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Islamabad, today.
“The PBS has successfully completed and released the results of the Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) 2024–25, marking a major milestone in Pakistan’s national data ecosystem,“ a statement from the Press Information Department (PID) said.
It further said that “the survey provides comprehensive insights to review the social and economic conditions of the country and serves as a key tool for evidence-based planning and policymaking.”
PID said that “HIES 2024–25 is the First-Ever Fully Digital HIES conducted after Digital Population and Housing Census 2023.”
“Field operation of the survey was completed in June 2025 by conducting on a quarterly basis, covering 32,000 households across Pakistan, representative at the provincial and national level,” said PID.
“A fully integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system was used for data collection, task management and real-time monitoring.”
Key highlights
As per the key results and major highlights of the survey released by PBS, there was an increase from 17pc to 57pc in the number of individuals using the internet in Pakistan.
It also said the household mobile or smartphone facility was increased to 96pc. Furthermore, household internet access increased from 34pc to 70pc.
PBS said that the gender parity at the primary level saw a rise from 92pc to 96pc in Pakistan.
According to the survey results, the neonatal mortality rate declined from 41 to 35 per thousand live births. Moreover, the infant mortality rate decreased from 60 to 47 per thousand live births, and the total fertility rate also decreased from 3.7 to 3.6 children per woman.
The survey said the use of clean fuels—such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, biogas, solar energy, and electricity for clean heating, lighting, and cooking—surged to 38pc.
PBS mentioned that household income and consumption increased to Rs82,179 and Rs79,150, respectively, in Pakistan.
It said that the major part of the household consumption goes to food (37pc), housing and fuel (26pc), followed by restaurants and hotels (6.63pc), clothing and footwear (6.28pc) and transport (6.21pc) at the national level.
Pakistan Panel Household Survey 2024 had earlier revealed that only 19.5pc of households can always afford desired meals, while 30pc sometimes go without three meals a day.
‘Major milestone for policymaking’
Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed the survey as a “major milestone towards data-driven governance and evidence-based policymaking”.
Addressing the launch ceremony, Iqbal said the Ministry of Planning had assumed ownership of clearing long-pending statistical backlogs and had completed surveys that remained stalled for six to seven years.
Ahsan Iqbal said the availability of updated data would strengthen government policymaking while enabling researchers, businesses and youth to undertake better research, business planning and national analysis. “This survey is a milestone for the country,” he remarked.
Referring to the findings of HIES, the minister said Pakistan had faced a series of economic shocks over the past six to seven years, beginning with policy disruptions after 2018 that derailed the growth momentum built between 2013 and 2018.
He said mismanagement, particularly the surge in imports in 2022 to around $80 billion, resulted in a massive current account deficit and depletion of foreign exchange reserves, causing currency instability and prolonged inflation.
“There was no economic plan or direction; only reactive measures, and retaliatory measures do not run an economy,” he said, adding that the situation was exacerbated by Covid-19 and subsequent global commodity and supply shocks.
The minister said the survey showed the lower middle class had been the most affected, with sharp changes in income and consumption patterns. “Food inflation and rising utility prices consumed most of their income, leaving little room for other expenses,” he said.
Despite the turbulence, Ahsan Iqbal said the economy had now moved past the worst phase and was on a recovery path.
Iqbal cited GDP growth of 3.71pc in the first quarter as “very encouraging” and expressed optimism that growth could reach 4pc or higher if the current trajectory was maintained.
However, he cautioned against artificial, consumption-led growth driven by excessive imports. “We do not want short-lived growth that crashes due to foreign exchange shortages,” he said, stressing the need to align growth with export earnings, remittances, foreign direct investment and other inflows.
Iqbal said the government was pursuing a prudent growth policy alongside reforms under the IMF programme to ensure stability and sustained high growth in the coming years.
On social indicators, the minister acknowledged relative improvements in literacy, health and infant mortality but said progress remained insufficient.
He pointed out that literacy had risen only from around 60 to 63 per cent, far short of global benchmarks.
“Under an education emergency, we must raise literacy to 90 per cent in the next five to six years,” he said, calling for joint efforts by governments, civil society and individuals.
Highlighting the Uraan Pakistan agenda, Iqbal said the survey reinforced the urgency of accelerating socio-economic development while ensuring peace and stability.
He urged a shift in national discourse from political confrontation to issues shaping the country’s future, such as child stunting, literacy and universal primary enrolment.
“The future belongs to nations that prioritise their economy and socio-economic development,” he said, adding that strong socio-economic foundations were essential for political stability.
The minister called upon the media, opposition, private sector and civil society to use the survey as a basis for constructive debate and collaboration. “We can only achieve our goals through cooperation as Team Pakistan,” he said.
Describing the HIES as “an invitation to think and act,” he reiterated the resolve to transform Pakistan’s social and economic indicators under Uraan Pakistan, while achieving a $1 trillion economy by 2035.
Uraan Pakistan is a five-year National Eco­nomic Transforma­tion Plan launched in 2024, focused on the revival of the country’s economy through targeted measures.</p><small>2026-01-01 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642686-27th-amendment-pti-seeks-disqualification-of-senator-saifullah-abro-for-defection' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: PTI seeks disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for defection</strong></a><br><p>

Under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Atta­cks against Nuclear Insta­llations and Facilities, signed on December 31, 1988, both countries committed to annually share information about their nuclear installations and facilities. The agreement took effect from Jan 27, 1991, and the annual exchange has been taking place on the first day of every year since 1992.







In continuation of the practice, the exchange took place today as well, Andrabi said during the FO’s weekly briefing.
“A list of nuclear installations and facilities in Pakistan was officially handed over to the representative of the Indian High Commission in the Foreign Office today.
“I understand that the Indian government is also sharing the list of Indian nuclear installations with our High Commission in New Delhi today,” he said.
The FO spokesperson further noted that the 1988 “agreement provides that both countries shall inform each other of their nuclear installations and facilities“.
Moreover, the two countries had “exchanged a list of prisoners as well“, he said.
“The Indian government is also sharing the list of Pakistani prisoners in their custody with the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi,” he added.
Separately, the FO detailed in a statement that today, Pakistan handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civil and 199 fishermen) to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.







In pursuance of the Agreement on Consular Access, 2008, both sides are required to share the lists of prisoners in each other’s custody on January 1 and July 1, every year.
‘India should urgently return to treaty compliance’
Andrabi also addressed India’s recent activity regarding hydroelectric projects, and said that under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India could not misuse its restricted allowance for unilaterally building any hydroelectric projects on the western rivers.
He made these remarks while responding to a question about India’s approval of the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir.
The IWT is a water-distribution agreement between India and Pakistan, brokered by the World Bank and was signed in Karachi on Sept 19, 1960 by President Ayub Khan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The treaty gives India complete rights to waters of the eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) and gives Pakistan the rights over the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum and Chenab) with limited allowance for use of water by India from the western rivers for purposes of, among others, power generation.
In his remarks, Andrabi said, “We have seen these media reports regarding Indian plans to construct the Dulhasti Stage-II hydroelectric [project] on the Chenab River. Obviously, these reports raise serious concerns as no prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project.”
He further said that sharing of this information was mandated by the IWT.
“Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law and bilateral treaties. The Pakistani commissioner for Indus water has sought clarification from his counterpart in India regarding the nature, scope and technical details of the reported projects, and he also wishes to ascertain whether this constitutes a new run-of-the-river project, an alteration or additional work on an existing plant,“ he said.
He said that under the IWT, India could not misuse its “restricted allowance” for unilaterally building any hydroelectric projects on the western rivers.
“Any such project on the western river is subject to strict design and operational controls as well as information sharing requirements,” he said.
“In the absence of formal communication from the Indian side, Pakistan is unable to access the project’s conformity with the treaty provisions. We, therefore, call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus water commissioner in his latest as well as his earlier communications.“
He said that Pakistan reiterated that IWT remained a binding international agreement. He said that Pakistan remained committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes with India but would “never compromise on our existential water rights”.
‘Pakistan stands with China in all its core interests, including Taiwan’
In response to a question about the recent US arms sales to Taiwan, Andrabi said that Pakistan has “consistently supported China, in all matters of its core interests, including Taiwan”.
He stressed that Pakistan will continue to “adhere to the One-China principle and in that way, we regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China”.

 

“We would urge all relevant countries to abide by their historical commitments, take steps to foster peace, security and development in Taiwan,” he said.
He further stated: “We would also urge them to refrain from measures that may aggravate tensions or undermine peace and stability in the region”.
The FO spokesperson also recalled that “during a press briefing of the foreign minister on Saturday, a few colleagues had asked about the issue of stranded Pakistani nationals in Afghanistan due to border closure”.
Addressing the issue, he said that “15 students and another 291 individuals had safely returned to Pakistan”.
“We are in contact with the Afghan authorities,” he added.
“You may note that a total of 1,199 Pakistanis approached our embassy in Kabul seeking assistance for their return; these include 549 students and 402 [other] individuals,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-01 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01165453583d61d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964478/128-journalists-killed-worldwide-in-2025-press-group' target='_blank'><strong>128 journalists killed worldwide in 2025: press group</strong></a><br><p>A total of 128 journalists were killed around the world in 2025, more than half of them in the Middle East, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said on Thursday.
The grim toll, up from 2024, “is not just a statistic, it’s a global red alert for our colleagues,” IFJ general secretary Anthony Bellanger told AFP.
The press group voiced particular alarm over the situation in the Palestinian territories, where it recorded 56 media professionals killed in 2025 as Israel’s war with Hamas ground on in Gaza.
“We’ve never seen anything like this: so many deaths in such a short time, in such a small area,” Bellanger said.
Journalists were also killed in Yemen, Ukraine, Sudan, Peru, India and elsewhere.
Bellanger condemned what he called “impunity” for those behind the attacks.
“Without justice, it allows the killers of journalists to thrive,” he warned.
Meanwhile, the IFJ said that across the globe, 533 journalists were currently in prison – a figure that has more than doubled over the past half-decade.
China once again topped the list as the worst jailer of reporters with 143 behind bars, including in Hong Kong, where authorities have been criticised by Western nations for imposing national security laws quashing dissent.
The IFJ’s count for the number of journalists killed is typically far higher than that of Reporters Without Borders, due to different counting methods. This year’s IFJ toll also included nine accidental deaths.
Reporters Without Borders said 67 journalists were killed in the course of their work this year.
It said in the report that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by Israeli forces in Gaza.
In Pakistan, the Pakistan Press Foundation documented at least 137 confirmed incidents targeting journalists and media professionals in 2025, including eight killings.
It also reported 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids.</p><small>2026-01-01 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01163805ce00d78.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964479/446-lawmakers-fail-to-submit-asset-statements-ecp-issues-revised-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>446 lawmakers fail to submit asset statements; ECP issues revised deadline</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday said 446 lawmakers — including 125 members of the National Assembly — failed to submit their statements of assets and liabilities with the ECP by the due date — set at December 31.
In a press release issued today, ECP notified the lawmakers who had missed the earlier deadline to submit their statements by January 15, and said that “as many as 446 lawmakers failed to submit their statements of assets and liabilities” with the ECP by the due date.
Out of these, 125 lawmakers are members of the National Assembly, 26 Senators, 159 members of the Punjab Assembly, 62 members of the Sindh Assembly, 48 members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly and 26 members of the Balochistan Assembly.
The commission said that members of the parliament and provincial assemblies were required to submit a copy of a statement of assets and liabilities by Dec 31, including assets and liabilities of their dependents.
It stated that the submission was a mandatory requirement under Section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137 (1) of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that “every member of an assembly and senate shall submit to the Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a copy of his statement of assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of June on Form B.”
ECP directed lawmakers who had not yet complied to submit their statement by Jan 15 during office hours.
It warned that members who failed to do so will be suspended the next day, in accordance with Section 137 (3) of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137(3) pertains to the suspension of lawmakers who fail to comply with the deadline.
Last year, ECP suspended the membership of 139 lawmakers after they failed to submit their annual statements of assets.
Those suspended included two Senators from Balochistan, Muhammad Qasim of BNP and Abdul Quddus of PPP.
Other lawmakers included 16 members of the National Assembly, 68 of the Punjab Assembly, 33 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, 15 of the Sindh Assembly and five of the Balochistan Assembly.
The suspended lawmakers were barred from attending the respective legislature’s proceedings.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/011632278e97dbb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964476/cpi-inflation-slows-to-56pc-year-on-year-in-december' target='_blank'><strong>CPI inflation slows to 5.6pc year-on-year in December</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s consumer price inflation slowed to 5.6 per cent year-on-year in December, while prices fell every month, official data showed on Thursday.
The data comes after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.5pc last month, breaking a four-meeting hold, in a move that surprised markets. All analysts polled by Reuters had expected rates to remain unchanged at the December meeting.
Inflation eased from 6.1pc in November and marked a sharp slowdown from levels that peaked above 30pc in 2023, according to official data.
Lower prices of perishable food items helped drive the monthly decline, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said, with food prices falling 1.7pc month-on-month in December, led by declines in both urban and rural areas.
The finance ministry had said on Wednesday that inflation was expected to remain moderate at 5.5-6.5pc in December.
The SBP has said that inflation stayed within its 5-7pc target range during the July-November period, but warned that core inflation remains sticky and headline inflation could rise temporarily towards the end of this fiscal year, which ends in June, due to base effects.
Non-food inflation remained elevated in both urban and rural areas in December, underscoring the central bank’s concerns over persistent underlying price pressures.
The central bank has said the inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged, while the International Monetary Fund has cautioned against premature monetary easing under the $7 billion loan programme.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01140511501d1be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964469/pti-seeks-disqualification-of-senator-saifullah-abro-for-voting-in-favour-of-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI seeks disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for voting in favour of 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI submitted a reference to the Senate chairperson on Thursday, seeking the disqualification of Senator Saifullah Abro for defecting from party line and voting in favour of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
PTI Senator Ali Zafar posted about the development on his X account, saying: “Saifullah Abro went against party line by voting in favour of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, for which a reference for his disqualification has been filed.”







The reference, moved by Zafar, invoked Article 63-A of the Constitution, which deals with disqualification on grounds of defection.
“The declaration is being submitted for onward reference to the chief election commissioner for laying the same before the election commission in accordance with the said Article 63-A,” the reference, dated January 1 and seen by Dawn, said.
It added that a meeting of the PTI was convened before voting on the 27th Amendment, in which it was “explicitly decided and communicated to all PTI senators in writing” that they were to oppose and not vote in favour of any legislative measure or bill relating to the said amendment.
The direction to oppose and not vote in favour of any legislative measure relating to the 27th Amendment was also issued by Zafar to all PTI senators, including Abro, the reference stated, adding: “The record confirms that this direction was properly conveyed to him and that he was fully aware of it.”
The direction was also widely published in the media, the reference said.
However, Senator Abro voted in favour of the legislation first on November 10, 2025 — when the Senate first voted on the amendment — and then on November 13,2025 when the house considered the legislation for the second time after some changes were made to it, the reference said..
At both instances, Abro voted in favour of the amendment, contrary to the “clear, unanimous and duly communicated direction” of the PTI and his parliamentary leader in the Senate, it said.
The reference further stated that a show-cause notice dated December 2, 2025 was issued to Abro, and it was subsequently “received at his residential/official mailing addresses of Larkana and Islamabad, affording him full and adequate opportunity to show cause as to why a declaration may not be made against him in terms of Article 63-A”.
The show-cause notice was issued in compliance with the requirements of Article 63-A, the reference said, further stating that no reply or explanation was received from Senator Abro.
By voting against the direction issued by the PTI, Abro “committed a deliberate and wilful breach of party discipline“, the reference said.
The reference stated that after due consideration of the facts, the PTI, as well as its parliamentary leaders in the Senate, had concluded that the conduct of Senator Abro was “contrary to the direction issued by the PTI parliamentary party, which constitutes defection from the PTI”.
“Senator Saifullah Abro is, therefore, declared to have defected from the PTI in terms of Article 63-A.”
The PTI requested the Senate chairman to refer this declaration to the chief election commissioner “for laying it before the election commission for [a] decision in terms of Article 63-A”.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Senator Aon Abbas Buppi said, “We are sure that the [Senate] chairman is not going to forward this reference to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). So we are also filing a reference with the ECP.“
According to Article 63-A of the Constitution, after receiving a declaration of a member’s defection, the presiding officer of a House — the Senate chairperson in this case — shall refer it to the chief election commissioner within two days.
“In case he fails to do so, it shall be deemed that he has referred the declaration to the chief election commissioner who shall lay the declaration before the election commission for its decision thereon confirming the declaration or otherwise within 30 days of its receipt by the chief election commissioner,” the provision says.
If the ECP confirms the defection, the relevant member “shall cease to be a member of the house and his seat shall become vacant“, Article 63-A states, adding that any party aggrieved by the ECP’s decision may appeal it within 30 days in the Federal Constitutional Court.
The court shall then decide the matter within 90 days from the date of the filing of the appeal, it says.
Abro’s resignation
Apart from Abro, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Senator Ahmed Khan had also voted in favour of the 27th Amendment against party line on November 10.
While the JUI-F had expelled Khan after the vote, Abro had announced his announced his resignation as a senator on the floor of the House.
Speaking on the floor of the upper house, he said he had “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces had made the nation proud by winning against India in the May conflict.
“During the passage of the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue,” he had further stated.
After he announced that he was stepping down, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani had commented, “We will make you a senator again”.
Separately, during the Senate session on November 13, 2025, Gilani had said a verbal announcement of a resignation meant nothing in legal terms. “I will call him (Abro) when he submits his resignation in writing. Maybe I will succeed in convincing him not to resign,“ he had remarked.
No further development has been reported with regards to Abro submitting his resignation in writing.
A day after Abro announced his resignation, PTI Senator Zafar, while speaking to Dawn, had said: “I have issued instructions under Article 63A. He [Senator Abro] violated them and is disqualified accordingly.”
Replying to a question, he said the party had distanced itself from Senator Abro, who had been removed from all communication channels, including the parliamentary party’s WhatsApp group.
No decision by JUI-F yet
Meanwhile, the JUI-F, after expelling Senator Khan, said he had been asked to resign from his Senate seat. If he fails to do so, the JUI-F will approach the ECP for his disqualification, the party said.

When asked about this after today’s developments, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza told Dawn that the matter was still under consideration.
“The issue is, if we file a reference with the Senate chairman to de-seat Ahmed Khan from the upper house, there is a strong chance that the Senate chairperson will not take up our case and delay it.
“This will degrade our party position,“ he said.
He further stated that if the Senate chairman would refer the reference to the ECP, a “seat which is still in our name on paper will go to the PPP or PML-N”.
“We do not want to give undue benefit to the PPP or the PML-N this way,“ he said.</p><small>2026-01-01 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/011509126848b3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964302/the-year-of-gen-z' target='_blank'><strong>The year of Gen Z</strong></a><br><p>Every time I open my “For You” feed on Instagram, I’m ushered into a parallel classroom: informal, intimate, and oddly generous. Young girls and boys who look my age and live inside the same algorithmic present lean into their cameras, handing me bite-sized context to systemic injustices, climate disasters, and political upheavals.
One tells me why women stay in abusive relationships long after the myth of “choice” collapses, unpacking trauma bonds and survival instincts with the precision of a psychology lecture delivered from a bedroom floor. Another explains the systematic oppression of women in Afghanistan and how bans on their work, movement, and education have collapsed into sanctioned violence, compressing years of repression into three lucid minutes of a GRWM (get ready with me) reel.
I first learned the language of geopolitics and settler colonialism here as a lived, continuous process instead of an abstract academic concept. Someone casually recommended ‘Decolonisation is not a metaphor’ by Eve Tuck — a paper that entirely reorganised how I understand land, justice, and the limits of liberal empathy. These, for lack of a better word, ‘Gen Z influencers’ speak as interlocutors, inviting me into analysis rather than performing it at me.
As they translate dense theory, buried histories, and ongoing atrocities into language that is undiluted and travels far, they prove that authority no longer rests with legacy media outlets but in the ability to bridge the personal and the political.
While history has often only recognised generations after they have altered the course of things, 2025 hints at a time when recognition and impact arrived simultaneously.
This year, across continents, youth-led movements shared neither language nor ideology, yet converged in one unmistakable way: acts of resistance. Gen Z presented itself as a digital subculture, and more importantly, a political force willing to rupture the present to reclaim a future systematically denied to it.
Collapse of patience
In Nepal, the draconian ban on 26 social media platforms was the final miscalculation of a ruling government that underestimated the power of a digitally mobilised generation. Officially framed as a tax-enforcement measure, the ban was understood as an attempt to suffocate dissent, particularly a viral, youth-led “nepo-kid” campaign that exposed the extravagant lives of politicians’ children against the material hardships confronting most young Nepalese: unemployment and forced migration.
Protests soon engulfed Kathmandu, and the parliament building was set ablaze. It was a symbolic indictment of a political class that had insulated itself from accountability. The prime minister’s resignation and the formation of an interim government followed, signalling a generational rupture with the long-held belief that political power in Nepal was beyond challenge.
Madagascar followed a parallel arc. What began as frustration over chronic water and electricity outages quickly became an uprising against corruption and state failure. Organised largely through social media, young protesters mobilised without traditional party leadership. Tensions were further inflamed by President Andry Rajoelina’s attempt to use large-scale urban infrastructure projects as a means of consolidating power.
The movement met with curfews, clashes, and repression, yet it succeeded in toppling the government. Madagascar’s Gen Z proved that networked protest can transform survival grievances into a systemic critique, capable of reshaping the very contours of national politics.
Digital mobilisation
What distinguished 2025 from earlier cycles of unrest was infrastructure: Gen Z repurposed social media as a powerful political tool. In Morocco, a wave of youth-led contestation emerged under the banner of “Gen Z 212” (named after the country’s international dialling code). Sparked by public outrage following a series of maternal deaths in Agadir on September 14, the movement quickly scaled into a nationwide challenge to long-standing structural grievances, demanding quality public healthcare and education, an end to corruption, and a dignified life.
The movement was coordinated through Discord, transforming what is typically a gaming platform into a decentralised command centre. Members shared protest routes, synchronised demonstrations, and documented arrests in real time while evading state surveillance. The Moroccan state, accustomed to tracking dissent through conventional channels, found itself reacting to a form of politics that moved faster than repression. In doing so, Gen Z 212 epitomised a mode of political agency rooted in generational values and enabled by digital infrastructures beyond traditional hierarchies.

 

This pattern repeated elsewhere. In Indonesia, online dissent spilt onto the streets, sparked clashes with police, and tragically, even led to deaths. Nationwide protests under the “Dark Indonesia” (#IndonesiaGelap) movement initially erupted in response to government budget cuts that threatened to raise tuition fees and eliminate scholarships. These demonstrations expanded to broader demands, including the removal of military officials from civilian bureaucratic positions and opposition to revisions of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) bill, which many feared could herald a return of authoritarianism. A parallel digital movement, #KaburAjaDulu (“Just Flee First”), captured young Indonesians’ anxiety about their future, encouraging migration for work and study.
The protests reached a tragic tipping point when 21-year-old driver Affan Kurniawan was killed by a police vehicle in Jakarta, catalysing demonstrations across major cities. Young activists leveraged social media to amplify Affan’s story, galvanise street protests, and exert pressure on authorities, yielding tangible outcomes such as the suspension of lawmakers’ controversial housing allowances. The movement revealed a generation unwilling to accept economic inequality, low wages, and a politically disconnected government.
Without a leader, with a direction
The movements of 2025 were largely leaderless, reflecting a profound scepticism toward traditional political parties and older generations in power perceived as corrupt or out of touch with youth anxieties. A defining feature of these uprisings was their deliberate refusal to elevate singular leaders. To older political commentators, this absence was framed as a weakness. When, in fact, it was actually a calculated strategy, guiding a new kind of political action.
Gen Z has grown up watching movements co-opted, leaders jailed or assassinated, and revolutions reduced to photo-ops. Their distrust of hierarchy is not naïveté; it is historical learning. In Peru, at least 19 people were injured during protests against the government of Peruvian President Dina Boluarte and Congress. Hundreds of people marched toward government seats in central Lima under heavy police presence, with groups of young protesters throwing stones, petrol bombs, and fireworks, while law enforcement responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.

 

The online and offline dimensions of the protest together exemplify decentralised activism: participants acted autonomously yet in alignment with a common direction, responding to unfolding events while maintaining focus on systemic change.
This leaderlessness unnerved political establishments. Who do you negotiate with when the movement is a network? Who do you arrest when outrage is distributed?
Housing allowances for lawmakers in Indonesia, World Cup spending in Morocco, pension reforms in Peru, each symbolised the same insult: money exists, but not for you. For a generation facing precarious work, unaffordable housing, climate anxiety, and the slow erosion of social contracts, this was intolerable. Gen Z changemakers are not merely seeking to replace one elite with another; they are here to alter the terms of legitimacy itself.
One generation, many frontlines
In 2025, Greta Thunberg yet again exemplified why she remains one of the most influential voices of her generation. No longer confined to climate activism alone, she broadened her focus to global human rights and humanitarian crises. This year, she joined two Gaza aid flotillas — actions that resulted in her detention and deportation by Israeli authorities — speaking about the mistreatment of Palestinians and demanding concrete international intervention without an ounce of fear. She also accepted the Right Livelihood Award on behalf of Myanmar’s Justice for Myanmar (JFM), using the platform to challenge the junta’s funding networks and highlight the broader implications of oppression worldwide.
Greta’s evolution from climate campaigner to a vocal advocate for interconnected struggles illustrates a rare clarity of purpose: she sees climate, justice, and human rights as inseparable. At 22, she continues to defy expectations, using moral authority and global attention to shine a light on the world’s most pressing injustices. In doing so, she embodies the defining spirit of Gen Z activism: fearless, principled, and unafraid to confront power wherever it exists.
Greta’s politics do not exist in isolation. The same moral clarity, shaped by early confrontation with power, appeared in another corner of the world. In Hong Kong, it has taken the form of Joshua Wong.
At 28, Wong has spent more than half of his adult life on the frontlines of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, embodying a generation that refuses to bow to oppression. First rising to global prominence at 15 during the 2014 “Umbrella Movement”, Wong helped organise massive student strikes demanding democratic reforms, earning a spot on TIME’s Most Influential Teens list. His activism came at tremendous personal cost: multiple stints in prison, including four years and eight months under the national security law, and ongoing legal battles for allegedly seeking international support for Hong Kong’s democracy.
In 2025, he faced fresh charges for allegedly seeking international support for democracy (offences carrying potential life imprisonment), but his resolve remains unshaken.
Just as Thunberg addressed geopolitical violence and Wong resisted authoritarian erasure, a Pakistani changemaker challenged power closer to home.
Mahnoor Omer, a 25-year-old Gen Z lawyer with little patience for institutional silence, took Pakistan to court over menstruation. In a country where activism is often expected to be (and generally even is) male-led or safely abstract, Omer chose a far more confrontational route. By challenging the taxation of sanitary products, she reframed a “women’s issue” as a constitutional one, forcing the law to confront how equality and access are denied through negligent policies. She identified a pressure point where stigma, economics, and governance intersect. And pushed.
Unlike older models of activism that often relied on policy memos or closed-door advocacy, Gen Z’s interventions tend to emerge from frustration that translates into action. For Omer, that frustration crystallised around period poverty. “My friend Ahsan Jehangir Khan, also a lawyer, and I had a discussion about how helpless we feel and how the law can be used as a tool to bring about change,” she said.
They used the tools immediately available to them to expose how the state normalises gendered deprivation. In doing so, they punctured a stigma with confidence. This is Gen Z activism at its most effective: grounded in lived reality and willing to institutionalise dissent.
In a culture that routinely writes off young women’s anger as excess or conveniently blames it on “hormones” and treats their demands as nuisance, Omer refused to shrink herself. Similar to her global counterparts, she did not dilute her politics to make them easier to swallow. The discomfort, after all, was the point.
Gen Z is hard to ignore, even harder to stop
What is most disarming about this generation is its refusal of escapism. The next time you’re scrolling your “For You” page and stumble upon a video dissecting how capitalism and pop-culture feminism make a spectacularly insufferable duo — say, via a critique of Katy Perry and other celebrity women popping off to space — know this: that analysis is intentional.
In an online ecosystem engineered to numb and distract, Gen Z keeps insisting on return: to the body, to the street, to the material world. If information overload is meant to paralyse, this cohort works against it; Gen Z annotates it, memes it, dismantles it, and sends it back sharpened.
While previous generations sought escape online, Gen Z seems determined to use the internet to come back to the world: more literate in power and more suspicious of optics.
This is not a generation that believes history will save it, or that time alone delivers justice. It is one that keeps asking: what is happening, who benefits, how does this connect to me, and what, exactly, am I going to do about it?

Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve. Last year, over two dozen citizens were wounded in celebratory aerial firing
According to the information given by Edhi, a total of 28 people were brought to hospitals across the city after suffering injuries from stray bullets, with the youngest victim being 11-years-old.
Sixteen people were brought to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), including a 32-year-old man from North Nazimabad, a 16-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man from Mehmoodabad, a 24-year-old woman from Qayyumabad, and a 71-year-old man from Manzoor Colony.
An 18-year-old man from Korangi, a 24-year-old man from Azam Town, a 55-year-old man and an 18-year-old man from Saddar were also brought to the hospital. A 33-year-old woman from Gulistan-i-Johar Block 2, a 43-year-old woman from Scheme 33 in Gulzar-e-Hijri, and an 18-year-old boy from Landhi were also brought to the facility.

A 22-year-old man was brought to Liaquat National Hospital from Safoora, while an 11-year-old girl from Korangi was brought to the Sindh Government Hospital.
On Wednesday, Sindh police had urged citizens to refrain from aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling on New Year’s Eve. In a statement, police had also warned of strict legal action against those involved in aerial firing, calling on citizens to act responsibly.
First Lady and MNA, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, on Wednesday had also called on citizens to celebrate responsibly.
“Aerial firing costs innocent lives every year. Senseless shooting can turn moments of joy into tragedy. Be responsible and celebrate safely!” she said in a post on social media platform X.

The 34-year-old Democrat took his oath of office at an abandoned subway stop under City Hall just after midnight to take the helm of the United States’ largest city. He will be New York’s first Muslim mayor.
His office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people, after the 34-year-old Democrat campaigned on promises to address the soaring cost of living.
NBC News reported that Mamdani took the oath with his hands on two copies of the Holy Quran — one belonging to his grandfather and the other from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Centre for Research in Black Culture.

“Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,” said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. “This is truly an honour and a privilege of a lifetime.”
He also called the ornate subway station “a testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health, and the legacy of our city”.
Mamdani’s private swearing-in to start his four-year term was performed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud. His wife, Rama Duwaji, was also present alongside him.

According to CNN, his parents, filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, were also in attendance.
A larger, ceremonial inauguration is scheduled later on Thursday with speeches from left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Around 4,000 ticketed guests are expected to attend the event outside City Hall.
Mamdani’s team has also organised a block party that it says will enable tens of thousands of people to watch the ceremony at streetside viewing areas along Broadway.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who’s in charge of America’s most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight.
Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at age seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing with only a relatively brief stint in politics, becoming a member of the New York State Assembly before being elected mayor.
He is surrounding himself with seasoned aides recruited from past mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden’s government.

 

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom predicted a massive exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have debunked those claims.
He has promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.
Mamdani had inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than two million voters and took 50 per cent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><small>2026-01-01 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0112241256ad76f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964460/cjp-afridi-says-judiciary-to-pursue-meaningful-reforms-in-2026-to-improve-accessibility-strengthen-transparency' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi says judiciary to pursue ‘meaningful reforms’ in 2026 to improve accessibility, strengthen transparency</strong></a><br><p>In his New Year’s message, Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi has said that the judiciary will “pursue meaningful reforms” in 2026 in a bid to improve accessibility, reduce delay and strengthen transparency in the justice system.
In a message posted on the Supreme Court’s website, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Afridi conveyed his greetings to the people, members of the judiciary and the legal fraternity on the new year.
“In the coming year, the judiciary will pursue meaningful reforms aimed at improving accessibility, reducing delay, strengthening transparency, and responsibly leveraging technology in the service of justice,” he said.
He said that the efforts would be guided by “a clear focus on outcomes that matter most to the public — timely decisions, understandable processes, and courts that are approachable and humane”.
CJP Afridi maintained that it was the judiciary’s responsibility to “ensure that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done — fairly, impartially, and without delay“.

 

“This responsibility acquires deeper meaning when viewed through the lived experience of ordinary citizens who approach our courts with hope, vulnerability, and trust,” the CJP said.
He underscored that the new year called on the judiciary “to reflect, to reform, and to renew our commitment to a justice system that places the citizen at its very centre“.
He asserted that “justice must be accessible in practice, not merely in principle; dignified in process, not just in outcome; and responsive to the needs of women, children, the marginalised, and those living in remote and underserved regions”.
The CJP expressed confidence that “through collective resolve, professionalism, and integrity, the judiciary will continue to strengthen public trust and uphold the ideals enshrined in our Constitution“.
He reaffirmed the “judiciary’s unwavering commitment to serve every citizen with fairness, independence, and compassion”.
CJP Afridi hoped that the new year would “bring renewed confidence in the rule of law and a justice system that truly reaches every doorstep.”</p><small>2026-01-01 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01074636804edfc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964432/we-envision-a-promising-future-for-pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-says-pm-shehbaz-after-phone-call-with-mbs' target='_blank'><strong>We envision a promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, says PM Shehbaz after phone call with MBS</strong></a><br><p>After a phone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Wednesday that the two leaders envisioned an “exciting and promising future” for both countries.
In a post on the social media platform X on Thursday morning, the premier echoed the statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) a day earlier.
Calling it a “warm and most cordial telephone conversation”, PM Shehbaz said the two “reaffirmed our shared commitment to further strengthening the long-standing fraternal bonds between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which have attained new heights in recent months”.
“While expressing Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the kingdom, we also exchanged views on the regional situation, emphasising the need for unity within the Ummah and maintaining regional peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.







PM Shehbaz said he was “grateful” to the Saudi crown prince, who reaffirmed the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest and also “shared his intention to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the coming year”.
“Together, we envision an exciting and promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
A similar statement was also issued by the PMO a day earlier, when the premier had also met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy at the Prime Minister’s House to discuss regional and global developments.
The prime minister reiterated the need to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy.
He expressed satisfaction over bilateral relations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further deepening ties, while appreciating Saudi Arabia’s support for Pakistan and its role in promoting regional peace and stability, the statement said.
The prime minister recalled his meetings with the crown prince during the year, which he said had been highly productive and contributed significantly to elevating Pak-Saudi ties to new levels.
He also expressed deep appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s consistent support to Pakistan in times of need and its constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability.
Ambassador Al-Malkiy conveyed greetings from the Saudi leadership and reiterated the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.</p><small>2026-01-01 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642582-pakistan-witnesses-17-drop-in-terror-attacks-since-afghan-border-closure-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan witnesses 17% drop in terror attacks since Afghan border closure: report</strong></a><br><p>

US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, announced two sets of strikes, which were carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Tuesday, “three narco-trafficking vessels traveling as a convoy” were targeted in “international waters,” it said in a statement on X.







“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.
Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing the vessels traveling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.
The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

 

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system,” without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.
Hours later, it issued a second statement about strikes on two more vessels conducted on Wednesday, killing five people. Again, it was not clear where the strikes took place.
Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.
International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.
In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of running a drug cartel.
Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</p><small>2026-01-01 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642579-jaishankar-knew-what-he-was-doing-sadiq-describes-his-interaction-with-indian-fm-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>'Jaishankar knew what he was doing', Sadiq describes his interaction with Indian FM in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May was among the contentious matters mediated by Beijing in 2025.
India has repeatedly rejected claims made by US President Donald Trump that Washington had mediated the ceasefire.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs has not reacted to the claim made by Mr Wang. But it has maintained that the ceasefire with Islamabad was not the result of mediation. The decision to stop the firing was taken after the Pakistani director general of military operations had called his Indian counterpart, New Delhi has said.
“China’s claims of mediating betw­een India and Pakistan are concerning — not just because they contradict what has been told to the country’s people so far, but also because they appear to mock our national security,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a social media post.
Mr Wang was commenting on China’s role in a tricky world. “This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII [World War II],” Mr Wang said at a conference on China’s foreign relations in Beijing. “Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread.”
To build lasting peace, “we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes”, the Chinese minister added.
“Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he claimed.

This is the third time the police have used force to break up the sit-in outside the prison. Imran’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan, and Noreen Niazi, besides scores of supporters, have been staging weekly protests outside the jail to demand a meeting with Mr Khan.

TTAP says struggle to continue despite govt ‘heavy-handedness’

Videos shared by the PTI Punjab account on the social media platform X after 1am showed water cannons targeting protesters. “In the severe cold, an attack with water cannons was carried out on unarmed, peaceful children, women, and citizens,” the X post said.







In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan condemned the use of water cannons and the arrest of Imran’s sisters and other PTI workers. The police, in a late-night operation, used water cannon to disperse the protesters and also arrested the sisters. However, they were later released near Chakri on the motorway.
In its statement, the opposition alliance alleged that the water used to scatter the PTI supporters was laced with a chemical and hundreds of supporters were “badly affected”. The TTAP spokesperson said that such tactics would not deter them from their stance that the violation of basic human rights should be stopped. They will continue the struggle, the statement added.
On the other hand, the PTI shared another list of six persons with the Adiala Jail administration, requesting it to allow them to meet Imran Khan on Thursday. The letter, written to the Adiala jail superintendent and signed by Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, mentioned Dr Amjad, Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Jamal Khan, Iqbal Khattak, and Shoaib Ameer Awan.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 has mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the court order was not being complied with.

Terrorist attacks went down by almost 17 per cent in December, preceded by 9pc decline in November. Terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials also fell in the last quarter of 2025, by nearly 4pc and 19pc each in November and December, shows data collected by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of its annual security report 2025.

 

With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, the year 2025 went by as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, says the report. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with almost 38pc in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024, and 34pc in 2025.
The comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveals a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2555 in 2024 to 3417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34pc year-on-year surge in violence.

CRSS report says most significant surge in violence recorded in KP

The most significant surge in violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the fatalities rose from 1620 in 2024 to 2331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.
Balochistan also had an upward trend, with fatalities increasing from 787 to 956; an additional 169 deaths, which are nearly 22pc higher than the previous year’s figures.
Regional impact of violence
Violence remained heavily concentrated in the country’s northwestern KP and southwestern Balochistan provinces, with both accounting for over 96pc of all fatalities and almost 93pc of violent incidents recorded during the entire 2025.
KP was the worst-hit region, suffering over 68pc (2331) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and around 63pc (795) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, accounting for 28pc (956) of the fatalities and over 30pc (386) of the incidents of violence.

 

In contrast, Punjab and Sindh experienced comparatively lower levels of violence. The former recorded 25 incidents of violence resulting in 40 fatalities and 24 injuries, representing just 1.15pc of total casualties, while the latter saw 51 incidents causing 56 fatalities and 40 injuries; 1.73pc of the total.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory though incidents numbers remained minimal, the injury figures were relatively high, with the former recording 103 injuries, and the latter registering 38, from just five incidents at each location.
Gilgit-Baltistan remained the least affected region. Compared to last year, though small in absolute numbers, the region recorded a four-fold increase from one to four fatalities.

In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot petrol price was reduced to Rs253.17 per litre from its previous price of Rs263.45. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Meanwhile, the ex-depot price of HSD was decreased to Rs257.08 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs265.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964388/president-pm-urge-unity' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM urge unity</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday called upon the people and political forces to recommit themselves to safeguarding the country amid global, domestic challenges and hailed the nation’s resilience and paid tribute to the country’s martyrs.
