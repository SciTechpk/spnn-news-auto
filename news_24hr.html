The tremor was the third within 24 hours.
The most recent quake measured 3.2 on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar 3.6-magnitude tremor at 5:33pm yesterday.
Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.
A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.
 
 

Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad has confirmed a new case of wild poliovirus in district Diamer of GB.
This is the first case of wild poliovirus reported from GB and the 11th confirmed case in Pakistan this year, said a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.
The third nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025, which began on 26 May, concluded yesterday, successfully reaching over 45 million children under five years of age across 159 districts, including high-risk areas of the country.
Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease with no cure. The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunisation schedule.
The programme called on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.
GB reports first case
GB Health Secretary Asifullah Khan confirmed that a 23-month-old child has been diagnosed with poliovirus in Tangir area of district Diamer.
He said that the child has not travelled outside the area, however, the virus strain has been confirmed to originate from Liaquatabad area of Karachi.
Khan observed that there is a record of administering polio drops to the child. However, he added that child was not provided with the vaccines given after immediately after birth.
To a question, the health secretary said that the department has not announced the detection of the polio virus to the public but the case has been confirmed. Before the latest case, there has been no reported case of poliovirus in GB and the region was declared a polio-free zone.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Last year, the country reported more than 70 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in February, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively. Around one million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign.</p><small>2025-06-02 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/683d0ea47b999.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914893/haris-blistering-ton-sees-pakistan-complete-t20-series-sweep-over-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Haris’ blistering ton sees Pakistan complete T20 series sweep over Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Pakistan’s pursuit of adapting the “modern-day” approach towards white-ball cricket seemed to have reached manifestation in the first two games of their three-match Twenty20 International series against Bangladesh.
But on Sunday night, here at the Gadd­afi Stadium, in front of jam-packed sta­nds, it was evident that the hosts were transitioning quite well into the new style.
And it was Mohammad Haris who demonstrated it in the most brutal of ways, plundering a 45-ball century — his maiden T20I ton — to see Pakistan thrash Bangladesh by seven wickets in the third and final match of the series, completing the clean sweep — the side’s first series win at home since December 2021.
 


The wicket-keeper/batter — the first Pakistan non-opener to score a T20I century — remained unbeaten on 107 off 46 balls, having struck eight fours and seven sixes, as Pakistan chased down the 197-run target with 16 balls to spare.
Haris came in to bat after Pakistan had lost opener Sahibzada Farhan in the first over — and never looked back.
The right-hander started with consecutive fours off pacer Hasan Mahmud before taking on Mehidy Hasan Miraz for another.
Haris smashed Khaled Ahmed’s pace past deep square, then lifted the right-armer over deep fine-leg for his first six. Saim Ayub, who had struggled for runs in the first two matches, pulled Mahmud for a six and a four in the next over as Pakistan reached 56-1 at the end of the powerplay.
Saim bludgeoned pacer Tanzim Hasan for a towering six over deep midwicket before cutting Rishad Hossain for a four, while Haris pulled the leg-spinner’s half-tracker for his second six in the eighth over.
After Haris brought up his maiden T20I fifty with a six and a four off Tanzim, Saim (45 off 29, two fours and four sixes) holed out to Tanzid Hasan at long-on.
The incoming Hasan Nawaz played Tanzim deftly to get off the mark with a four before lifting Rishad gracefully over wide long-off as Pakistan cruised. Hasan, however, departed in the 13th over after clubbing Mehidy for a six and a four, leaving Pakistan needing 60 runs in seven overs.
Haris’ flow never broke; the right-hander creamed Tanzim over mid-off for six before picking two boundaries off Rishad in the next over, which also saw Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha drive the spinner over the infield and through the covers.
Haris went after Khaled for another maximum over long-leg and cracked Mahmud through the off-side before bringing up his century with a double. He cleared the long-off boundary once again before Salman finished the game off with a four and a single off Towhid Hridoy in the 18th over.
Earlier, a brisk 110-run opening stand between Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain had powered Bangladesh to 196-6, but Pakistan clawed back in the death overs, led by Abbas Afridi’s disciplined bowling at the backend of the innings.
Parvez was the aggressor early on, smashing 66 off just 34 deliveries — laced with seven boundaries and four sixes — while Tanzid added a steady 42 off 32 balls (three fours and three sixes). Their partnership laid a solid foundation before Pakistan hit back in the second half of the innings.
Abbas, who was expensive in his initial spell, returned with precision at the death, conceding just eight runs in his final two overs and finishing with figures of 2-26. Pakistan restricted the visitors to just 46 runs in the final five overs while claiming four wickets.
Pakistan’s decision to open the bowling with Saim backfired as Parvez took him apart in the third over, hitting two sixes down the ground and sweeping him for four. Tanzid continued the assault in the following over, striking Hasan Ali for two boundaries before Parvez added two more off Faheem Ashraf.

The momentum continued as Abbas was also dispatched for boundaries in the sixth over, with Bangladesh reaching 53-0 by the end of the powerplay.
Tanzid then took on skipper Salman, lofting him for six, before Parvez attacked in-form spinner Abrar Ahmed, smashing him for a six over midwicket and following up with back-to-back boundaries to bring up his fifty in just 26 balls.
At the halfway mark, Bangladesh stood at 99 without loss. The breakthrough finally came in the 11th over when Tanzid was caught at short fine-leg by Abrar off Faheem, but not before Parvez had launched him for a six and a four.
Parvez departed soon after, miscuing a sweep to Haris behind the wickets. However, Towhid and skipper Litton Das consolidated, taking Bangladesh to 150-2 by the end of the 15th over.
Abbas returned to bowl a tight 15th over, giving away only six runs. Litton ended a brief boundary drought with a four off Hasan Ali but was bowled on the very next ball while attempting a ramp shot.
Shamim Hossain provided a brief flourish with two boundaries off Hasan, but Abbas struck again in the 18th over, dismissing both Shamim and Towhid while conceding just two runs.
Jaker Ali chipped in with a four and a six off Faheem in the penultimate over, while Tanzim hit a six off a no-ball from Hasan Ali, who had earlier removed Mehidy.

I was lucky to grow up in that Karachi. A city where cricket was not a proxy for politics, but a portal into grace, grit, and genius. Our coaches didn’t teach us whom to cheer based on flags; they taught us to revere Sunil Gavaskar if we wanted to learn the art of attrition, and Gordon Greenidge if we sought the fury of a square cut in full bloom. We were taught that genius bowed to no border. Which is why, today, I feel no conflict in mourning Virat Kohli’s exit. In times like these, when vitriol comes easier than virtue, this piece is not written in protest or praise. It is written in remembrance. For the game we once loved. And the way we were once taught to love it.

There are English summers, and then there are English summers that contain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. The former are pleasant; the latter, unforgettable. This year, the roses will still bloom, and the Barmy Army will still sing. But the air will be thinner, the echoes fainter, because this is a summer robbed of its lords. First, Rohit Sharma stepped away — quietly, gracefully. And now, so has Virat Kohli.
What remains is not merely the absence of players; it is the departure of meaning. A certain class of Test cricket, the kind that moved philosophers and CEOs alike, has drawn its curtain.
The absence feels architectural. As if two marble columns were quietly removed from a historic pavilion, with the entire structure now precariously leaning toward collapse. One could still enter, but who would stand in awe?
 
 

And yes, we will watch. Ben Stokes deserves that. The man has turned trauma into leadership and chaos into a story. He will give every ounce of himself to this series, and it is only right that we show up.
But let us not pretend. Not all cricketers are made equal. Some you watch casually; others, you rearrange your life for. Across boardrooms in Zurich, Karachi, Sydney, and Palo Alto, people rescheduled earnings calls, postponed honeymoons, and stepped out of climate summits simply to witness Kohli in whites, confronting once more the fraught architecture of the fifth-stump line. A craftsman in prolonged dialogue with imperfection, he embodied what many might recognise as the Romantic Peril of Test Cricket, the very paradox that makes the long form so intellectually and emotionally compelling.
But now? With the great ones gone, and the new ones still waiting to become legends, it’s harder to justify the same trade-offs. With Virat absent, the return on investment for five days of Test cricket has fundamentally shifted.

This is not a critique of the younger players. They are brilliant, earnest, and committed. But some of us still believe that respect is not a courtesy; it is a currency. You don’t give up five days of a sanctuary vacation or abandon a boardroom just to watch a rough diamond endure its necessary grind at the crease. You do it for the rare performer whose genius warrants the interruption of your own.
Which brings us, inevitably, to the question: why now? Why would Kohli walk away at the peak of his fitness, form, and fervour? There isn’t one reason. It never works that way.
The farewell
Great careers end the way great loves do, not with one betrayal or a single heartbreak, but with the erosion of belief.
Still, if one moment hastened this farewell, it may have been the appointment of Gautam Gambhir. His arrival may not be the cause. But it might well have been the final straw. Because when players like Kohli, Rohit, and Ravichandran Ashwin step away almost in concert, you don’t need an inquiry. You need a mirror.
 
 

Managing genius is a genius act. Ask anyone who worked with Steve Jobs, Branson, or who still survives under Elon. This isn’t about control; it’s about alignment. You don’t manage someone like Virat Kohli. You understand him. You protect his purpose. You locate his why, and you build everything else around it.
I’ve watched too many small men in large roles fumble this truth. Men who climbed ladders not because they inspired others, but because they complied better. They ended up managing teams far sharper than themselves. And predictably began dimming the lights to hide the contrast. There is no faster way to kill a company. Or a cricket team.
Gautam Gambhir, for all his grit, has never radiated the intellectual largesse required to steward players who are larger than himself. He may be a good lieutenant. But this job needs a philosopher-general, someone who understands that great players don’t just need a plan. They need belief, clarity, and a sense of shared meaning.

Consulting firm IDEO would call this a systemic misalignment between cultural intent and leadership archetype: a failure to preserve the tacit rituals, values, and emotional contracts that define high-performing creative ecosystems. Friends at McKinsey might frame it as a breakdown in vertical coherence — when the ethos at the top no longer resonates with the motivations of key talent.
My favourite organisational theorist today calls it a leadership incongruence error. Upon encountering my blank stare, she added: “It’s the insertion of a low-agency operator into a high-autonomy, high-purpose environment.” The result is not just friction. It is institutional dissonance.
I say: unforgivable.

Unka rutba tha, magar rooh kahin aur thi,


Jaise mehfil mein aangan ka diya le aaya ho koi


He held the rank, but his spirit wandered,


like bringing a courtyard lamp to a gathering of stars

An institutional misreading
This isn’t new. In Silicon Valley, where I live and work, the pattern is familiar. Startups are littered with the stories of brilliant founders brought to their knees not by markets, but by middling managers promoted beyond their capacity. Think of when HP chose Carly Fiorina, or when Yahoo staggered through a carousel of CEOs, or when Apple, briefly, forgot it needed Steve Jobs.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India is most culpable here. This isn’t a team in need of discipline. It is a constellation in need of choreography. And at its most delicate moment of transition, when what was needed was vision, they reached for order.
Because genius does not shrink to fit into systems, systems must grow to contain genius. That the BCCI could not see this, could not anticipate the vacuum they were creating, is perhaps the most damning evidence of all.
 
 

Kohli’s retirement is not just the end of a player’s journey. It is the culmination of an institutional misreading. The result is visible, not just in the cricket, but in the quiet goodbyes. He didn’t leave because he stopped loving the game. He left because the game stopped understanding the kind of love he gave it.
This is a failure of leadership. A failure to identify the why, and to protect it at all costs.
In every great team, the leader’s first task is not strategy. It is stewardship. To recognise the genius in the room, and to ensure that genius feels seen, respected, and called to something greater than itself. That didn’t happen here. And so, the greatest storyteller of this era has packed up his pen.
Nevertheless, the game will go on, the scoreboard will still tick. But those of us who came not just to see runs, but to feel reverence, will know: something sacred has slipped away.

The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, where migrants represent a sizable share of the workforce, lie in one of the planet’s hottest regions where summer temperatures often edge towards 50 degrees Celsius.
“Every summer reveals that the climate crisis aggravates the occupational health and safety catastrophe for the millions of migrant workers dangerously exposed to extreme heat,” said Michael Page, HRW’s deputy Middle East director.
“Because Gulf states are dragging their feet on evidence-based labour protections, migrant workers are unnecessarily dying, experiencing kidney failure, and suffering from other chronic illnesses,” he added.
The wealthy Gulf states rely heavily on millions of migrant workers, particularly in construction, the majority of whom hail from India and Pakistan. Last month, the UAE breached its May temperature record for the second day in a row, hitting 51.6 degrees Celsius.
 
 

To protect labourers, the states ban work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas at peak heat hours from mid-June until mid-September as part of a longstanding “midday break” policy.
But with the Gulf particularly vulnerable to climate change, HRW said  “these extreme heat conditions are now more frequent and earlier, in May”, before the midday break comes into effect.
A electrician in Kuwait interviewed by the New York-based rights group said he would feel  “dizziness, vomiting, head pain, and blurry vision many times,” working during the summer months and  “many people fall down because of heat”.
HRW urged authorities and businesses to move away from  “calendar-based midday bans,” to risk-based measures to gauge occupational heat stress.
Scientists have shown that recurring heatwaves are a clear marker of global warming and that these heatwaves are set to become more frequent, longer and more intense.
The number of extremely hot days has nearly doubled globally in the past three decades.
According to a 2024 report from the International Labour Organisation, a United Nations agency, outdoor workers in Arab states face some of the highest exposure to heat stress in the world, with 83.6 percent suffering from excessive heat exposure on the job.

The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a flurry of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.
 






Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.
“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.
 
 

He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.
“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.
The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p><small>2025-06-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021109393c34de4.jpg?r=111234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914813/rising-electricity-rates-tax-burden-still-concerns-citizens-report' target='_blank'><strong>Rising electricity rates, tax burden still concerns citizens: report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While economic concerns continue to ease, rising electricity prices and the tax burden remain worrying for more Pakistanis.
This was the crux of the Consumer Confidence Index for the second quarter of the current year conducted by research company Ipsos. The survey was carried out across the country with over 1,000 people interviewed via telephone.
When asked about the most worrying issues, the respondents cited electricity bills and continuously increasing taxes.
However, the findings showed that two in five Pakistanis believed the country was on the right track. Optimism was at its peak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by Punjab - higher among rural population and middle-income groups.
The report claimed that optimism had increased sharply in last couple of years, now breaking all records, reaching the ever highest in six years. Moreover, three in 10 Pakistanis believed that the country’s economic condition was strong. Current perceptions of economy being strong are ever highest since August 2019.
It claimed that one in five Pakistanis now feels more comfortable while meeting household expenses than a year ago. There is even better feeling in rural citizens.
The survey report added that one in five Pakistanis was now comfortable in making daily household purchases and this ratio nearly doubled in the last one year.
Replying to a question about the future, two in five Pakistanis expected that the economy will get stronger in next six months, with Punjab (41pc) and lower-middle class (43pc) being most optimistic. It is the first time in the last six years that optimism about local economic conditions has just overtaken pessimism.
 
 

More than one in three Pakistanis also expected their personal financial conditions would get stronger in the next six months. Women and young citizens were more optimistic. While one-fourth Pakistanis feel confident to invest in future, reaching ever highest in six years, confidence in the ability to make major purchases jumped to 17pc from mere 1pc a couple of years ago.
According to the report, three in 10 Pakistanis felt secure about jobs with rural people and middle-income groups and youth being more secure. Confidence in job security has attained its best level since 2019.
Comparison with other countries
Over the last one quarter, Pakistan observed a positive change (4 pts) in Global Consumer Confidence Index.
With constant improvements in the last quarter, Pakistan maintains its position above Türkiye in rankings, but well below other similar countries such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and the global average.

The implication was clear: that interacting with generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is somehow an extravagant and irresponsible use of electricity. It is the kind of sanctimonious alarmism that sounds intelligent until you hold it up to basic scrutiny.
Because if we’re going to start measuring digital behaviour by the drop, let’s at least be consistent. How many litres are poured into the void eve­ry time someone binge-watches an entire season on Netflix in HD?
How many hours are spent mi­­ndlessly refreshing timelines, watching algorithmically served rage bait, or uploading the fifth fil­­tered version of a sunset or a workout video for some Instagram validation? These, too, are digital actions. They, too, have a carbon cost. But somehow, they escape critique, not because they’re cleaner but because they’re culturally familiar. We’ve normalised that waste, so we don’t see it.
 
 

It’s not that AI and crypto shouldn’t be held to environmental standards; they absolutely should. But let’s not pretend that the sudden concern about electricity and water consumption is rooted in climate justice. It’s not. It’s rooted in a deep discomfort with change, with disruption, and with technologies that threaten to redistribute power away from legacy structures, and towards something less familiar, less controllable, and potentially more liberating. This is much less about the energy, or the climate, and much more about inertia masquerading as morality.
At the cost of repetition, the point is not to excuse AI’s energy demands but to highlight the absurdity of pretending that prompting GPT is where the guilt should begin. These criticisms aren’t rooted in environmental justice but the fear of technological disruption, especially of tools that could shift knowledge creation, creative production, and economic opportunity outside the gates of elite institutions.

Pakistan’s newfound enthusiasm for crypto doesn’t have to follow the chaotic arc seen elsewhere.

I’ve been noticing similar fear-mongering around Pakistan’s recent interest in crypto and AI, especially the chorus of concern over energy consumption. The government’s announcement to dedicate two gigawatts of power towards AI data centres and crypto mining has triggered a kind of moral panic that feels less about climate and more about control.
 
 

Overnight, everyone’s turned into an energy auditor, as if this country hasn’t spent decades watching power get siphoned off by inefficient state-owned enterprises, bloated real estate empires, and unmetered political favour. Now, when the state finally signals an intention to invest in frontier tech, industries that might bring Pakistan into the modern digital economy, it’s met with outrage dressed up as environmentalism.
Let’s be honest: this isn’t about the electricity. It’s about the shift. About newer, faster players entering spaces traditionally guarded by bureaucracy and old power structures. It’s about the fear of Pakistan participating in a world its critics no longer fully understand.
If we’re serious about addressing the environmental cost of emerging technologies like AI and crypto, the answer is to steer it responsibly, and not outrightly shut it down. That means demanding transparency from data centres on their ener­­gy and water use, pushing for cleaner energy integration, and incentivising green infrastructure, not stoking public fear to stall progress.
An inclusive approach understands that Pakistan, already trailing in tech, can’t afford to sit out the AI revolution. At the same time, it also can’t replicate the dirty models of the past. The task is to build a roadmap where innovation and sustainability are­­n’t seen as opposing forces but as twin imperatives.
But that roadmap can’t be built in isolation. Voluntary commitments by tech companies to switch to clean energy have, time and again, proven inadequate. What’s needed now is serious advocacy that targets global forums, from the United Nations to international standard-setting bodies, to push for binding protocols that compel technology firms to meet stringent environmental obligations. The burden of sustainability cannot rest on consumer guilt or national regulation alone; it must be enforced at the level where tech power actually resides.
As for Pakistan’s new love for crypto, there are far more pressing questions to be asked than the performative panic over electricity consumption. Who is shaping the regulatory framework? Who stands to benefit, and who might be excluded? Is this going to be another playground for politically connected actors to mine profit under the guise of innovation, or can it become a legitimate avenue for financial inclusion in a country where access to traditional banking remains out of reach for millions?
The energy question is real, but it can’t be the only lens. We need to talk about transparency, governance, digital rights and whether this tech will empower or further marginalise. The conversation must move past the performative activism and dig into the architecture being quietly built. If we don’t shape it now, we’ll find ourselves locked out of systems that claim to be open.
Pakistan’s newfound enthusiasm for crypto doesn’t have to follow the chaotic, exploitative arc seen elsewhere. This moment presents a chance to do it differently, to design systems that are transparent, inclusive, and locally rooted. Crypto can be more than just speculative trading and mining farms; it can be a way to reimagine financial access, to build tools for remittances, savings, and digital ownership for people excluded from formal banking. But that requires intent.
We need a regulatory framework built in consultation with technologists, civil society, and financial experts, and not just the enforcement bodies. We need clarity, not criminalisation; guardrails, not gatekeeping.
If Pakistan wants to embrace crypto, it must also invest in public literacy, consumer protections, and infrastructure that ensures the benefits are not just concentrated at the top. This doesn’t have to be a rushed gold rush. It can be a careful, deliberate step towards something fairer, but only if we’re brave enough to move past the performative actions.

A high-level Pakistani delegation — consisting of two former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York on Sunday for consultations at the United Nations.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Sherry Rehman, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Teh­mina Janjua, Mussadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir, Bushra Anjum Butt and Faisal Sabzwari comprise the delegation.
The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council, and will address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) envoys.
The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations. Their focus will be on conveying Pakistan’s concerns about regional security and responding to what it calls India’s “escalatory moves”.
This outreach is part of a dual-track strategy involving both official and informal engagements.
Another formal delegation from Islamabad — expected to be led by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal — is also due soon for trade-related discussions with US officials.
On the Indian side, a parallel delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is also due in Washington on June 3, while Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri concluded a three-day official visit this past week.
 
 

“This is no longer just about border skirmishes,” a senior Pakistani diplomat said. “This is about shaping the international narrative to reflect ground realities.”
In Islamabad, there is growing concern that New Delhi has moved swiftly to frame the conflict in a way that revives scrutiny of Pakistan in multilateral bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the UN. Pakistan’s counteroffensive seeks to prevent what it sees as an Indian effort to turn the recent crisis into a long-term diplomatic liability for Islamabad.
“This is a political campaign masquerading as financial oversight,” said one Pakistani official, referring to India’s push to revisit Pakistan’s FATF status. “We exited the grey list in 2022 after implementing a comprehensive reform programme. There is no technical basis for reopening that file.”
 
 

Former diplomats in the delegation stress that Pakistan’s approach centres on transparency, restraint and reform. “We responded with maturity when provoked. That’s the story we are telling here — with facts, not slogans,” said one member.
Senator Sherry Rehman, who is also part of the visiting delegation, emphasised that Pakistan is advancing its own priorities while actively responding to Indian narratives.
“We have our own agenda to advance, but yes, when Indian allegations are brought up, make no mistake — we will use forensic chapter and factual verse. Myth will not be allowed to become the message on Pakistan this time,” she said.
Dar-Lammy call
Separately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy agreed to strengthen cooperation in multilateral forums, particularly at the United Nations Security Council.
 






The understanding came during a conversation between the two diplomats, following Lammy’s recent visit to Pakistan — his first official trip — during which he met senior officials amid heightened tensions with neighbouring India.
The two sides also agreed to remain in contact and meet again on the sidelines of high-level UN events scheduled in New York later this month.

LAHORE: President Asif Ali Zardari greets PM Shehbaz Sharif ahead of their meeting at Governor’s House.—White Star

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met on Sunday to discuss the political climate and security challenges facing the country, and vowed to cement the coalition bond in the ‘national interest’.
PM Shehbaz met President Zardari at Governor House in Lahore, where both leaders also discussed the upcoming federal budget along with political situation in the country.
 






“Political allies need to move forward together in the national interest,” an official release quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
He emphasised the need for unity among all coalition partners, including PML-N and PPP.
During the meeting, the leaders held wide-ranging discussions on national affairs, including the prevailing political and security situation in the country.

Army chief vows to crush enemy’s nefarious designs in Balochistan

The participants also reviewed the outcome of the prime minister’s recent visit to friendly nations and their significance for Pakistan’s foreign relations.
The meeting was also attended by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
People-friendly budget
President Zardari, while highlighting the importance of public welfare, urged the government to take practical and impactful steps in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man.
“The government must take measures in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man,” he added.
A source in the PMO said the premier also apprised President Zardari about his visit to Quetta along with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and their meeting with a grand jirga of the elders of Balochistan’s different tribes and clans.
PM Shehbaz expressed the hope that the meeting with jirga will bear fruit and help restore peace in the province.
Earlier, Field Marshal Munir, in his address at the jirga, vowed to “crush” terrorists in Balochistan, stating that India’s involvement in terrorist activities in the province was “no longer hidden”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
The grand jirga was organised in Quetta a day earlier to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with focus on terrorists receiving support from India.
Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.

Inflation had been on the rise until it faced a slight dip in 2025. Even with the rise in job opportunities due to growing e-commerce and technological advancement, the decrease in the purchasing power of the rupee has made it difficult for people to have a secure source of income once they reach the age of retirement. Economic volatility further creates a lot of problems if a person has not done proper retirement planning.
Why people are not inclined towards retirement planning becomes a prime question for anyone exploring the topic of retirement planning. According to a Dawn report, around 65 million Pakistani workers are not registered in any pension scheme at all and face a demeaning and despondent old age with zero pension.
There could be multiple reasons for people not opting for retirement savings. Primarily, cultural norms are a hindrance in the way of retirement planning. For instance, cultural and societal reliance on family support is preferred over personal savings.
Moreover, there seems to be a general mistrust in non-Islamic financial institutions and investment products, which keeps people from investing for their future consumption. Furthermore, there is a lack of financial literacy and awareness about retirement products among the masses. According to the Global Financial Literacy Survey Report, financial literacy in Pakistan is close to somewhere around 26 per cent. The lack of financial planning due to the aforementioned reasons puts people at great risk when they reach old age.

As life expectancy steadily rises and traditional family support systems weaken, there is greater urgency for retirement planning to become mainstream

Undoubtedly, Pakistan has a large middle class; therefore, there is also an issue of most people having low and unstable incomes, making savings a lesser priority. Given the rising medical costs due to better healthcare equipment and technological advancement, there is a chance that people would suffer from a lack of healthcare affordability.
In addition to this, there are inadequate government-backed pension systems for private sector employees. The Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) remains ineffective due to bureaucratic hurdles. The recent scandal regarding EOBI corruption is one such example of an inefficient institution. Recently, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was apprised that EOBI incorrectly distributed Rs2.79 billion in Old Age Benefit Pensions to 5,131 individuals by altering their recorded ages. This shows the ineffectiveness of the only public retirement fund that exists in the country. All this combines to put people at risk of working into old age due to lack of funds.
As Pakistan’s life expectancy steadily rises and traditional family support systems weaken, there is great urgency for retirement planning to become mainstream. Inflation is continuing to erode the purchasing power of money, which means today’s savings may fall short tomorrow. Thus, relying solely on family support or government welfare introduces the risk of a financially insecure old age. In contrast, retirement planning offers individuals the opportunity to maintain dignity and financial independence even in later years.
The dangers of not engaging in retirement planning are not only limited to individuals, but they extend to the economy as well. Lack of retirement planning puts an increased burden on government welfare programmes and social security. A stronger culture of saving and investment will also strengthen the broader economy. It will ensure more stable domestic capital for growth rather than dependence on foreign loans. Clearly, there are several benefits of retirement planning that Pakistanis need to tap into.
Having established the case for why retirement planning is necessary, it is also important to explore the options people have for retirement planning. To facilitate retirement planning, Pakistan has the Voluntary Pension Schemes (VPS) programme. It is a flexible and a privately managed solution for retirement planning which is available to both salaried and self-employed individuals.
VPS are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and managed by leading asset management companies. These schemes allow participants to make contributions at their own pace in a way that doesn’t burden them financially in the present either. VPS also offer crucial tax incentives under Section 63 of the Income Tax Ordinance. Contributions are deductible from the taxable income of a person and provide the returns on investments that grow tax-free until withdrawals are made.
Certainly, retirement planning is not a luxury but a necessity in today’s Pakistan. It is time to move beyond outdated assumptions of familial support and face the economic realities of ageing. By embracing structured saving avenues like VPS, individuals can secure not just their own futures but contribute to a more stable and self-reliant economy. It is an investment not only in personal well-being but in the nation’s financial resilience.

Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that Constable Shaharyar Ali, 28, was heading some place on his motorbike at around 3:05am when armed assailants, also on a motorcycle, targeted him on Shahrah-i-Pakistan near near Kashti Chowk within the remit of the Yousuf Plaza police station.
He sustained a single bullet wound in the abdomen and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where he died during treatment.
Police sources said that the investigators have obtained CCTV footage near the crime scene. The footage is blurred but it showed that the policeman had stopped his motorbike on the road. In the meantime, two assailants riding a motorcycle emerged there, fired at him and rode away without taking any valuables from him.

No breakthrough made in murder investigation of traffic constable shot dead on May 27, says CTD

The victim was posted at the Anti-Vehicles Lifting Cell (AVLC) and a resident of the Buffer Zone area. He was not in uniform at the time of the incident.
 
 

It appeared to be an incident of targeted killing, but police were investigating the matter to find out the exact motive, the SSP said.
He said the murder did not seem to be robbery related as the killers did not take away slain constable’s pistol, his cell phone, cash and motorbike.
Area SHO Iftikhar Khanzada told Dawn that no case was registered till late in the night as the family was busy in making funeral arrangements.
In a short span of five days, it is the second incident of targeted killing involving a policeman.
Earlier on May 27, an on-duty traffic policeman, Zain Ali Raza, was shot dead within the remit of the Boat Basin police station. Later, a little known group had claimed responsibility for the targeted attack on its Telegram channel.
The police had registered a terrorism case and transferred the investigations to the Counter-Terrorism Department as senior police officers feared resurgence of some banned outfits. Investigators suspected involvement of their sleeper cells in the killing.
So far, no arrest has been made in connection with the May 27 targeted killing case.
CTD DIG Asif Ejaz Sheikh told Dawn that they launched an investigation into the killing of the AVLC policeman.
He, however, said it would be premature to say anything concrete at this moment about the exact motive of the murder.
Regarding the Boat Basin incident, he said that the CTD was working on many leads, but so far, no concrete evidence had emerged about the involvement of any militant group.
He said that the group that had claimed responsibility on Telegram just used its name as ‘Mujahideen’ without naming any specific faction of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The DIG said that the outlawed TTP or Balochistan Liberation Army had used their own social media handles to claim responsibility for their attacks.

Even as he warned in a speech on Saturday that China posed an “imminent” threat, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made clear he wanted Europeans to concentrate on European security as they boosted military budgets.
“We would much prefer that the overwhelming balance of European investment be on that continent…so that as we partner there, which we will continue to do, we’re able to use our comparative advantage as an Indo-Pacific nation to support our partners here,” he said.
Hegseth also noted the absence of his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun, as Beijing instead dispatched a low-level team of military scholars to the annual event, which attracts top defence officials, diplomats, spies and arms dealers from across the world.
The other highlight of the event was the presence of high-powered military delegations from India and Pakistan after four days of intense clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours that were halted by a ceasefire on May 10.
 
 

The delegations, in full uniform and bristling with medal and service ribbons, were led by India’s highest ranking military officer and Pakistan’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. They pointedly kept out of each other’s way in the corridors and meeting halls of the sprawling Shangri-La hotel. On engaging in Asia, at least some European nations signalled they would not be swayed by the US exhortations.
They insisted they would try to stay in both the Asian and European theatres, noting their deep links and vital trade flows as well as the global nature of conflict.
“It is a good thing we are doing more (in Europe), but what I want to stress is that the security of Europe and the security of the Pacific is very much interlinked,” said Europe’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas.
“If you are worried about China, you should be worried about Russia,” Kallas said, underlining the importance of Chinese assistance to the Russian war effort in Ukraine and Moscow’s deployment of North Korean soldiers.
France’s Asian ties
French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that his nation remains an Indo-Pacific power, alluding to its enduring colonial presence in New Caledonia and French Polynesia and the basing of over 8,000 soldiers across the region.
“We are neither China nor the US, we don’t want to depend on either of them,” Macron said at a press conference on Friday, outlining a  “third path” coalition between Europe and Asia that avoided having to choose between Beijing and Washington.
“We want to cooperate with both as far as we can, and we can cooperate for growth and prosperity and stability for our people and the world order, and I think this is exactly the same view of a lot of countries and a lot of people of this region,” he said.
Beyond the rhetoric, regional military attaches and analysts say the European regional presence — and ambitions — may not be easy to shift. Military deployments are mapped out over decades rather than months, and both commercial and defence relationships go back decades, some of them only rarely publicly acknowledged.
The visit of a British aircraft carrier to Singapore later this month is part of a programme first mentioned by then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in 2017 to stress British support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
The carrier visit in part reflects Britain’s commitments under the 54-year-old Five-Power Defence Arrangement that links its military with counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.
British ties with Australia have been bolstered with the recent three-way AUKUS submarine and advanced technology sharing agreement struck with the US — a move that could see British submarines visiting Western Australia.
Singapore, meanwhile, keeps 200 personnel in France operating 12 of its light combat aircraft while Britain also has a jungle training camp and helicopters in Brunei and a 1,200-strong Gurkha battalion, according to International Institute of Strategic Studies data.
A report last month by the London-based IISS highlighted European defence firms’ long-standing and expanding defence ties to Asia, even in the face of competition, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as regional budgets rise.
“European companies, including Airbus, Damen, Naval Group and Thales, have a long-standing presence in Southeast Asia, and other European actors have established themselves in the market in the last decade, including Italy’s Fincantieri and Sweden’s Saab,” the IISS study said.
Saab is close to securing a deal with US ally Thailand to supply its Gripen fighters, beating out Lockheed Martin’s F-16s. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has reported that Asian defence spending rose 46pc in the decade to 2024, reaching $629 billion.
For Finnish officials at least, Hegseth’s remarks resonated — it is Moscow rather than the Indo-Pacific that looms large for Helsinki given the country’s long Russian border.
“When Europe’s defence is in a good shape, then you will have resources to do something more,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen said. “But now all the European countries must do their main focus on European defence so that the United States can do a bigger share in the Indo-Pacific area,” Hakkanen said.

• All fuel stations may be legally required to offer digital payment modes
• Manufacturers, importers may charge extra 2pc GST on cash sales
• Emphasis will be on low-cost digital options instead of costlier POS systems
• Minor tax rate cut expected for salaried class
ISLAMABAD: As part of its strategic direction to declare ‘war on cash’, the federal government is likely to introduce differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital payments across various sectors, including fuel pricing, in the upcoming budget.
This is going to be the most crucial step among many other things that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has been hinting at in recent days and may unveil during his budget speech on June 10.
According to sources, the next year’s budget would also be envisaging lower tax rate on the salaried class — though by a tiny margin of 1 to 1.5 percentage points — under strict directions of the prime minister to give a message that the government is at least beginning to ease burden where tax rates are too high, even if it is unable to reduce them significantly.
Sources also said that policymakers had already been working on the technical and administrative aspects of the move to support the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which has failed miserably so far to document retail businesses in a manner that could yield revenue outcomes over the past two decades, despite repeated attempts and models.
 
 

The finance minister is believed to have held at least three successive consultative sessions with the FBR, the Ministry of Petroleum, banks, financial institutions, and a few hired or co-opted consultancy firms to explore technical solutions.
The campaign against the cash-based economy would work both ways — from top-down and bottom-up — to encourage and compel both consumers and businesses to reduce costs for documented transactions and increase expenses for cash. It aims to gradually shift the economy from low-cash to eventually cashless, where technically feasible.
An official said that all petrol pumps across the country — from Chaman to Khyber and Karachi to Azad Kashmir — would be required by law to provide digital options, including QR codes, debit and credit cards, and mobile payment services, in addition to cash.
The government-notified petroleum prices would apply only to digital transactions, while cash sales would involve an additional cost of about Rs2-3 per litre.
Consumers would be free to conduct cash transactions at a higher rate, but would be encouraged to opt for digital payments instead.
“This is a regulated environment and implementable at the outset,” the official said, adding that this would also help track petroleum supplies from borders and ports to refineries and depots.
On the other hand, importers and manufacturers would have to charge a standard 18 per cent general sales tax on digital payments from their suppliers or retailers, with an additional 2pc GST applicable on sales settled in cash.
Extra cost
“If wholesalers, distributors and retailers are ready to pay higher tax and their customers are willing to absorb the additional cost, it’s their choice, but it will involve substantial finances,” an official said.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial, when approached for comment, said only: “We must move towards a cashless economy,” but declined to elaborate ahead of the budget announcement.
Sources said the new initiative might appear synonymous with the filer and non-filer categories for banking transactions — a policy that did not yield desired results given its limited scope. However, the new policy is likely to have far greater outreach, capturing even small and informal business transactions through a carrot-and-stick approach.
The Finance Bill 2025-26 would provide a piece of legislation under which every business — big or small — would be required to offer cash and digital options. The cash transaction would carry an additional tax or fee compared to digital payments.
Unlike digital options like point-of-sale systems, which involve additional expenditure in the form of POS machines, payments under the upcoming scheme will also be available through simple QR codes and other digital solutions. Countries like India, Indonesia, and Bangla­desh have reportedly achieved landmark successes in this regard.
Another official said the FBR has been unable to persuade major businesses — including event managers, jewellers, marriage halls, and many professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and beauty salons — to shift away from cash to digital solutions.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Finance Minister Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Earlier, he announced the government’s “war on cash” as part of a strategy to tap into over Rs9.3 trillion in circulation and maximise revenue potential. He has been talking about maximum utilisation of technology, end-to-end digitisation and auditing towards this end besides simplifying processes.
The finance minister also put on record some time ago that non-filers and under-filers were evading taxes of around Rs1.3tr at the individual level. “We must declare war on cash if we aspire to join the G20 (a group of major economies),” he said, adding that it was only possible when transactions are documented.
According to the minister, Pakistan’s economy was potentially valued at more than $700 billion — significantly higher than the current estimate of $410bn — leading to over Rs7tr in annual tax evasion. “We will ensure this documentation,” he promised.
On the petroleum side, the government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly last month to digitally track petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration. The practice causes massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually, besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The dual-pricing mechanism in the upcoming budget is expected to complement that legislative move and provide end-to-end traceability across the fuel supply chain.

As the HRCP report rightly underscores, Peca has morphed into a blunt instrument used to silence critics, muzzle the press and weaken fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.
From political workers to TikTokers, and even a police officer critical of the presidency, the law’s application has grown alarmingly broad and punitive. What was initially framed as a measure against cybercrime now operates more as a tool of political retribution.
 
 

The criminalisation of vaguely defined terms such as ‘false information’ and the unchecked power vested in regulatory bodies dominated by the executive mark a steady and dangerous shift towards authoritarianism — a shift that is playing out before the world even as the government pretends otherwise.
The report paints a dire picture: offences that were once bailable and non-cognizable are now treated as serious crimes. The newly created National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency lacks transparency and safeguards; and the economic intimidation of journalists, such as freezing bank accounts, is the new normal.
Nowhere is this crackdown felt more acutely than in regions already under pressure, such as Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, where connectivity is hyper-regulated and journalistic work is fraught with risk.
The state’s argument for curbing disinformation cannot be used to justify the silencing of legitimate criticism. Democracies thrive on and are underpinned by accountability, and the strength of the latter depends on the freedom to speak truth to power. Peca, in its current form, does not protect the public; instead, it protects those in power from the scrutiny of the public.
What is particularly significant in the HRCP report is the call to establish a national coalition of civil society, journalists and political stakeholders. This is not merely a procedural suggestion but a democratic necessity.
The government should seize this opportunity to open dialogue and reform repressive laws before it slides further into autocracy. Ignoring this call would be a grave misstep. The repeal of Peca is not just a legal correction, but a moral and democratic obligation. Pakistan must choose whether it wants to be seen as a nation that safeguards speech or one that penalises it.

A police spokesperson said a tip-off was received regarding the movement of militants in the area of Kot Mubarak on the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border. These suspects were reportedly spreading fear and panic among civilians at various locations.
Upon receiving the information, police teams swiftly launched an operation, cordoning off the area and initiating a targeted raid.
The terrorists, armed with heavy weapons, launched an attack on police. However, the Punjab Police responded with a timely and effective counter-operation, thwarting the terrorists’ plans.
 
 

During the encounter, four militants were shot dead while their accomplices managed to escape, taking cover of the bushes and sand dunes. The dead militants could not be identified.
Police seized weapons from the deceased terrorists. A thorough search and sweep operation is currently underway in the area to apprehend any remaining hostile elements.
The operation was conducted under the supervision of Dera Ghazi Khan, Regional Police Officer retired Capt Sajjad Hassan Khan and District Police Officer Syed Ali.
Inspector General of Punjab Police, Dr Usman Anwar, lauded the Dera Ghazi Khan police for eliminating the four terrorists, commending their bravery and swift action.

This desire seems to have grown stronger in the aftermath of Pakistan’s recent tactical military win against India as the ruling party hopes to turn the ‘feel-good factor’ in the country into wider political support for itself. The question, however, remains: can the government secure ‘concessions’ from the multilateral lender to implement its ‘relief plans’ to win over middle-class voters?
What we have seen is that the government was compelled to delay the announcement of its budget by more than a week to June 10 when the IMF mission left the country after inconclusive policy discussions on Islamabad’s budget proposals last month.
No final agreement was reached due to differences mainly on the proposed increase in defence expenditure and tax cuts for individuals and businesses.
The Fund later said in a statement that the discussions would continue virtually regarding the budget “over the coming days”, revealing some disagreement. The Fund added that the talks “focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure”.
The outcome of the ongoing virtual budget talks remains inconclusive — otherwise we would have heard from the Fund or the government that the differences had been sorted out.
The IMF feels that the government’s expenditure and tax relief proposals will hit the overarching target of the primary budget surplus — whose size determines the reduction or increase in public debt in a given fiscal year — of 1.6pc of GDP agreed upon by the two sides in policy discussions.
The lender wants the authorities to come up with credible proposals, identifying alternative sources of revenue to offset the impact of the increase in defence and other expenditures and the cuts in taxes.
The lender has valid reason to be concerned. The widening shortfall of more than Rs1tr in tax collection in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, despite the imposition of record new taxes and the blocking of tax refunds, justifies the IMF’s apprehensions.
 
 

The massive shortfall in tax recovery makes it clear that the FBR may not be able to meet even the revised collection target. The IMF had recently agreed to slash the tax collection target of nearly Rs13tr by Rs640bn for the full fiscal year.
With the Fund insisting on fortifying the primary budget surplus target against any additional expenditures and potential revenue slippages, the nation’s fiscal authorities have a formidable challenge ahead of them as they try to balance the IMF’s programme goals with the government’s growing desire to deepen the feel-good factor through some fiscal extravagance.

Local importers and exporters have been protesting against what they call the exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
A local PML-N leader said the federal government — led by his party — was not serious in addressing the protesters’ demand.
 
 

The sit-in against the revenue body entered its third day at Gulmat Nagar on Sunday.
The protesters have vowed the road connecting Pakistan with China will remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.
Thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded on both sides of the road for many hours, with long queues of vehicles seen on both sides on Sunday.
‘Economic murder’
The call for protest was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Comm­it­tee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Impor­ters and Exporters Asso­ciation; Gilgit-Nagar Cham­ber of Commerce; and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
On Sunday, people from all walks of life participated in the sit-in.
Meanwhile, various delegations of traders, scholars, civil society members from Hunza, Nagar, Gilgit and other areas joined the protesters. The protest leaders, Abbas Mir, Ebad Nagari, Muhammad Ismail and others, said thousands of protesters had been sitting on the road for the past three days but the authorities were reluctant to listen to their genuine grievances.
They lamented GB has “no industry” or employment opportunities in the private sector. The trade activity between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass was the biggest source of income for locals, they added.
They added people affiliated with this trade — transporters, shopkeepers, labourers, customs clearance agents, hotel owners, small businessmen — have been jobless for the last seven months due to the suspension of trade at Khunjerab Pass.
They said protesters have been demanding the clearance of over 240 consignments stuck at Sost Dry port for the past last seven months under a one-time amnesty scheme, as traders cannot afford billions of rupees in losses.
They said the policies of FBR and Customs at Sost Dry Port “economically murdered” locals.
They claimed that locals with border passes were not allowed to import items from China and the barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province of China has been suspended.
The traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between GB and Xinjiang under the 1985 border agreement.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within GB, the protest leaders demanded.
GB has a disputed status, yet local traders are paying all taxes and customs duties on imported goods.
Failed talks
Addressing the protesters, the president of PML-N Nagar chapter, Javed Hussain, said the federal government was “not serious in settling the issue”.
Mr Hussain, also a former member of GB Assembly, said trade policies at other ports of the country have been relaxed beca­use “people of those areas have representation in parliament”.
“GB people have been paying all taxes, yet the FBR is reluctant to clear their consignments.
He said no taxation without representation was a universal law and the people of GB were neither given representation in parliament nor exemption from taxes.
“The government of Pakistan even gave amnesty to high-profile terrorists. So, giving a one-time amnesty to clear 250 consignments after paying taxes was not a big demand,” he said
GB Home Minister Shams Lone, assembly member Ayub Waziri and other officials met the protesters and tried to convince them to end the protest. However, the talks failed to produce results.
The government delegations told the protesters that their demands were “genuine” and supported by the GB government.
They added that the issues were related to the federal government, and the chief minister has already sent recommendations to Islamabad.
Muhammad Ali Quaid, special assistant to chief minister, told the media that the GB government has no power to solve the demands of the protesters.
He said the issue will be discussed in the upcoming meeting of the apex committee, including civil and military leaders.

• Punjab minister plays down claims, says PP-52 constituents ‘expressed full confidence’ in CM Maryam
NAROWAL/GUJRAT: As the PML-N candidate seemed poised to clinch the by-election on a provincial assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin, rival candidates alleged interference by the ruling party to manipulate results with the help of the administration and police on Sunday.
The balloting remained peaceful throughout the day, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
By the time this report went to press, unofficial results indicated that PML-N candidate Hina Arshad Warraich had clinched the seat with 78,702 votes against PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhir Nashat Ghumman’s 39,018 votes.
 
 
,

In a statement, PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Ms Warraich on her victory and thanked the people of Sialkot for reposing trust in the party.
The PP-52 seat had fallen vacant after the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich about two months ago.
Apparently for security reasons, the local administration had placed containers in front of the returning officer’s (RO) office – a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the RO’s office in Sambrial.
The local administration said the containers had been present outside the office since the start of the voting process and that the office wasn’t sealed after the polling.
PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, while speaking to media persons in Sambrial, said that polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
He said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said he wanted to bring the matter to the notice of the chief election commissioner, saying it was not tolerable that alleged rigging took place during the by-election.
Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
On the other hand, PTI leader Usman Dar alleged that the PTI voters, supporters and polling agents were expelled from different polling stations by the police to favour the ruling party’s candidate. Responding to the PTI and PPP allegations, Punjab Infor­mation Minister Azma Bukhari said that the people of Punjab had expressed full confidence in Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in the Sialkot by-poll held on Sunday.
In an apparent reference to the PPP, she said even the party that got 400 votes was complaining abo­ut rigging. In a jibe at the PTI, she said that those who use words like ‘deals and NRO as weapons’ were now seeking deals themselves.
In a presser in Islamabad, the PTI accused the Punjab government and police of interfering in the by-poll, claiming that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the by-election was rigged because the Punjab government was aware that it would not be able to win without manipulating the polling. He claimed that there were a large number of people in rallies and public meetings, due to which the Punjab government was sure that it stood no chance in the by-election.
“To win the election, PTI polling agents were forcefully removed from the polling stations, and then ballot papers were stamped and polled. Workers of the PML-N were allowed to remain in the polling stations, while our polling agents were told to leave. We have video evidence of all that,” he claimed.
Sheikh Waqqas alleged that pol­ice officials were openly supporting the PML-N workers and threatening the PTI workers. He alleged that workers of PTI, who refused to leave, were beaten and thrown out of polling stations. He clai­med that the helpline of the Elect­ion Comm­ission of Pakistan had become inaccessible during the polling.

Traditionally, in the country, mechanisation was synonymous with tractorisation — simply increasing the number of tractors. However, the current phase of agricultural mechanisation is powered by a much wider array of machines, including combine harvesters, half-feed rice harvesters, rice transplanters, corn pickers, corn planters, and vegetable harvesters.
With declining commodity prices and soaring input costs, farmers’ purchasing power has significantly weakened, as reflected in the sharp decline in tractor sales in the past two years. Given that these machines are priced in millions of rupees, they are now predominantly purchased by businessmen who offer rental services to farmers at their doorstep.
Though mechanisation appears to be a natural progression for Pakistan’s agriculture sector, the recent phase has drastically reduced the demand for seasonal agricultural labour — traditionally supplied by entire rural families, including women and children. Farmers are increasingly turning to machines to save time, avoid labour-related issues, and, most importantly, reduce costs, as rental charges are often lower than those of manual labour.
One of the less-discussed drivers of mechanisation is the recent trend to increase cropping intensity — from two to three crops annually in irrigated areas — by adopting short-duration crop varieties (90–120 days). However, this shift has significantly narrowed the crop sowing and harvesting windows, making mechanisation essential, particularly for medium- and large-scale farmers. Notably, the push for higher cropping intensity is largely a response to mounting economic pressures stemming from land division over generations and declining crop profitability in recent years.

With rising mechanisation in agriculture and a slow-growing industrial sector, the wave of rural workers’ displacement may rise

Although the cultivated area of Pakistan is expanding, it is primarily under corporate farming, which relies almost entirely on mechanised systems. This reinforces the trend toward jobless growth in agriculture.
Against this backdrop, a pressing question arises: where will this displaced labour go — especially when nearly three million young people enter the job market each year, the majority of whom live in rural areas? More importantly, what is the government’s employment strategy to address this mounting challenge?
It is highly likely that a large segment of this displaced labour will seek daily-wage work or other employment opportunities in urban centres. However, the industrial sector — already grappling with high energy costs and heavy taxation — has experienced minimal or even negative growth in recent years. Many experts warn that this downward trend may intensify, as the government moves ahead with tariff reforms — under the upcoming National Tariff Policy 2025-2030 — aimed at trade liberalisation, which includes reducing customs and regulatory duties on imports.

For most unskilled workers, livestock — which made up 60.8pc of agricultural GDP in FY24, and is also exposed to trade liberalisation risks — is the only fallback

Therefore, for the majority of these displaced workers, who are largely uneducated and unskilled, the only viable fallback is the livestock sub-sector, which contributes 60.8 per cent of the agriculture sector’s GDP (FY24) and supports the livelihoods of over 80 million livestock farmers either fully or partially. Yet livestock is also vulnerable to government trade liberalisation policies.
Currently, imported skimmed milk powder and whey powder are subject to 20pc customs duty and 25pc regulatory duty. Any reduction in these duties is likely to boost imports of skimmed milk powder and whey powder, which already stood at around 11,000 tonnes (worth Rs9.2 billion) and 19,200 tonnes (worth Rs5.7bn), respectively, during FY24. Past experience indicates that the availability of cheap powder leads milk processors, confectioners, sweet makers, bakeries, biscuit factories, ice-cream makers and even informal milk sellers to mix or fully substitute fresh milk with substandard whey powder or milk powder.
This act not only compromises consumers’ health but also pushes millions of small and subsistence-level livestock farmers to the verge of devastation. Production costs have already risen sharply in recent years, while the farm-gate price of fresh milk in many rural areas remains even lower than the retail price of bottled water.
Pakistan lacks high-yielding livestock breeds that are suitable for rearing by small and subsistence-level farmers under local conditions. This factor virtually eliminates the possibility of competing on the international stage. Improving local breeds and ensuring their widespread adoption at the grassroots level is a long-term process that could take decades. Moreover, contrary to the industrial sector, such a transformation is unlikely to happen without sustained government intervention and support — something the government has consistently failed to provide, even after 77 years.
The government’s tariff reform agenda, based on the academic premise that lower tariffs will lead to short-term import surges followed by long-term export growth and job creation, in fact, fails to reflect the realities of Pakistan’s agriculture sector — especially livestock.
In conclusion, the growing wave of unemployment, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need to align the national employment policies with economic growth policies. History has shown that persistent unemployment, when left unaddressed, often fuels social and political unrest, leading to a rise in the crime rate. Therefore, employment creation must become a central pillar of national economic.

Across countries and through time, governments have insisted that their policies are designed to serve the common man. From the most advanced economies to the developing world, this narrative is persistent, and Pakistan is no exception.
Governments primarily generate revenue through taxation and borrowing. As such, their objectives should be twofold: to provide essential services and to invest in projects that expand the future tax base, reducing reliance on debt. Unfortunately, Pakistan’s public sector has not succeeded in both respects. The case of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) illustrates this dysfunction well. These entities were envisioned to serve the nation but have become financial black holes. Over the past decade alone, losses from SOEs have crossed Rs1 trillion.
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) continues to operate under a staggering financial deficit, a burden that weighs heavily on the national exchequer. It is severely overstaffed — largely due to political pressures that obstruct necessary reforms — but it is also paralysed by a systemic aversion to risk. With no incentive to make a profit and jobs being needlessly protected, innovation is stifled, and with a decision-making process designed to avoid responsibility, choices are either indefinitely delayed or doomed from the outset.
Over the past decade, PIA alone has incurred losses amounting to nearly Rs1tr, which is roughly Rs140 million, for each of its 7,000 employees. No government in the last few decades has come up with a single good reason to keep on losing this much money.

Real prosperity can only emerge when the state acts as a facilitator, not a hurdle, allowing markets and merit to drive the nation forward

Another area rife with unintended consequences is minimum wage legislation. These laws, intended to ensure a livable income, often result in the opposite. Businesses unable to afford increased wages either cut jobs or turned to automation. Ironically, the policy designed to protect workers ends up pushing them out of the workforce. The minimum wage in Pakistan has reportedly increased tenfold over the past decade. While that may seem like progress on paper, artificially high wages create inefficiencies. Industries shut down, relocate, or begin underreporting employment to bypass regulations, all of which leads to greater unemployment.
Furthermore, the government continues to allocate significant resources to the Benazir Income Support Programme, a commendable initiative on paper aimed at alleviating poverty. The amount the government spends on this programme is over a staggering Rs500 billion. What if, instead of relying so heavily on cash handouts, we spent this money preparing younger generations so that they can earn in the future?
Perhaps an even more essential question to ask is whether we’re truly preparing our citizens for a future dominated by artificial intelligence and rapid technological change? Without robust schools and accessible healthcare, do we risk perpetuating dependency rather than fostering the skills and resilience people need to thrive?
Sadly, government subsidies — particularly in agriculture and essential commodities — often miss their mark. The government provides gas at below-market prices to fertiliser companies, intending to support farmers. Yet those companies sell the fertiliser at the open-market price. As a result, farmers see little to no reduction in the price they pay, and the subsidy fails to reach its intended beneficiaries.

Attempts at collecting taxes at higher rates don’t work anywhere in the world; the result is low investment and tax evasion, though lower taxes have enabled growth, which results in a higher value being collected

The exchange rate mismanagement offers another cautionary tale. The forward rates always reflect the difference in interest rates between any two currencies. Here we debate about whether devaluing the rupee boosts exports.
If we look at interest rate comparisons between the US dollar (USD) and the United Arab Emirates’ dirham and Hong Kong dollar, these two currencies have maintained the same conversion rates with the USD for a long time. We will also see that the interest rates in these currencies are also closely pegged to the USD, whereas in Pakistan, the difference runs at around 8pc, which is what our average devaluation is over many years.
We can’t have our cake and eat it too. The outcome is simple: either we keep the rupee pegged to the USD and then also keep the interest rate the same as USD interest rates or devalue the rupee. We have experimented with artificially keeping the rupee stable against the USD; however, the math always adjusts in the end with great volatility.
To truly serve the common man, we need a shift in mindset and method. Tax reform is a critical starting point. Lowering the tax burden on individuals and businesses can stimulate economic activity, create jobs, and improve living standards. Attempts at collecting taxes at higher rates don’t work anywhere in the world. The result is low investment and tax evasion. On the other hand, lower taxes have enabled growth, which results in a higher value being collected.
Many government programmes claim to serve the common man but often fall short in practice, fostering dependency. For meaningful and lasting progress, policies must shift toward promoting economic freedom, reducing wasteful expenditures, and prioritising sustainable, inclusive growth.
Crucially, the government must also uphold the sanctity of contracts — a fundamental pillar of any functioning economy. When the state itself becomes an unpredictable party against businesses, it erodes investor confidence and turns opportunity into risk. 
Without a stable, rule-based environment, people will hesitate to invest, innovate, or build. Real prosperity can only emerge when the state acts as a facilitator, not a hurdle, allowing markets and merit to drive the nation forward. This is the only way to benefit the ordinary citizen.

In a similar spirit, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has approved a ‘recovery loss allowance’ for K-Electric, which has a monopoly over electricity distribution in Karachi.
In such an allowance, the regulator has allowed the utility to embed lack of recoveries within the electricity tariff, charged to the consumer. Effectively, for 2023-24, the regulator allowed a margin of 6.75 per cent to be recovered from consumers who are actually paying their bills.
Effectively, consumers that are being compliant and paying their bills on time are now also responsible for paying for those who are not paying their bills. Moreover, just like in Minority Report, these consumers have to pay ahead of any default, or in pre-emption of any default. It is understandable that there will be some defaults, and some margin has to be built in for the same as the cost of doing business. But the scale of the margin is what matters here.
The range of such a margin within the region, or even globally, is around 1-1.5pc of total receivables of a utility. As a utility settles its monthly electricity bills, a typical receivable cycle would be in the range of 30 to 45 days. Meanwhile, in the case of K-Electric, the same is 6.75pc of total revenue (a much higher multiple of receivables) for the first year of its multi-year tariff.

The unintended consequence of KE’s recovery loss allowance will be a class of perpetual defaults

By allowing recovery of losses that have not been incurred in advance, precedence is set wherein the incentive for a utility to achieve 100pc recovery is simply not there. It is to be noted that many utilities in Pakistan are able to achieve close to complete recoveries in other service areas. It is important to note here that such recovery allowances are in addition to allowances for theft, which are an additional 7-8pc.
Effectively, the compliant consumers are paying for theft (which can be reduced through various targeted interventions), as well as for electricity that has been delivered and billed for but never recovered. Losing around 13-15pc of revenue to theft or default and accepting the same as the cost of doing business, while other utilities are doing much better, is an absolute disservice to the compliant consumer and the taxpayer.
One must also appreciate that K-Electric privatisation was a poster child of how entities can be turned around — a phenomenal reduction in losses through management reform and tactful interventions. But along the way, within the last few years, something changed, and from being the best-performing utility, it is now among the worst out there in terms of domestic or household recoveries.
Aggregate recoveries reached a high of 96.5pc in 2022-23 and faltered to 92pc currently. Moreover, on the domestic, or household, recovery front, it dropped from 90pc to an embarrassing 80pc for the ongoing year. During the same period, the average domestic recovery rate across the country was greater than 90pc.
Such inefficiency, instead of being rectified, was further allowed to crystallise through the availability of a recovery loss allowance — a new concept that has been endorsed by the regulator. Previously, any losses and its eventual write-off required the availability of certain documents and the completion of mandatory steps. These included the requirement of a CNIC, disconnecting a defaulter connection for at least three years, ensuring recoveries through the land revenue act, and external validation through an audit.
All of these conditions have now been diluted, wherein even the requirement of a CNIC is simply not in place, and neither is there a requirement for a specialised external audit. This effectively opens up room for potential overbilling or creating a cohort of perpetual defaults that will continue to be funded by the consumer through a recurring allowance.
As of December 2024, K-Electric had over 260,000 “running defaulters”, owing around 90pc of the amount overdue. These can be deemed as problematic accounts. Effectively, the new allowance would continue to perpetually serve these problematic accounts, giving zero incentive to actually resolve the same. The 
unintended consequence of this recovery loss allowance will be a class of perpetual defaults — why bother with a recovery when the compliant consumer can cover for the same?
To put things in perspective, on average, the amount associated with this recovery loss allowance would be in the range of Rs45 billion annually, and over a period of the multi-year tariff of seven years, that may accumulate to more than Rs300bn annually. All of this exclusively added to the bills of compliant consumers.
However, it still doesn’t end here. The country has a uniform tariff regime in place, which is the mother of all inefficiencies, but that is a story for later. Due to the same, to ensure there is a uniform electricity tariff, the federal government provides a subsidy to utilities whose total cost of service is higher than the uniform tariff. In K-Electric’s case, such a subsidy is called a Tariff Differential Subsidy. Effectively, the Rs40bn annual recovery loss allowance identified earlier is paid through the public exchequer by the country’s taxpayers.
In other words, just this annual amount can unlock massive infrastructure projects for the city. Taxpayer money, or allocation from the public exchequer, needs to be used in a manner that generates the highest impact. A better use of the same allocation can perhaps be the rollout of massive infrastructure projects, like the Green Line; the construction of four state-of-the-art 500-bed hospitals; or even universal health coverage for all residents of Karachi. Every single alternate reallocation of the public exchequer is better than, say, enabling inefficiency through a perpetual recovery loss allowance.
It is understood that recovery losses are a genuine cost of business, and there are political and economic considerations, but there is a better way to manage the same. A better way would be through the creation of a loan loss reserve, wherein certain capital can be allocated through the creation of a reserve. Similarly, explicit caps need to be in place, which may be lower of a notional amount, or six months of average electricity bill per customer.
Through a conventional credit risk management process, exposure and eventually recovery losses can be constrained. Moreover, any defaulter, once hitting an exposure cap or even before that, may see their connection being disconnected. It may be considered that the default of a connection can only be covered through such an allowance once — following which it shouldn’t be allowed. The taxpayer should not be perpetually subsidising defaulters — this is moral hazard at its worst.
The lack of imagination of both the utility and the regulator to design a credit risk management framework that is efficient is appalling at best — with the solution being slapping a flat loss allowance on all consumers.
Effectively, the most inefficient way to manage the problem at hand — a classic case of misalignment of incentives when it comes to utilisation of public money. Such a thing would not happen if shareholder capital were involved, which obviously stays protected and nurtured in dollarised returns, despite glaring inefficiencies.
The taxpayer or compliant consumer should not be at the receiving end of all inefficiencies. Such has been happening for decades, but maybe there is time for change — not just in this case, but also across the board. Allocation from the public exchequer needs to be viewed through a lens of impact, rather than solving a problem by throwing money at it. The latter is the preferred route, almost always.

Though the packaging is new, it’s reflective of the broader problem in our policymaking ecosystem, which is marked by periods of absolute lull followed by everything happening at once, usually not in the most well-thought-out manner.
Luckily, the two regulators overseeing financial services, ie the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank (SBP), operate more professionally. Last week was a good reminder of this when the latter released its sandbox guidelines, an initiative that had been in the works for a couple of years, as the first draft came all the way back in December 2023.
This was a much-needed initiative from the central bank, as the SECP had launched its own sandbox more than five years ago and by now ran a number of cohorts. While the commercial uptake is yet to truly pick up momentum, it has allowed quite a few innovative businesses to experiment with novel business models such as peer-to-peer lending and real estate tokenisation, among others.
At its core, a regulatory sandbox is a controlled testing environment where startups can trial innovative products and services under relaxed regulatory conditions. Think of it as a laboratory where companies can experiment with real customers and real money, but within strict boundaries that protect consumers and maintain financial stability, which is a critical consideration when it comes to financial services since people’s funds are typically involved.

While the SBP sandbox guidelines are a welcome move for untested financial service models, their success will likely be underpinned by variables that go beyond regulation

As far as modalities are concerned, the SBP intends to run a cohort-based programme where innovators can apply with their ideas and will be assessed on the basis of innovation, customer utility, understanding of regulatory barriers and scalability, among other things. Once selected, they will enter a 180-day testing phase where the solution will be experimented with on a limited scale to identify its potential, risks etc.
In the ideal case, where testing yields success, the entity may apply for a licence to operate commercially, and if there is no existing framework, it may be issued a ‘No Objection Letter’ by the SBP until the legalities are sorted out.
Though extremely important, these are mere procedural details that an average user of financial services doesn’t really care about. For most of us, the big question is, what would the whole exercise lead to? Will we get access to a better range of financial products or improve the existing experience? And if so, what would be areas of intervention?
The SBP doesn’t really spell out any particular verticals, but it has pointed out five components under utility: increased security, accessibility (eg with a focus on the disadvantaged groups), enhanced consumer experience, reduced onboarding time, and improved price benefits. From the guidelines, the centre seems to be mulling a thematic approach, where for each cohort it will invite applications from those trying to tackle that particular problem.
For instance, over the last few years, the SBP’s main focus in digital financial services remains Raast, where the uptake of the person-to-merchant module is still relatively slow, or at least not broad-based. As far as guesses go, the theme for one cohort could be exactly this: how to increase accessibility of retail payments or improve their customer experience.
Not too long ago, it released the participation criteria for Raast, creating room for not only entities overseen by the SECP but even non-regulated ones. Fintech veteran Raza Matin reiterates this view, saying that payment initiation services providers will likely be one of the major areas of intervention. Other potential themes, according to him, are embedded finance, micro-lending and eventually the tokenisation of real-world assets. Meanwhile, Omer Bin Ahsan, the CEO of Haball, believes open banking will also be of interest, in addition to segments like decentralised finance, remittances, credit data and know-your-customer. 
While the sandbox is certainly a welcome move in providing a pathway for untested financial services models, its success will likely be underpinned by variables that go beyond just regulation. In particular, the issue of risk capital remains a serious challenge for the ecosystem, given the only asset class, ie venture capital, which was deploying funds, has seen fortunes change over the last few years. Moreover, the willingness and ability of traditional institutions to actively participate, not only in experimenting but also backing potentially scalable businesses with various forms of financing. Unfortunately, the existing evidence there is not too comforting.

• Trump’s envoy terms Hamas demand for changes to ceasefire proposal ‘unacceptable’
CAIRO: An Israeli attack near an aid distribution point in Gaza killed as many as 31 Palestinians on Sunday, local health authorities said.
The incident in Rafah is the latest in a series of Israeli attacks on aid delivery to Gaza, following the easing of an almost three-month Israeli blockade last month.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medical teams had recovered the bodies of 23 Palestinians and treated another 23 injured people near the aid collection site in Rafah.
Earlier, the Palestinian news agency WAFA put the number of deaths at 30.
Local health authorities said at least 31 bodies had so far arrived at Nasser Hospital.
Residents and medics said Israeli soldiers fired from the ground at a crane nearby that overlooks the area, and a tank opened fire at thousands of people who were en route to get aid from the site in Rafah.
Reuters footage showed ambulances carrying injured people to Nasser Hospital.
Israel’s military said in a statement it was looking into reports that Palestinians had been shot at an aid distribution site, but that it was unaware of injuries caused by military fire.
The US-based Gaza Humani­tarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid distribution sites in Rafah, denied anyone was killed or injured near its site in Rafah and that all of its distribution had taken place without incident.
But the Gaza government media office has accused Israel of turning the distribution sites into “death traps” for people seeking aid.
“We affirm to the world that what is taking place is a deliberate and malicious use of aid as a ‘weapon of war’, employed to exploit starving civilians and forcibly gather them at exposed killing zones, which are managed and monitored by the Israeli military,” it said.
Reda Abu Jazar said her brother was killed as he waited to collect food at an aid distribution centre in Rafah.
“Let them stop these massacres, stop this genocide. They are killing us,” she said, as Palestinian men gathered for funeral prayers.
The Red Crescent also reported that 14 more Palestinians were injured on Sunday by Israeli fire near a separate site in central Gaza.
Ceasefire talks falter
Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
 
 

Hamas said on Saturday it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable.”
On Sunday, dozens of Pales­tinians marched at the funeral of a Gaza doctor, Hamdi Al-Najjar, who was critically injured late in May in an air strike that killed all but one of his 10 children.
Najjar died late on Saturday.
“We could die any time, but we are still staying in our land, remaining to work to do our duty towards our people,” said Mohammed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals.
The Israeli military has confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Younis that day, but said it was targeting suspects in a structure that was close to Israeli soldiers.
The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the military had evacuated civilians from the area before the operation began.
Israel began its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as prisoners into Gaza.
Israel’s campaign has devastated much of Gaza, killing over 54,000 Palestinians and destroying most buildings.
Much of the population now lives in shelters in makeshift camps.

The call followed a rally by PM Narendra Modi in the opposition-ruled state, where CM Banerjee urged him not to exploit the sindoor, sacred to conservative Hindu women, to extract political benefit.
 
 

“You seem to be treating all Hindu women as your spouse,” CM Banerjee had said, asking the prime minister to apply the vermilion powder that depicts a woman’s married status to his wife.
Earlier, the chief minister had disallowed Yusuf Pathan, a former cricketer, from being included in the Indian squads traveling across the world to canvass support for India’s issues with Pakistan.

Amit Shah assails Mamata Banerjee over her criticism of Modi; calls for her ouster in next year’s polls

She had said it was the party’s prerogative to choose who should go. A bevy of Muslim men have been included in the diplomatic squads to showcase India’s secularism, des­c­r­i­bed as phony under Mr Modi’s watch.
On Sunday, Amit Shah launched a blistering attack on Ms Banerjee, accusing her of “stooping low” by opposing Operation Sindoor and the Waqf Amendment Act to appease the Muslim vote bank, and alleged that the Murshidabad riots were “state-sponsored”, The Hindu reported.
Addressing party leaders and workers in Kolkata, Mr Shah gave a clarion call to uproot the All India Trinamool Congress government from power in the 2026 assembly elections.
There is widespread belief that the uptick in conflict with Pakistan was timed to milk narrow nationalism for elections due in Bihar in October; that’s where Modi headed after the Pahalgam killings on April 22.
Ms Banerjee had recently accused the Centre of politicising Operation Sindoor for electoral gains.
Mr Shah alleged, without showing any evidence, that Pakistan-backed terrorists killed innocent citizens in front of their families after asking them about their religion.
Turning his attention to the Murshidabad violence that erupted during protests over the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, Mr Shah alleged that it was “state-sponsored”.
“The way a TMC minister incited the violence, it can be said that the Murshidabad riots were State-sponsored, which caused injustice to the Hindus…Mamata Banerjee’s minister abused the BSF, and the party’s leaders were standing there and encouraging the rioters,” he claimed.
“If BSF personnel had been deployed, Hindus would have been protected. It was only after BJP workers approached the high court that the BSF was finally sent in,” Mr Shah said.
The home minister also accused the ruling party of facilitating illegal cross-border movement from Bangladesh.
“The Bengal elections will not only decide the future of the State, but it is also linked to the security of the country. Mamata Banerjee has left Bengal’s borders open for Bangladeshis. Infiltration is taking place with her blessings. Only the BJP government can stop this,” he claimed.

• Hasina’s trial over ordering mass killings kicks off
• Top court overturns ban on Jamaat-i-Islami
DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday began issuing new banknotes removing images of its founding president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, whose trial on charges of orchestrating crimes against humanity also commenced in her absence.
The caretaker government, which has run the South Asian nation of some 170 million people since Ms Hasina fled last year, introduced the currency changes as it navigates a volatile political landscape.
Ms Hasina, 77, was overthrown in August 2024 following a student-led uprising.
“Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,” Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan said.
Until now, all notes featured the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971 and was assassinated in a 1975 coup.
New designs for the Muslim-majority nation include images of Hindu and Buddhist temples, historical palaces, artwork by the late painter Zainul Abedin depicting the Bengal famine, and the national martyrs’ memorial.
On Sunday, notes for three of the nine denominations were released. “The new notes will be issued from the central bank’s headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,” Khan added, noting that “other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases.” Existing notes and coins will remain legal tender.
This is not the first time banknote designs have reflected political shifts.
Initial 1972 notes featured a map, later replaced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s image during periods led by his Awami League party. When the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power, historic sites were featured.
‘Systematic attack’
Meanwhile, at the opening of Ms Hasina’s trial, prosecutors alleged she orchestrated a “systematic attack” to crush the uprising that toppled her.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 during her government’s crackdown, according to the United Nations.
Ms Hasina, in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an extradition order and rejected the charges as politically motivated.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures linked to Ms Hasina’s ousted government and her now-banned Awami League party.
“Upon scrutinising the evidence, we reached the conclusion that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” ICT chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told the court.
Mr Islam lodged five charges each against Ms Hasina, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun (in custody) and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal (on the run), including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder”.
‘Not an act of vendetta’
Prosecutor vowed impartiality, saying, “This is not an act of vendetta but a commitment to the principle that, in a democratic country, there is no room for crimes against humanity.”
Investigators have reportedly collected extensive evidence, including video footage and Ms Hasina’s phone conversations.
The prosecution alleged Ms Hasina ordered security forces to crush protesters, including directing them to open fire from helicopters, and specifically ordered the killing of student protester Abu Sayeed. They say such acts are tantamount to “crimes against humanity”.
The ICT court opened its first trial connected to Ms Hasina’s government on May 25. In that case, eight police officials face charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters on August 5, the day that Ms Hasina fled the country. Four of the officers are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
JI’s registration restored
On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-i-Islami, allowing it to participate in future elections.
The court overturned a 2013 high court order, initiated under Ms Hasina’s government, that had banned the party. “The Election Commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
The party’s lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system.” Ms Hasina had banned Jamaat-i-Islami, rivals of her father, and cracked down on its leaders. The Awami League itself was banned in May by the interim government, pending the outcome of trials against Hasina and other leaders.

Haris, playing in his 17th T20I, carted seven sixes and eight boundaries in his 107 off just 46 balls as Pakistan chased down a challenging 197-run target in 17.2 overs for their first home T20I series win in three-and-a-half years.
Pakistan won the first two matches by 37 and 57 runs at the same venue.
Parvez Hossain smashed four sixes and seven boundaries in his solid 34-ball 66 to lift Bangladesh to 196-6 in their 20 overs.
Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan for one in the first over, but Haris, whose hundred came up off 45 balls, added 92 for the second wicket with Saim Ayub and an unbroken 60 for the fourth with Salman Agha, who made 15 not out.
Ayub hit four sixes and two boundaries in his 29-ball 45 while Hasan Nawaz scored 13-ball 26 as the home batters enthralled a near-capacity 30,000 crowd at Gaddafi Stadium.
Earlier, Parvez shared a 110-run opening stand with Tanzid Hasan (32-ball 42 with three sixes and as many boundaries) after the tourists were sent in to bat.
The Parvez-Tanzid stand gave Bangladesh an ideal start for their highest T20I total against Pakistan, beating the 175-6 they made against them at Pallekele in 2012.
Towhid Hridoy, who scored 25 from 18 balls with a six and two boundaries, then added 49 for the third wicket with Litton Das, who made 22.
Fast bowlers Abbas Afridi (2-26) and Hasan Ali (2-38) were the pick of the home bowlers.</p><small>2025-06-01 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607261-pakistani-american-tycoon-confirms-he-met-imran-khan-several-times-in-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani-American tycoon confirms he met Imran Khan several times in Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>
