Pakistan and Egypt share long-standing bilateral relations. In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Last week, Pak­istan and Egypt agreed to enhance cooperation in the maritime and industrial sectors, aiming to foster joint ventures and promote their blue economies. The army chief is currently on a visit to the country.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief held a meeting with the Egyptian president at the Itihadia Presidential Palace in Cairo.
 
 

“COAS commended the Egyptian leadership for key role in the region’s peace and stability, while President el-Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s positive and proactive contributions to matters of importance for the world and Muslim ummah. Both leaders underlined the importance of coordination on matters of mutual strategic interests and strengthening people-to-people contacts,” the ISPR said.
It added that both exchanged views on bilateral relations and reaffirmed the long-standing friendship between Pakistan and Egypt.
“The meeting further acknowledged the shared history of friendly ties and the mutual desire to further broaden cooperation in all domains especially socio-economic engagement, technology and security matters.”
“The meeting concluded on a warm note, with both parties expressing confidence that the strengthened economic and security dialogue would contribute significantly to peace, stability and security in Pakistan, Egypt and the wider region,” the ISPR said.
The army chief had reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt in a meeting with its defence officials a day ago.
The army chief had also visited and laid a floral wreath on the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier and the grave of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also met the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayab.</p><small>2025-10-25 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630463-in-meeting-with-coas-egypt-president-lauds-pakistans-contributions-towards-muslim-world' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with COAS, Egyptian president lauds Pakistan's 'contributions' towards Muslim world</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Cricket Australia said the duo were walking to a cafe in Indore when they were approached by someone on a motorcycle, the news outlet added.
India are one of the two co-hosts of the ICC Women’s World Cup, along with Sri Lanka.
The players were reportedly walking back to the cafe on Thursday, the morning after Australia defeated England by six wickets in the Women’s World Cup.
CA said the duo were harassed by a person on a motorcycle, and the team had alerted police.
“CA can confirm two members of the Australian Women’s team were approached and touched inappropriately by a motorcyclist while walking to a cafe in Indore,” CA’s statement was quoted by the news outlet.
“The matter was reported by team security to police, who are handling the matter.”
Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Dandotiya was quoted as having said that the Australian team’s security officers had filed a complaint, which led to the arrest of a resident named Aqeel after an “intensive strategic operation”.
The accused has been charged under sections 74 and 78 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the official criminal code of India, relating to outraging a woman’s modesty and stalking.

Today’s meeting follows the first round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19.
The Qatar talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border — where trade is still closed — and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. The agreement reached in Doha extended an initial 48-hour truce and resulted in a permanent ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
 


According to Afghan interim administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan delegation was to be led by Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb, deputy minister at Ministry of Interior, Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.
“The remaining issues [with Pakistan] will be discussed in the meeting,” Mujahid said in a post on X last night, adding that the Afghan delegation had left Kabul for Istanbul.
 


“Pakistan looks forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye in Istanbul on Oct 25, 2025, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan and prevent any further loss of life of Pakistanis,” the new Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said at his maiden weekly media briefing yesterday.
In essence, Doha produced the political breakthrough, while Istanbul is expected to operationalise it by defining what constitutes cross-border terrorism, how violations will be verified and how disputes will be resolved.
The Istanbul round offers an opportunity to move from temporary calm towards a structured, verifiable peace framework with mechanisms for monitoring, verification and sustained dialogue through technical committees.
Turkish officials have indicated that a technical committee in Istanbul will review details of the ceasefire, inc­l­uding terrorism, migration and border security.
At the talks today, Pakistan is expected to seek concrete and verifiable commitments from the Afghan side to eliminate the threat of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from its territory, which Pakistan says uses Afghan soil to launch attacks across the border.
The agenda includes dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad plans to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing.
Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
 
 

Additional priorities will include securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.
The truce agreed in Doha has largely held, with no major terrorist attacks reported since, according to the FO.
 


“We are taking part in the second round of talks in Istanbul with the same sincerity of purpose, with the same sincerity of intent with which we participated in Doha,” Andrabi said yesterday.
“During the Doha talks, the basic focus was to stop the terrorist attacks from Afghan soil into Pakistan.
“And in order to do that, we should have a verifiable, empirical mechanism to ascertain that the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul is taking concrete actions to stop such attacks,” the FO spokesperson said.
He said the continuation of the ceasefire demonstrated the progress achieved in Doha.
“In effect, the Doha talks and outcomes were fruitful. We would like the trend to continue in Istanbul and post-Istanbul,” Andrabi added.
‘Turkiye trusted partner’
Turkiye’s deep counterterrorism experience against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its familiarity with insurgent challenges along porous borders give Ankara both diplomatic credibility and practical insight into Pakistan’s difficulties with TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Its role is further strengthened by the longstanding Pakistan-Turkiye counterterrorism cooperation, including consultations held earlier this year.
For Pakistan, Turkiye represents a trusted partner capable of designing a mechanism that both sides can rely on, shifting the peace process from ad hoc diplomacy to institutionalised peace-building.
 
 

Ibraheem Bahiss, an International Crisis Group analyst in Afghanistan, termed the meeting “quite essential”. He told AFP that monitoring “mechanisms” could involve intelligence sharing on armed groups.
“For example, Pakistan would give coordinates of where they suspect TTP fighters or commanders are, and instead of carrying out strikes, Afghanistan would be expected to carry out action against them,” Bahiss said.
But it was unclear if that would end the problem. “I’m not so hopeful that a technical mechanism will really address the fundamental drivers of this escalatory cycle,” he said.

The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital, Bangkok, according to the palace.

He made the remarks during a ceremony at the Islamabad International Airport to mark the national flag carrier’s inaugural flight from the capital to the United Kingdom (UK) after a gap of nearly five years.
Last month, the airline had received Third Country Operator approval for the UK. The development came after Britain’s Department of Transport concluded that security arrangements in the country were “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Flight operations to Manchester are resuming in the first phase, with plans to extend them to Birmingham and London in the second.
“After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Asif said.
“This success is not a coincidence, but a living testament of the government’s priorities, strong leadership, and efforts,” he said. The minister said that the country’s image suffered immensely when the national carrier faced international bans.
 






“We took it as a national challenge. The government, without wasting a single moment, empowered and provided resources to the country’s aviation bodies,” he said.
“To meet the standards of the world’s strictest aviation bodies, we completely restructured pilot training, the licensing system, aircraft maintenance, and safety protocols,” he added.
“It is a matter of great pride that we raised our standards to such a level that the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) restored its confidence in PIA,“ the minister said.
Asif also expressed gratitude to Pakistani diplomats and staff based in Britain and Europe, saying that they “presented Pakistan’s case effectively at a diplomatic level, provided evidence, and maintained continuous engagement” with the relevant authorities.
He said that their persistent efforts had enabled the national carrier to resume its regular flight operations.
“I would especially like to thank the staff of the British High Commission in Pakistan and their team leader Jane Marriott,” he said, adding that they also played a part in accelerating the process and removing obstacles.
“Their cooperation highlights the strong friendship between the two countries,” he said. The minister added that the government was committed to making PIA a profitable institution so that it could support the economy instead of being a burden.
The minister said that the flights to Manchester were an “excellent start” but the government would not stop there. “We plan that after Manchester, flights to London and Birmingham will also be started,” he said.
The minister directed the PIA management to ensure safety, punctuality and customer satisfaction. “Let us vow today to make PIA reach the status it had once achieved,” he said.
In a post on X, Asif said the restoration of flights was part of a series of measures taken by the government for the restoration of national institutions, improvement of public facilities, and the promotion of Pakistan’s image at the international level.
 






He said that the statement of the aviation minister during the PTI era “caused damage to the reputation of our beloved country, the aviation sector, and the national airline PIA, which the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has rectified”.
“The resumption of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester marks the beginning of a new era of connectivity between Pakistan and the UK, which will provide significant convenience to the Pakistani community residing there,” Asif said.
Meanwhile, Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said: “A genuine joy to wave off the first flight by a Pakistani carrier to the UK in five years. Here’s to more destinations and connections!”
 






The EASA had barred PIA from operating in EU countries in June 2020 over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near the Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers.
The ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament terming pilots’ licences “dubious”.
EASA lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28 last year. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
It should also be mentioned that the government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.</p><small>2025-10-25 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630432-pm-shehbaz-seeks-hard-answers-on-return-of-terrorism-after-ending-in-2018' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz seeks hard answers on return of terrorism after ending in 2018</strong></a><br><p>

The new global legal framework aims to strengthen international cooperation to fight digital crimes, from child pornography to transnational cyberscams and money laundering.
More than 60 countries were seen to sign the declaration on Saturday, which means it will go into force once ratified by those states.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the signing as an “important milestone”, but that it was “only the beginning”.
“Every day, sophisticated scams destroy families, steal migrants and drain billions of dollars from our economy… We need a strong, connected global response,” he said at the opening ceremony in Vietnam’s capital on Saturday.
The UN Convention against Cybercrime was first proposed by Russian diplomats in 2017, and approved by consensus last year after lengthy negotiations.
Critics say its broad language could lead to abuses of power and enable the cross-border repression of government critics.
“There were multiple concerns raised throughout the negotiation of the treaty around how it actually ends up compelling companies to share data,” said Sabhanaz Rashid Diya, founder of the Tech Global Institute think tank.
“It’s almost rubber-stamping a very problematic practice that has been used against journalists and in authoritarian countries,” she told AFP.
‘Weak’ safeguards
Vietnam’s government said this week that 60 countries were registered for the official signing, without disclosing which ones.
But the list will probably not be limited to Russia, China, and their allies.
“Cybercrime is a real issue across the world,” Diya said. “I think everybody’s kind of grappling with it.”
The far-reaching online scam industry, for example, has ballooned in Southeast Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved and victims worldwide conned out of billions of dollars annually.
“Even for the most democratic states, I think they need some degree of access to data that they’re not getting under existing mechanisms,” Diya told AFP.
Democratic countries might describe the UN convention as a “compromise document”, as it contains some human rights provisions, she added.
But these safeguards were slammed as “weak” in a letter signed by more than a dozen rights groups and other organisations.
Tech sector
Big technology companies have also raised concerns.
The Cybersecurity Tech Accord delegation to the treaty talks, representing more than 160 firms including Meta, Dell and India’s Infosys, will not be present in Hanoi, its head Nick Ashton-Hart said.
Among other objections, those companies previously warned that the convention could criminalise cybersecurity researchers and “allows states to cooperate on almost any criminal act they choose”.
Potential overreach by authorities poses “serious risks to corporate IT systems relied upon by billions of people every day”, they said during the negotiation process.
In contrast, an existing international accord, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, includes guidance on using it in a “rights-respecting” way, Ashton-Hart said.
The location for the signing has also raised eyebrows, given Vietnam’s record of crackdowns on dissent.
“Vietnamese authorities typically use laws to censor and silence any online expression of views critical of the country’s political leadership,” said Deborah Brown of Human Rights Watch.
“Russia has been a driving force behind this treaty and will certainly be pleased once it’s signed,” she told AFP.
“But a significant amount of cybercrime globally comes from Russia, and it has never needed a treaty to tackle cybercrime from within its borders,” Brown added.
“This treaty can’t make up Russia’s lack of political will in that regard.”</p><small>2025-10-25 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251418527f6422b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951157/3-suspected-robbers-killed-in-shootout-with-quetta-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 suspected robbers killed in shootout with Quetta police</strong></a><br><p>Three suspected robbers were killed in a shootout with police in Quetta’s outskirts on Saturday morning, an official said.
Saddar Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Shaukat Jadoon told Dawn.com that three armed suspects opened fire on a police patrol party in the Killi Khali area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta, within the limits of the Brewery Police Station.
“All three suspects were killed during the police’s retaliatory action,” DSP Jadoon said.
“Weapons were recovered from the possession of the dacoits,” the officer said, adding that their bodies were taken to the Bolan Medical College for medico-legal procedures.
The suspects were dacoits and were present in the area with the intention of committing a robbery, the DSP said. Further police investigation was being carried out, he added.
Last month, Sala­h­u­ddin Achakzai, a prominent tribal elder of the Achakzai tribe, was shot dead and two others were injured when arm­ed men riding motorcycles targeted them on the outskirts of Chaman.
In late August, two men were gunned down when armed men opened fire on their car near Killi Dargai on Loralai-Dera Road.

Addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad today, PM Shehabz recalled various challenges faced by the people of Balochistan. Noting that some of those challenges required financial resources, the premier recalled meetings in Lahore held ahead of the 2009 National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, which he had attended as the then-Punjab chief minister.
“I would like to mention in all humility that in Lahore, all four chief ministers were gathered together, along with their finance ministers. Three days’ marathon session went on without a break — of course, when night fell, we would go for a few hours’ rest and then gather the next morning again.”
He noted that then-Balochistan CM Aslam Raisani had conditioned the acceptance of the NFC Award on “100 per cent financial resources being added to Balochistan’s share”.
“I said Punjab is ready to contribute whatever amount is required to meet my brother Aslam Raisani’s demand, and this is what we call the true spirit of a federation and what we call four brothers living under a roof,” PM Shehbaz said.
 
 

“The question now is how to meet these challenges so that the people of Balochistan — Baloch, Pashtun and all other communities living there — should not only own Pakistan but also feel like active participants and beneficiaries of economic growth.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the issues of Balochistan “will persist tomorrow as well, but to resolve them, one thing should come first; that Pakistan is our home and we have to put out the fire together”.
During his address, PM Shehbaz highlighted that Balochistan “voluntarily joined Pakistan”, terming the event “something history will always remember in golden words”.
He noted that the province was blessed with “infinite natural resources, which run into trillions and trillions of dollars”. “But unfortunately, those great natural resources of wealth and still hidden and buried under tonnes of mud and mountains,” the premier lamented.
“Unfortunately, what has happened in the last few years, rather spanning over more than a decade, is a matter of self-introspection,” the prime minister said.
 


Throughout his speech, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for unity among the people of all provinces.
“Baloch people have always been very, very generous to those segments of society who either migrated to Quetta or were living there for ages. Pashtuns, of course, are a part of Balochistan, Punjabi migrants and then other tribes living in Balochistan too,” he asserted.
“There was complete harmony and peace existed between the early segments of society for a very long time,” the prime minister highlighted.
He further said: “When I speak of Balochistan’s brothers, sisters and children, I am not referring to any geographical division, because we are Pakistanis first, then Punjabis, Baloch, Sindhis or Pashtuns.
“What happened then that distance developed between us, and complaints and grievances came into existence even though terrorism had been completely eradicated in Pakistan in 2018,” he said, terming it a “piercing” question that needed to be answered.
PM Shehbaz went on to recall that the Regional Cooperation for Development Highway (also known as N-25), which connects Karachi to Chaman, was infamously known as the khooni road (killer highway) in Balochistan due to “accidents that occur every other day there”.
The prime minister highlighted his government’s decision in April this year to divert money saved from reduced oil prices to development projects in Balochistan by skipping providing relief to fuel consumers.
 
 

“This killer road has a [reconstruction] estimate of Rs300bn-350bn,” he said, adding that the petrol and diesel prices declined by about Rs8-10 per litre. “I calculated so it amounted to Rs180 billion per year. If I retain that, then this killer road can be turned into a road of peace.
“My sole reason for this decision was harmony, bringing together provincial affection and promoting unity […] These are the decisions through which Pakistan can definitely come out of these challenges,” the premier asserted.</p><small>2025-10-25 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630414-eight-dead-13-injured-in-two-punjab-van-truck-collisions' target='_blank'><strong>Eight dead, 13 injured in two Punjab van-truck collisions</strong></a><br><p>

The Canadian province of Ontario said it would pull the offending anti-tariff ad on Monday so that negotiations could restart, after Trump alleged that the ad misrepresented the views of fellow Republican Reagan.
 






But Trump showed no sign of backing down, saying Ontario should not have let it air during the first two games this weekend of baseball’s World Series.
Adding extra spice to the row, the World Series features a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, facing a US team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays thrashed the Dodgers 11-4 in the first game on Friday.
“Canada got caught cheating on a commercial, can you believe it?” Trump told reporters before heading on a trip to Asia.
“And I heard they were pulling the ad — I didn’t know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight,” Trump added.
After a reporter said the ad would be pulled on Monday, Trump replied: “That’s dirty play. But I can play dirtier than they can.”
 






Trump announced on his Truth Social network on Thursday that he had “terminated” all negotiations with Canada over what he called the “fake” ad campaign.
Less than 24 hours later, Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the ads after talking to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about the spiraling row with Washington.
“In speaking with Prime Minister Carney, Ontario will pause its US advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,” Ford said in a post on X.
 






‘Crooked ad’
The Canadian ad used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.
It cited Reagan as saying that “high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.
The Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used “selective audio and video” and that it was reviewing its legal options.
 






Trump said on Friday night that it was a “crooked ad”, adding that “they know Ronald Reagan loved tariffs”.
Trump and Carney are both set to be at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea on Wednesday.
But Trump said he had no plans to meet Carney.
The latest twist in relations between the United States and Canada came just over two weeks after Carney visited Trump at the White House to seek a relaxation of stiff US tariffs.
On Friday, Carney had sought to calm the situation, saying that his country was ready to resume “progress” on trade talks “when the Americans are ready”.
Canada has “to focus on what we can control, and realize what we cannot control,” he added as he headed to Asia.
Trump’s global sectoral tariffs — particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos — have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.
For now, the United States and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.
But in a speech on Wednesday, Carney said that the United States has raised “its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression”.
“Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,” Carney added, saying the process “will take some sacrifices and some time.”</p><small>2025-10-25 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251056566dd34dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951148/thailands-former-queen-sirikit-dead-at-93-palace' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s former queen Sirikit dead at 93: palace</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s former Queen Sirikit, the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch, died late on Friday at the age of 93, the palace said.
The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Throughout her 66-year marriage to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Sirikit carved a dual reputation as a fashionista and the nation’s caring matriarch — with some Western media featuring her on magazine covers and comparing her to former US first lady Jackie Kennedy.
“I had heard that she had been unwell and, given that she was in her 90s, I knew this day would come,” 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit said early on Saturday in the capital Bangkok.
“But I didn’t expect it to be today,” Sasis told AFP.
“I feel sad because she was a mother figure to the country, and now she’s gone.”
Sirikit had “suffered several illnesses” while hospitalised since 2019, including a blood infection this month, the palace said in a statement.
“Her majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away … at Chulalongkorn hospital at age 93,” it added.
King Vajiralongkorn has assigned members of the royal family to begin a year-long mourning period, the palace said.
From early on Saturday, Thai news anchors were seen wearing black during the morning broadcast, a sign of public mourning.
Her passing “marks a profoundly significant event for the Thai Royal Family and the entire nation, given her immense popularity and deep connection to the late king who remains deeply revered”, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, told AFP.
Pakistan offers condolences
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “deep sorrow” at the former queen’s passing and conveyed his condolences to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at Sirikit’s passing.
“The people and government of Pakistan join me in extending our deepest condolences to His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time of national grief,” he said.
 






‘Mother of the Nation’
King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s remarkably lengthy reign from 1946 until 2016 was bookended by World War II and the first inauguration of US President Donald Trump.
Though Bhumibol’s son inherited the throne about nine years ago, many still revere him as the nation’s most steadfast figurehead — and Sirikit as his constant companion.
She retired from the public eye in recent years as she suffered from ailing health, her privacy sealed by strict lese majeste laws that limit what can be reported about the royal family.
But in her glamorous heyday in the 1960s she mingled with US presidents and superstars such as Elvis Presley, while at home touring Thailand to visit villagers in rural areas.
She was referred to as the “Mother of the Nation” and her birthday was designated the country’s Mothers’ Day.
The reigning Chakri dynasty dates back to 1782 but the succession from King Vajiralongkorn is unclear as he has not formally named an heir.
He has seven children including five sons — four from an earlier marriage who have been officially disowned, and his 20-year-old son Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.
While the royal family is still held in very high regard by most Thais, it faced unprecedented public dissent during street protests in 2020.
Tens of thousands of young protesters took to the streets demanding widespread political reforms including changes to the monarchy — a public challenge to the royals’ status never seen in Thailand before.
Though Thailand’s constitution places the monarchy above politics, Sirikit drew public attention when she attended the funeral of a royalist protester in 2008.
When her husband King Bhumibol died, Thailand observed a year-long mourning period.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital Bangkok, according to the palace.</p><small>2025-10-25 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2510274717ed5dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951017/lahorites-breathe-most-polluted-air-in-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahorites breathe most polluted air in world</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore was declared the world’s most polluted city on Friday as a hazardous blanket of smog enveloped the metropolis, prompting authorities to issue a severe public health warning.
The crisis was quantified by alarming data, with the city’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching a “hazardous” level of 362.
The situation was even worse in specific neighbourhoods, with the Shalimar area recording a staggering AQI of 690, followed by Shadman at 611 and Syed Maratib Ali Road at 609.
 
 

Other areas, including Iqbal Town, Lower Mall, and the Civil Secretariat also registered levels falling in the “emergency range”, posing serious health risks to the residents.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast no immediate respite, warning that a thick layer of smog is likely to persist over eastern Punjab, with a further increase expected in the coming days.

Met Office sees no immediate respite

The department explicitly identified industrial pollution and vehicle emissions as the primary drivers of smog and highlighted that children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions are at the highest risk of respiratory illnesses.
In response to the escalating crisis, Punjab’s Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb says the government is following a comprehensive strategy to combat the environmental emergency.
Smog could severely disrupt daily life and businesses, she warned.
 






“For the first time in Punjab’s history, a ban has been imposed on the use of plastic bags,” Ms Aurangzeb says.
The minister stresses the need for the people’s cooperation in combating smog, stating, “Air pollution cannot be controlled without public cooperation.”
 
 

She says that brick kilns across the province are being shifted to cleaner zig-zag technology, a dedicated “Smog War Room” has been established for Punjab, and a helpline set up for the public to report environmental violations.
Furthermore, she says that the government has launched a public awareness campaign for a clean environment and it is the collective responsibility of the people to eliminate the causes of smog and keep the atmosphere clean.
Health experts appealed to residents of Lahore to take all necessary precautions such as wearing masks and limiting outdoor exposure as the city continues to grapple with the suffocating haze.
Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-25 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25093858d71db1e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951056/committee-formed-to-probe-asps-mysterious-death' target='_blank'><strong>Committee formed to probe ASP’s mysterious death</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A three-member committee has been constituted to probe the death of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Adeel Akbar, who died from a bullet wound under unexplained circumstances in Islamabad.
A police spokesman told Dawn that the committee comprises deputy inspectors general (DIGs) of police and is headed by director general of Islamabad Safe City Authority, DIG Headquarters Haroon Joya. Other members include DIG Operations Jawad Tariq and DIG Security Atiq Tahir.
The committee was formed under the directions of the inspector general of police (IGP) Islamabad, with instructions to submit its report within 48 hours. It has been tasked to determine the facts surrounding the death of ASP Akbar, who was serving as Superintendent of Police (SP) Industrial Area Zone and to establish whether it was an accident, suicide, or murder, as well as to identify the possible causes and motives.
Police officers, speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, said the committee will also summon a doctor for questioning regarding his social media and press statements claiming that the ASP had visited him at Pims and his private clinic and had shared personal information.

Three-member panel given 48 hours to submit report; sources say police not ruling out accident, suicide, or foul play

According to the officers, Mr Akbar was on his way to the Establishment Division and had spoken to an officer he was scheduled to meet.
 
 

However, the officer informed him that he was not in the office, after which Mr Akbar asked his driver to take a U-turn near the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, the late officer’s operator informed him that an officer from the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) wanted to speak with him and sent him a message. Mr Akbar last spoke with the PAS officer regarding a professional matter and said he would ask the station house officer about it.
The officers said the late officer had recently been transferred to Islamabad from Balochistan and had expressed security concerns. A week ago, he had received a new official vehicle and had its windows fully tinted.
He had also inquired about the official weapon issued to his staff, citing security concerns. His operator informed him that he had an SMG (submachine gun), which Mr Akbar asked to see.
The operator removed the magazine and checked the chamber before handing it to him. Akbar then asked about the magazine and the number of bullets. The operator replied that he had 50 bullets and handed him the magazine on his request.
A short while later, as the vehicle reached Jinnah Square near the Serena Hotel underpass, the driver and operator heard a gunshot. They found Akbar slumped in his seat with a bullet wound to his forehead.
The operator immediately informed police communications, stating that “SP City took the weapon from us and shot himself near Serena.”
A team from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency later visited the scene, examined the vehicle and weapon, and collected samples. His mobile phone was recovered from the vehicle and has been taken into custody to be handed over to the FIA for forensic examination.
Mr Akbar had recently been shortlisted for a Fulbright Scholarship and had received the official letter on October 6. He was scheduled to appear for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) on Friday (October 24).
The officer’s driver and operator have been taken into protective custody and are being kept at a police building in I-9.
 






The incident has not yet been registered in any police record, including the daily diary. Further legal action will be taken in light of the committee’s inquiry report.
According to police officers, the incident appears to be accidental, as Akbar was supposed to meet an officer regarding his promotion shortly before his death. He was reportedly anxious about his promotion but was also actively pursuing the Fulbright scholarship, had scheduled his TOEFL test, and had sent his academic degrees for verification, indicating that he was focused on his career and personal growth, with no apparent signs of suicidal intent.
He had also spoken normally to a PAS officer just minutes before the incident. When the gunman handed him the SMG, Akbar had followed normal safety procedures to ensure there was no bullet in the chamber, the sources said. “There is a possibility that while inserting the magazine and holding the weapon upright, it accidentally discharged,” they said.
The angle of the gunshot was measured at 65 degrees between the eyebrows. Experts noted that it is extremely difficult to commit suicide with an SMG, as individuals typically place such weapons under the chin.
The officers said that while the evidence suggests an accidental discharge, other possibilities cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the investigation remains open, they added.

The regulations, introduced through BPRD Circular No.1 of 2025, had mandated streamlining of account opening and customer onboarding processes by all institutions under the SBP’s regulatory ambit, including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs. As per the circular, issued on July 25, all SBP-regulated entities (REs) need to “streamline the account opening/customer onboarding process and improve the customer experience”.
One of the new requirements introduced was that biometric verification of the account or wallet operator should be made the primary verification method for all accounts and digital wallets. The prevailing system had allowed operators to take up to 60 days to complete biometric verification before a debit block was imposed on their account.
With the new regulations going into effect starting October 25, industry sources expressed fears that potentially tens of millions of account-holders who have not completed biometric verification could lose the ability to operate them. They also expressed concerns that the regulations may prevent individuals operating foreign currency accounts from sending or receiving remittances.
Financial institutions were given three months to comply with the requirements, which are part of customer due diligence and onboarding-related requirements under the SBP’s Anti Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism/Counter Proliferation Financing Regulations.
The scope and applicability of the SBP’s regulations pertaining to digital accounts and wallets had been expanded in the ‘Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework’ introduced in July, and the change now “covers both in-branch and remote onboarding, and is applicable for opening accounts/wallets for Individuals and Entities (legal persons/arrangements), including Local Currency and Foreign Currency accounts, and explicitly mentioning Roshan Digital Accounts” and applies to all “SBP Regulated Entities (REs), including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs”.
The new framework also requires a “consolidated approach”, regardless of whether the onboarding process was performed in-branch or remotely. In the earlier framework, released in 2022, use of NADRA Verisys was allowed for verification at the time of account opening, while biometric verification was to be completed within 60 days.
However, under the 2025 framework, biometric verification will be the primary method for “customers with CNIC/NICOP/POC/ARC/POR cards prior to establishment of the relationship/opening of the account/wallet”.</p><small>2025-10-25 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630391-house-help-living-a-millionaires-life-arrested-in-karachi-for-theft' target='_blank'><strong>House help living 'a millionaire's life' arrested in Karachi for theft</strong></a><br><p>

The incident marks the second kidnapping of labourers in the region in four days. The first incident took place three days earlier, although it was only made public by the officials yesterday.
Levies officials said over two dozen armed men stormed the camp and crushing plant of a private construction company late on Thursday in the Naal area, about 80 km from the district headquarters of Khuzdar.
“They set at least eight vehicles and other machinery on fire and took away workers with them [to an] unknown destination,” a senior Levies force official in Naal said.

Assailants also set ablaze many vehicles; incident comes days after gunmen abducted nine labourers in Mastung

The company manager, Zulfiqar Ahmed, said the attackers initially took 20 people.
 
 

“The armed men kidnapped 20 labourers from the camp but two of them were freed later on their way to an unknown destination,” Mr Ahmed said. He confirmed that the abducted workers belong to the Sindh.
The labourers were working on a road project for the D. Baluch construction company, which is building roads to connect Naal with the areas of Washuk and Basima. Officials said that at least eight vehicles were completely gutted and other machinery was damaged in the attack.
Security forces have launched a search operation in the area to find the kidnapped workers and the armed group responsible.
In the previous attack, unidentified gunmen kidnapped nine labourers as they were returning home from their work on an under-construction building site. The assailants also hijacked the pickup truck in which the workers were travelling, all at gunpoint in the Dasht area of Mastung district.
No one has claimed responsibility for either of the recent kidnapping incidents.

The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans.
The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said.
 



Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump

The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump.
Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”.
“The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said.
“It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re,” he added.
 


In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said.
 






“Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement.
 






In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi.
“He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.”
The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil.
The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation.
It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call.
Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.

• Lawmakers demand parity in police salaries with other provinces
• CM Bugti proposes committee to review legislators’ pay and perks
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday adopted two resolutions, calling for the inclusion of the province’s major development projects in the second pha­se of the China-Pakistan Eco­no­mic Corridor (CPEC) and for the upgradation of Margha Kabzai to the status of a sub-division.
The house also discussed making the salary structure of Balochistan Police equivalent to that of other provinces. In addition, a proposal was referred for review to the Finance Committee regarding an increase in the salaries of assembly members.
Soon after the session started, which was presided over by Spe­aker Captain (R) Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the Emir Jamaat-i-Is­l­ami Balochistan, Maulana Hid­a­yatur Rehman, through a call-attention notice, drew attention to the disparity in salaries of Ba­­lochistan Police personnel compared to other provinces.
He said the police had rendered countless sacrifices for maintaining peace in the province, yet their salaries remained significantly lower than those of other provincial forces, leading to frustration among the ranks.
 
 

Responding to the notice, Provincial Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani acknowledged the issue and assured the House that the government would take necessary steps to bring police salaries on par with other provinces.
Later, Dr. Muhammad Nawaz Kabzai of JUI-F presented a resolution urging the government to grant tehsil status to Margha Kabzai, a backward area with a population of around 110,000 comprising the Babbar, Sherani, Khosti, and Kabzai tribes.
He said that despite its geographical importance, Margha Kabzai had long been neglected, and residents were forced to live without essential services. The resolution called for immediate administrative action to declare the area a sub-division. After a brief discussion, the House unanimously approved the resolution.
In another significant move, Maulana Hidayatur Rehman presented a resolution demanding that Balochistan be included in CPEC Phase-II projects. He said that while billions of dollars have already been spent under the CPEC framework, the people of Balochistan had not reaped any tangible benefits.
He criticised the federal government for excluding the province from the ongoing CPEC Phase-II initiatives. “We do not seek charity in the name of fuel savings. We are proud Baloch and Pashtuns who only demand our fair share in CPEC,” he said.
Supporting the resolution, BNP-Awami MPA Mir Asadullah Baloch stated that had CPEC been implemented properly, the province would not be facing security challenges today.
 
 

During the session, National Party MPA Kulsoom Niaz Baloch raised a point of order suggesting a review of lawmakers’ salaries and perks. Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai responded that after Punjab, the Balochistan Assem­bly members already receive the highest salaries in the country.
JUI-F’s Shahida Rauf raised concerns over the recent abduction of 18 labourers in Khuzdar, pointing out that 27 workers had been kidnapped in Balochistan within a week.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, while addressing the House, proposed that lawmakers’ salaries should be reviewed and brought in line with those of Punjab Assembly members. He suggested forming a committee to examine the matter, which the speaker accepted, directing that the issue be referred to the Finance Committee for detailed consideration.

In his dissenting note on the court’s judgement issued in a case pertaining to the killing of Mohammad Hayat Mirza, a Karachi University student, in Turbat, Justice Minallah said that there can be “no tolerance” for such acts and conduct by law enforcement agencies and their members.
In 2020, police arrested a soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), Shadiullah, on charges of killing Mirza and started an investigation after registering a case against him. The case was registered against the suspect on the complaint of Mohammad Murad Baloch, the brother of the deceased.
The convicted had appealed to the SC following his sentencing by a trial court. The trial court, in a judgment on January 20, 2021, convicted the appellant under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and he was sentenced to death.
 
 

However, the SC issued its 2-1 majority verdict on Shadiullah’s plea on September 17, 2025, a written order for which was issued yesterday. According to the verdict, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
The ruling was issued by a three-member bench comprising Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan, and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, among whom Justice Minallah dissented.
“In a society where grievances relating to enforced disappearances, use of excessive force, abuse of power, extra-judicial killings and violation of fundamental rights by law enforcement agencies are widespread, impunity in case of crimes committed against the citizens becomes the most aggravated form of transgression of law,” Justice Minallah stated.
“The gravity intensifies when a citizen falls victim to aggression by a law enforcement agency or its officers and members,” he said. “Any such act or conduct is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution.”
Justice Minallah said that the rule of law is “eroded” when law enforcers take the law into their own hands and “arrogate to themselves the role of a judge
and an executor”, adding that the appellant had abused his position of
authority and trust.
“The officers and members are provided weapons and ammunition
for the exclusive use to protect the people and to serve them in their best
interest,” he said in his note.
“As a uniformed disciplined force, each officer and member of the FC Balochistan is presumed to be highly trained and that each would demonstrably display high standards of professionalism and exemplary conduct at all times while dealing with the civilian population for whose
benefit they have been entrusted with onerous duties and obligations,” he stated.
Deterrent punishment, he said, is not only to maintain a balance between the gravity of wrong done by a person but “also to make the offender an example for others as a preventive measure for reformation of the society”.

The case, which centred on alleged vote buying at its 2023 leadership primary, is one of a growing number of prosecutions targeting the Republican People’s Party (CHP) that critics say are politically motivated.
The lawsuit sought to overturn the result of the primary that elected Ozgur Ozel and could have ousted him as party leader.
It was thrown out by the court on the grounds that one of the complainants was ineligible to file the lawsuit and that the basis for the case had become moot since the CHP had since held a fresh vote, re-electing its leadership.
 
 

The verdict triggered applause from spectators, among them a Ummu Gulsun Seyfi, 75, a party stalwart since 1977, who accused the government of political meddling “instead of dealing with people’s problems”.
Onur Yusuf Uregen, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the result was a “surprise” and vowed to appeal.
Although the full decision has not been released, CHP lawyer Ali Yigit Koca told AFP that the judge understood that subsequent party leadership elections meant there was no basis for the case.
“The fact the CHP held an extraordinary congress in April must have convinced the judge to declare the procedure moot,” he said. The CHP held another leadership congress in September.
Ozel, who was reelected at both meetings, hailed the decision. “On one side, there is the government targeting democracy and seeking to eliminate the ballot box, on the other, the democrats who fight against it,” he said at CHP’s headquarters.

“This meeting of mine had been planned quite a while ago, and the American side did not cancel it, despite a number of recent unfriendly steps. We will continue the dialogue,” Dmitriev said.
US President Donald Trump hit Russia’s two biggest oil companies with sanctions this week to press the Kremlin leader to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Trump spoke to Putin last week and said he planned to meet Putin soon, but Trump later cancelled that summit, saying it could take place another time.
“The Russia-US dialogue will continue, but it is certainly only possible if Russia’s interests are taken into account and treated with respect,” Dmitriev said.
 


He declined to say who he was meeting and predicted that the US oil sanctions would backfire.
“They will only lead to gasoline costing more at American gas stations,” said Dmitriev.
Citing sources with knowledge of the visit, CNN reported earlier on Friday that Dmitriev was expected to meet Trump administration officials  “to continue discussions about the US-Russia relationship”.
 
 

Axios reported that Dmitriev would meet Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff in Miami on Saturday. The state TASS news agency quoted Dmitriev as saying he would also meet other people he did not name.
Dmitriev, who has developed a good working relationship with Witkoff, declined to say whether arrangements for a new Trump-Putin meeting would be on the agenda of his talks.

• Sugarcane output estimated at 84.7m tonnes, rice at 9.4m tonnes
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has set a wheat production target of around 30 million tonnes for the Rabi season 2025-26, banking on adequate water availability in Punjab and Sindh — the two main wheat-producing provinces.
The wheat production target for the Rabi season 2024-25 was set at 27.92m tonnes, but the government exceeded it by achieving 28.42m tonnes.
The target for 2025-26 was approved at a meeting of the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), which also finalised the wheat policy to ensure farmers receive fair support prices, enabling them to cover production costs and earn reasonable profit margins, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Friday.
In light of recent floods, the FCA recommended launching a campaign for early wheat sowing, ensuring the availability of quality certified seed of improved varieties through a track-and-trace system, timely and affordable fertiliser supply, and the proper use of herbicides. It also called for wider dissemination of production technology through electronic and print media, greater access to agricultural credit, and bringing cultivable and barren wastelands under wheat cultivation through corporate farming.
 
 

Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, who presided over the FCA meeting, said the policy reflects the government’s commitment to safeguarding farmers’ interests and achieving self-sufficiency in staple food commodities.
Production targets for other Rabi crops were fixed at 393,000 tonnes for gram, 8.916 million tonnes for potato, 2.788m tonnes for onion, and 659,000 tonnes for tomato. The committee also reviewed seed availability for Rabi crops.
The director general of the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department informed the meeting that the availability of certified seed for Rabi 2025-26 will remain satisfactory.
Regarding water availability, the Irsa Advisory Committee anticipated no shortage of water for Punjab and Sindh during Rabi 2025-26, allocating 33.814m acre-feet (MAF) of water to the provinces.
 
 

The Meteorological Department informed the meeting that below-normal precipitation is expected in most parts of the country during November and December, while near-normal rainfall is likely in January 2026.
The committee emphasised the use of new wheat seed varieties for improved production, suggesting the sowing of drought-tolerant and rust-resistant varieties, and the development of high-yielding, heat-tolerant varieties in response to climate change. It also called for strengthening provincial seed production systems and building farmers’ capacity to produce and maintain pure seed varieties.
The FCA highlighted the need to prevent curtailment of agricultural land to ensure maximum cultivation area and urged the use of innovative technologies, such as those developed by Suparco and the Land Information and Manag­ement System, for production forecasting and better planning. The committee also stressed the adoption of climate-smart agriculture techniques.
The meeting was informed that sugarcane production for 2025-26 is provisionally estimated at 84.7m tonnes from an area of 1.146m hectares, showing an increase of 5.5 per cent in area and 5.9pc in production over FCA targets.
Rice production for 2025-26 is estimated at 9.417m tonnes from an area of 3.039m hectares, indicating an increase of 21.9pc in area and 2.7pc in production compared to targets. Mungbean production is estimated at 150,800 tons. The availability of certified wheat seed for Rabi 2025-26 will meet 44pc of the total requirement.
 
 

In line with the government’s agenda to promote the agriculture sector, the minister appreciated the State Bank of Pakistan’s efforts to enhance agricultural credit flow. The SBP has set an indicative agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs2.572 trillion for fiscal year 2025 — 16.3 per cent higher than the preceding year’s Rs2.250tr.
Currently, 47 financial institutions are providing agricultural loans, including five major commercial banks, 13 medium-sized private banks, six Islamic banks, two specialised banks (ZTBL and PPCBL), 11 microfinance banks, and 10 microfinance institutions or rural support programmes.
During FY25, lending institutions disbursed Rs2.577tr, achieving 100.2pc of the annual target and recording 16.3pc growth compared to Rs2.215tr disbursed in the corresponding period last year. The committee was also informed that the supply of urea and DAP fertilisers is expected to remain stable during the upcoming Rabi season.
The minister reiterated the government’s resolve to ensure food security through coordinated federal and provincial efforts. He said farmers are the backbone of the country’s progress, and their prosperity remains a top government priority.
He also underscored the importance of timely policy implementation, impr­oved irrigation management, mechanisation, and greater investment in research and development to ensure sustainable agricultural growth.

Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added.
“The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn.
The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing.
The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border.
 
 

The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country.
Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border.
However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today.
‘Customs staff ready’
Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal.
The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan.
The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15.
An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations
Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement.
At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents.
With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations.
Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade.
In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added.

• Calls for allowing KP CM Afridi’s meeting with Imran Khan
• KP’s Kundi says his office will play role of bridge between Centre and province
PESHAWAR: Punjab Gov­ernor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan on Friday said the alliance between his PPP and the PML-N was a political “compulsion” rather than an act of affection, aimed at maintaining political stability after the 2024 general elections.
“At least two parties had to join forces for the formation of the government,” he added while addressing a press conference with his Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa counterpart Faisal Karim Kundi at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
The Punjab governor noted that the alliance serves the country’s interests. “Pakistan is our top priority,” he added.
Mr Khan conceded that party workers from both sides were finding it difficult to accept the alliance.
 
 

“The PPP’s inclusion in the government was borne out of necessity, not choice, and it has come at a political cost for our party,” he said, warning that even a minor irresponsibility could derail the system.
Mr Khan further said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had assured the PPP that its concerns would be addressed soon, even though PML-N leaders had admitted they could not meet several commitments.
CM’s meeting with Imran
The Punjab governor also said that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
“There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, politicians should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question.
He also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government.
“You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added.

He said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support.
The Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it.
‘Role of bridge’
Speaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder.
“I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings.
He said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods.
“My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.”
While talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.”
He said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan.
Mr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.

• First Barelvi group to be declared proscribed
• Rana Sana claims TLP was created to ‘steal PML-N votes’, rules out negotiations
• Tanzeemat Ahl-i-Sunnat raises concerns over mosque takeovers
• SIC chief rejects ‘politics of violence’ under Barelvi banner
ISLAMABAD: With the government’s ban on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) now in force, the once-influential religio-political group finds itself increasingly isolated as, unlike after the previous ban in 2021, no major religious or political party has come forward in its defence this time around.
The Ministry of Interior on Friday formally notified the ban on TLP, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal was ratified by the federal cabinet.
The notification, SRO 2011(1) of 2025, highlighted that the TLP has been declared a proscribed organisation under Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and placed on the Act’s First Schedule.
The party may appeal to a review committee comprising officers of the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Interior within 30 days.
The National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) has issued an advisory to all provinces, law enforcement agencies, the banking sector, the Election Commission and other stakeholders regarding restrictions applicable to entities listed on Schedule I.
 
 

These include sealing party offices; curbs on promotional material (literature, posters, banners, printed and digital content); a bar on press statements and press conferences; financial sanctions and prohibitions on financial support; and limits on political and social activity.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed on Friday that the TLP was “created in a bid to cut into PML-N’s vote bank”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose. The group “was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”, he said.
However, he denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
The TLP has become the third religio-political party, and the first from the Barelvi school of thought, to be declared proscribed. It’s also the first political party to be proscribed twice, as it was briefly banned in 2021 by the PTI-led government. That ban was lifted after the party reportedly pledged to renounce violence.
Asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, Mr Sanaullah said, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
On a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA” and maintained that “the party cannot take part in any elections”.
 
 

Earlier bans under the ATA have targeted groups across the spectrum. Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and Tehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) were banned in 2002. Both had sympathisers in political and religious circles.
TJP remained part of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) as well as the Milli Yakjehti Council (MYC). The SSP, with support largely within Deobandi networks and some former militant groups, later saw one of its leaders elected to the National Assembly.
By contrast, no major religious group from any of the country’s four main sects, nor any political party, has publicly extended support to the TLP following the latest decision.
One reason no group is backing the TLP is that most political and non-political organisations seem hopeful that the leaders and workers of the banned group would now join their original parties that they belonged to before 2015.
Mosques sealed
Following the announcement, the Punjab government moved to seal and take over mosques linked to TLP supporters.
Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, member of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) and part of the first official negotiating team in 2021, opposed any move that would obstruct prayers.
Social media speculation suggested that mosques linked to Barelvi adherents might be handed over to Deobandi administrators. However, Mr Ashrafi later clarified that no such transfer would take place.
The Tanzeemat Ahl-i-Sunnat Pakistan — an umbrella body of almost all political and non-political groups of the Barelvi sect, but which the TLP never joined — raised concerns over mosque takeovers. Senior leader Mufti Gulzar Naeemi said they suspected the Punjab Auqaf Department’s actions.
“After negotiations with the Islamabad administration and other districts of Punjab, all sealed mosques have been reopened for prayers, and where prayer leaders had gone into hiding, replacement clerics have been appointed by the Auqaf Department in consultation with Tanzeemat,” Mufti Naeemi said.
TLP’s leadership originally belonged to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). The late Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi founded TLP in 2015, primarily focusing on issues related to the honour of the finality of Prophethood.
SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza said, “We have always objected to the politics of violence from any platform belonging to the Barelvi school of thought because it will be more harmful for the whole nation compared to the benefits achieved out of that struggle.”
In 2021, prominent figures Mufti Muneebur Rehman, businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi (AKD) and Saylani Welfare Trust Chairman Bashir Qureshi acted as guarantors for the TLP in talks that led to the lifting of the earlier ban.
However, Mufti Muneeb has remained silent after the latest ban. Sources said Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi recently met Mufti Muneeb and reminded him of the October 2021 undertaking that TLP would not take the law into its own hands or challenge the writ of the state.
Mr Ashrafi told Dawn that the TLP had “constantly violated its own commitments” and alienated senior clerics by “harassing or misbehaving” with them.
“They ridiculed everyone who tried to pacify them; that is why nobody wants to speak on their behalf now,” he said.

Yesterday, the religiopolitical party was banned by the federal cabinet. In the 2018 general elections, the TLP was estimated by political analysts to have cost the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) at least 15 closely contested national seats across Pakistan. The party secured nearly 2.2 million votes, mostly from Punjab and Karachi, during the elections.
Earlier today, the interior ministry notified a ban on the TLP, saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism, after nationwide TLP protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Rana Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose and went on to quip that “it was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”.
However, the premier’s advisor denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
“I am not in a position to talk on behalf of the cabinet,” he said, expressing optimism that the decision to dissolve the party will be made.
When asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, citing TLP’s 2021 ban and its subsequent lift, Sanaullah responded, saying, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
He stressed that “any party, whether political, religious, or academic, involved in terrorist activities is liable to be banned under clause 11b of the Anti-Terrorism Act”.
In response to a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA”, and maintained that “the party can not take part in any elections while it is still banned under the ATA.”
Detailing the next steps following the ban, he said, “Now that the government has notified the ban, within the next three days, all these grounds will now be sent to TLP for review, after which it will have 30 days to file an appeal in a high court via a writ jurisdiction”.
However, he clarified that the ban on the party “stands within the review period and also during the appeal period,” emphasising that “there is no space for accommodating the party”.
On the matter of potential dissolution, he elaborated that, “the first step here is the review and then the appeal”.
“How will a party that has been banned act as a political party? If their offices and assets have been sealed, how will they function?”
According to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,”  according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.
The TLP was formed in 2015 out of a protest campaign seeking the release of Mumtaz Qadri, a police constable who had assassinated the former governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, in 2011 over his calls to reform the blasphemy laws and release Asia Bibi, who had been accused of blasphemy. Qadri was later executed.
The group founded a political party at Qadri’s funeral in 2016, which was attended by thousands of people.</p><small>2025-10-24 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24220009a516c65.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950991/palestinian-factions-agree-to-hand-gaza-to-technocrat-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian factions agree to hand Gaza to technocrat committee</strong></a><br><p>The main Palestinian political factions, including Hamas, said on Friday they had agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of post-conflict Gaza.
During a meeting in Cairo, according to a joint statement published on the Hamas website, the groups agreed to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent technocrats”.
It said the committee would “manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.
The statement also said the factions had agreed to work on unifying a common position “to confront the challenges facing the Palestinian cause”.
It called for a meeting of all forces and factions to “agree on a national strategy and to revitalise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people”.
Hamas is not part of the PLO, which is dominated by its longtime rival Fatah.
An informed source told AFP on Thursday that delegations from Hamas and Fatah met in Cairo to discuss the second phase of a US-backed ceasefire plan in Gaza.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that both sides agreed to “continue meetings in the coming period and to work on organising the Palestinian internal front in the face of the challenges posed by the Israeli government”.
Alongside the Hamas-Fatah talks, Egypt’s intelligence chief Hassan Rashad met senior officials from key Palestinian factions.
They included Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, as well as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine — both factions within the PLO.
Hamas and Fatah have a history of deep political rivalry, which flared into fighting for a time after a 2006 election, and which has hindered efforts at Palestinian national unity.
In December 2024, they agreed to create a committee to jointly administer post-conflict Gaza. The agreement was criticised, particularly by members of Fatah.
Hamas, which seized power in the territory in 2007, has already made it clear that it does not wish to govern the post-conflict territory, but has pushed back against the insistence that it disarm its fighters.
Rubio seeks quick deployment of international Gaza force
Separately, top US diplomat Marco Rubio voiced hope of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza.
The secretary of state visited Israel on the heels of Vice President JD Vance as part of an all-out effort by the United States to persuade both Hamas and Israel to respect the truce.
Rubio said it was critical for the deal to create “the conditions for the stabilisation force to come in as soon as it possibly can be put together”.
He expressed optimism for a durable end to the two-year Gaza conflict as he met Israeli, US and other Western forces monitoring the ceasefire from inside a vast converted warehouse in southern Israel.
The deal, spearheaded by President Donald Trump, calls for an international force to oversee security after Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas.
In Gaza, families were still trying to find their way back to their ruined homes — in many cases only to find they lie in areas controlled by Israeli forces beyond the so-called “Yellow Line”.
“Some young men from our family risked their lives, they went to inspect the destruction in our area, and told us that my house was destroyed,” said 42-year-old Hani Abu Omar, a displaced Palestinian speaking to AFP at a tented encampment in Al-Zawayda.
“All my life I’ve been working, earning, and doing everything I can to build a house.”
 
 

Israel’s campaign in Gaza since October 2023 has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands homeless and hungry.
Fighting has died down since the October 10 ceasefire, but aid flows are still restricted and Gaza is divided between Hamas territory in the ruined cities and a wide band of land outside the Yellow Line still held by Israel.
The arrival of an international security force may unlock reconstruction funds — US officials vow none will go to Hamas-held areas — but the troop-contributing countries have yet to be confirmed.
Rubio confirmed that Israel would enjoy vetoes on the force’s composition, amid reports Israel has objected to Turkiye’s participation.
“There’s a lot of countries that have offered to do it. Obviously as you put together this force, it will have to be people that Israel is comfortable with,” he said.
Turkiye, a Nato member and one of the region’s strongest militaries, was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel.
But, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it has welcomed Hamas leaders and been a vociferous critic of Israel, which Erdogan accuses of committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority state, has said it is ready to send troops to Gaza.
The United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, has already been involved in ceasefire monitoring.
Rubio said the US may seek a UN mandate for the force, as some countries need the world body’s imprimatur to deploy troops.
But he again rejected any future role for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has banned from its territory.
Some 200 US soldiers have deployed to the Civil-Military Coordination Centre, where uniformed troops from a dozen countries were seen mingling in the hastily-assembled rented space.
Overhead screens showed the staff’s latest findings, including what it said was a new abundance of fruit, vegetables, cheese and coffee getting into Gaza.
Another projection showed the day’s schedule and ended with words from Trump that read like a motivational saying: “A new and beautiful day is rising. And now, the rebuilding begins.”
The Trump administration has been increasingly firm with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in March brushed aside an earlier ceasefire and ordered a major new offensive.
Netanyahu has sought to downplay any perception of tension with the US, his most crucial military and diplomatic backer.
Israel is still waiting for Hamas to return the remains of 13 of 28 dead hostages it promised to hand over.
Hamas said today it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye that “the war has effectively ended”.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630317-ihc-grants-police-one-week-extension-to-locate-missing-nccia-official' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants police one-week extension to locate missing NCCIA official</strong></a><br><p>
