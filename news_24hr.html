Kahuta Police Station House Officer (SHO) Zakaullah Shah told Dawn.com: “ Fifteen-year-old Sania Bibi, daughter of Muhammad Waris, a resident of Kahuta town, had gone missing from her home the previous day, while her body was found lying in Lang Nullah in the Rawat area on Wednesday morning.“
Shah said that her body was transported to Kahuta Tehsil Headquarter Hospital for a postmortem to ascertain the cause of her death.
The SHO further added that her family had told the police that she was mentally ill and had left her home barefoot.
“They were searching for her and she probably jumped into the ravine. Her body was recovered miles away in the Rawat area, at the bank of the nullah,” the SHO said.
The official added that all aspects of her death would be investigated after receiving postmortem reports.
Last month, the prime suspect in the Arshman Akhtar murder case was killed in an alleged encounter with the police.
Four-year-old Arshman Akhtar’s body was found in a pond in Rawat in November last year after going missing from a wedding.
Also in July, a man allegedly gunned down his 16-year-old daughter over her refusal to delete her TikTok account in the limits of Rawat police station.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/062344528aebccf.jpg?r=234735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929112/pakistan-women-lose-by-11-runs-in-first-ireland-t20' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan women lose by 11 runs in first Ireland T20</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan lost by 11 runs to Ireland on Wednesday in the first Twenty 20 International (T20I) of their series in Dublin.
Skipper Fatima Sana was the pick of the bowlers for the Green Shirts at the Clontarf Cricket Club Ground, getting a career-best 4-26 as the team looked to kickstart a packed international calendar — featuring two white-ball World Cups — with a winning performance after bowling the Irish side out for 142.
However, that was not meant to be, as the Irish side restricted the visitors to 131 in their chase, with all-rounder Orla Prendergast being adjudicated player of the match for her three wickets and 26 runs.
In the first innings, Sadia Iqbal, the number one ranked T20I bowler in the world, started her spell by conceding a boundary to Ireland opener Amy Hunter.
 






Skipper Fatima struck in just her second over, bowling an inswinger to dislodge her opposite number Gaby Lewis’s middle stump.
The Irish side then recovered to score 48-1 at the end of the powerplay — courtesy five boundaries from opener Hunter.
Left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu came into the attack to bowl the seventh over, conceding just five in her first over.
She got the breakthrough in her next over — removing Hunter for 37 when the Irish batter was bowled round her legs while attempting to sweep, and the ball crashed into her stumps.
At the halfway mark of the innings, the Irish side were meandering along at 70-2 before Prendergast and left-handed Leah Paul got together at the crease to try to up the momentum.
 






However, it wasn’t meant to be as Rameen Shamim got the next wicket for the Green Shirts when Prendergast tried to sweep her — only to top-edge the ball to a gleefully waiting Fatima at short fine leg. The Karachi-born spinner broke the partnership just before the Irish innings got going again.
Paul was the next to fall for Ireland, top edging a shot off Sadia to be caught at long-on after scoring a brisk 28 off 19. The Pakistani skipper then returned for the 17th over to claim two more Irish wickets.
Ireland continued to lose regular wickets, with Fatima bowling Jane Maguire with a yorker in the penultimate over of the innings.
Pacer Diana Baig got her first wicket in the 20th over of the Irish innings, with the Irish team getting bowled out for 142 after losing their last two batters to runouts.
The Pakistani reply did not get off to the best of starts as they lost southpaw opener Muneeba Ali for just 5 when she hit a Prendergast delivery straight to mid-off.
Her fellow opener Gull Feroza could also not last for long at the crease — getting bowled by pacer Jane Maguire for five in the fourth over of the innings.
Veteran bat Sidra Amin — Pakistan’s leading run scorer in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers earlier this year then steadied the ship with the hard-hitting Aliya Riaz.
Both batters, who had top-scored for the Green Shirts in a victory in their previous encounter against the Irish side in the Qualifiers in Lahore, fell in quick succession to soft dismissals.
Ava Canning and Cara Murray got the wickets of Sidra and Aliya respectively in the 8th and 9th over of the innings to leave the visitors reeling at 42-4.
Debutant Eyman Fatima combined with Natalia Pervaiz at the crease to bring up Pakistan’s 50 in the 11th over of their innings.
Eyman subsequently got run out in a stroke of bad luck when Natalia hit a full toss back towards Murray, who got a hand to the ball before it crashed into the stumps.
Skipper Fatima was the next batter at the crease, getting going from the get-go by hitting a boundary off Murray — only to be given out caught behind in the next over by spinner Lara McBride.
The Pakistan captain made her disapproval of the decision well-known before exiting the field, not getting a chance to review as the decision review system was not available.

Natalia tried to up the rate with a brisk 34 partnership with Rameen before she fell to a straightforward length delivery by Prendergast.
Despite some resistance by Rameen till the penultimate over, Pakistan still fell short of the below-par target by 11 runs.
This is the fifth bilateral T20I series between the two sides. The record so far stands even, with both Pakistan and Ireland having won two series each. However, the overall head-to-head is tilted heavily in Pakistan’s favour, with the visitors winning 15 of the 19 encounters since their first meeting in Dublin in 2009 going into the match.
The series follows a productive month of preparation for Pakistan, who held a 17-day skills camp and a five-day pre-tour camp at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre in Karachi before arriving in Dublin on August 3.
Ireland, meanwhile, entered the series high on confidence after a dominant showing against Zimbabwe women last month, where they swept both the T20I and ODI series at home.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06230330b65c1f4.jpg?r=230417' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929128/rescue-operation-underway-after-emerald-mine-collapses-in-kps-malook-abad' target='_blank'><strong>Rescue operation underway after emerald mine collapses in KP’s Malook Abad</strong></a><br><p>A major rescue operation was launched in the Malook Abad area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district after a section of an emerald mine collapsed on Wednesday evening, trapping multiple workers underground.
According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.
“Upon receiving the alert, the district emergency officer immediately dispatched a specialised disaster response team to the site, where a full-scale rescue operation was launched without delay,” said Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul.
Gul confirmed that four mine rescuers entered the collapsed shaft, working to reach and retrieve the trapped individuals.
“Rescue efforts were being carried out with urgency, utilising all available resources including modern equipment, ambulances and medical teams stationed at the site,” she said, adding that additional support has been requisitioned from nearby mines and emergency units to expedite the operation.
“We are doing everything in our capacity to ensure a safe and successful rescue,” Gul said, adding that Swat District Emergency Officer Rafiullah Marwat also reached the site of the incident and would personally supervise the operation.
Eyewitnesses and local workers, however, expressed concern over the lack of scientific methods and safety measures traditionally employed in such mining operations, according to a Dawn.com correspondent at the scene.
“These emerald mines are being run in an entirely unscientific and unregulated manner,” local resident Abid Ali Jan told Dawn.com, adding that safety protocols are often neglected in pursuit of profit.
Mining in Swat’s lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at serious risk.
“We have even reported that some residents located in the same mountain, closer to the mine, carry out illegal mining and they have made the land beneath many houses shallow,” said Ihasanullah, a resident of Malook Abad near the mine. “Despite the complaints, the authorities do not take action against them.”
The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.
Rescue teams continued the operation, while anxious family members and locals gathered near the site.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0622560121deb76.jpg?r=231014' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929127/pakistans-social-sector-adapts-to-survive-global-aid-cuts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s social sector adapts to survive global aid cuts</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration’s abrupt decision to terminate foreign aid, including funding through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), delivered a jolt to Pakistan’s social sector, forcing many organisations to halt projects, lay off staff, and scale back operations.
Days after beginning his second term in January, Trump announced a pause in all foreign assistance under his “America First” policy. The move further deepened an already challenging funding environment in Pakistan, where donor fatigue and shifting priorities have chipped away at global aid streams in recent years.
Still, the development sector has managed to absorb the initial shocks. Experts say a shift in strategy, bolstered by growing support from the Pakistani diaspora and government contributions, has helped NGOs keep their work alive.
“Pakistan’s decades-old development sector, particularly the big NGOs, is deep-rooted and is pursuing a multi-sectoral and multi-donor approach to avoid dependence on one or a few donors,” said Naseer Memon, an Islamabad-based social sector expert.
Although USAID was not the only donor for development initiatives, its sudden withdrawal disrupted several key health, education, and community welfare projects, Memon told Anadolu.
 
 

However, local NGOs adapted quickly by diversifying their funding sources and relying more on domestic and diaspora-based support to avoid a full collapse.
European nations, too, have funded programmes focused on religious harmony and democratic governance, particularly during the post-9/11 ‘war on terror’, helping broaden the country’s donor landscape, Memon added.
Restructuring and resilience
Another factor that has helped local NGOs, according to Memon, is government funding for a slew of social sector projects.
One major recipient of USAID funds, the Sindh Rural Support Organisation (SRSO), was forced to shut down three health projects after the funding freeze — two of which were in full swing and one just getting started.
Mohammad Dittal Kalhoro, SRSO’s head, said his organisation had to let go of several staff members, but almost 90 per cent were re-employed within months through project restructuring and cost-cutting.
“We either retained or re-hired employees [affected by USAID cuts] for other projects where we had some cushion, or new projects that we launched later,” Kalhoro told Anadolu.
One of the previously halted projects was restored by USAID in June, enabling further rehiring and expansion, he added.
Diaspora stepping up
Increasingly, NGOs are relying on funds from the Pakistani diaspora. More than eight million Pakistanis live abroad, mainly in the US, Europe and the Gulf states, and send home over $30 billion in remittances each year.
This financial lifeline is now helping charities and NGOs complete health, education, and water-related projects, particularly in underserved rural areas, Memon said.
Ali Mohsin, a Pakistani-Canadian engineer, has been raising funds for an eye hospital in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dir district. Between 2012 and 2024, Canadian Pakistanis helped complete 12 major projects in health, education, and clean water, while another 10 are underway this year alone, said Mohsin, who works with the Al-Khidmat Foundation.
Umair Idris, a director at the foundation, also emphasised the importance of diaspora funding, saying that 35pc of the charity’s budget now comes from overseas Pakistanis — a 10pc increase from 2020 levels.
The Citizens Foundation, which runs a network of more than 2,000 schools nationwide, has also seen soaring diaspora support.
“Previously, we would receive 30pc of our overall funding from overseas Pakistanis,” Mushtaq Kassim Chhapra, the organisation’s founding director, told Anadolu.
“This share has jumped to around 40pc to 42pc over the past few years, particularly because they (overseas Pakistanis) have confidence and trust in our work.”
Global aid decline
The strain on Pakistan’s social sector is part of a larger global trend. Trump’s freeze on US aid, long the world’s largest donor pool, triggered similar budget cuts from other countries, leaving the international development community scrambling.
The Geneva-based Global Fund recently announced it would slash $1.4bn from previously approved grants, citing uncertainty about donor commitments.
Memon noted that Pakistan’s aid flow had already been declining due to the country’s 2015 foreign funding law, intended to regulate international grants and prevent money laundering. While the law was meant to boost transparency, many NGOs found it burdensome, further deterring foreign donors.
The government, for its part, said the law was necessary to check the sources and objectives of foreign funding into Pakistan.
New global crises have also diverted attention and resources. Wars in Ukraine, Sudan, and, most recently, Gaza]4 have drawn donors’ focus elsewhere. Despite these challenges, experts agree that Pakistan’s development sector has shown surprising resilience in navigating a new era of constrained international support.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06225720036f5c3.jpg?r=230617' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929115/govt-can-consider-pardon-if-imran-issues-apology-pms-coordinator-says' target='_blank'><strong>Govt can consider pardon if Imran issues apology, PM’s coordinator says</strong></a><br><p>Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Industries Rana Ihsan Afzal has said that the government would be able to consider a pardon for PTI founder Imran Khan if he were to issue an apology for his crimes.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
In an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ a day ago, Afzal said Imran’s sentence could be commuted if he were to issue a written apology to the president.
“If he writes some mercy petition or an apology to the head of state, then in my opinion, his sentence can definitely be forgiven,” Afzal said.
“The scope available in the law can be used. Besides this, the government does not have any other power to forgive his sentence,” he said, adding that as the allegations against Imran had been proven, a pardon could be considered based on an apology.
He emphasised that the sentencing in the wake of the May 9 riots did not mean that the “doors were shut” for dialogue.
“The most important thing in politics is that there is no enmity between political parties,” he said, stressing the importance of being able to sit down and have conversations about the national agenda.
However, he alleged that Imran was responsible for the current atmosphere of political polarisation that he termed as a “shortcoming in the current political space”.
“Other political parties are able to have conversations; they can sit together and talk about national issues,” Afzal said, adding that the PTI alone refused to engage in inter-party dialogue.
 


Meanwhile, PPP Secretary-General Nayyar Bukhari said the government had the authority to end Imran’s sentence on a constitutional basis.
“The state can bring cases and can also withdraw them. This authority lies with the state,” he said.
“Pakistan’s head of state has the authority to grant forgiveness. This is in the Constitution, right?” Bukhari said, adding that the state had the power to withdraw a case against anyone according to the Criminal Code.
He stressed, however, that this could only happen with dialogue, saying, “If this dialogue does not happen, then where will the relief come from?”
 


Yesterday, police personnel detained PTI protesters in Lahore and Karachi after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of the ex-premier, who has been in jail for two years now.
However, the party leadership failed to hold any major gatherings in Rawalpindi and Islamabad as part of its campaign to secure Imran’s release, as police arrested dozens of party workers, including women, as they attempted to hold rallies at various locations in the capital.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0617463958c53c5.jpg?r=181104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929110/search-underway-for-2nd-day-after-karachi-couple-drowns-in-skardu-boat-capsize-accident' target='_blank'><strong>Search underway for 2nd day after Karachi couple drowns in Skardu boat capsize accident</strong></a><br><p>A search operation for a missing body continued for a second day after a couple from Karachi drowned in a boat capsize accident in Skardu, officials said on Wednesday.
Skardu is a popular tourist destination for local and international visitors. However, accidents are quite common due to the difficult terrain and lack of modern infrastructure.
A statement by Rescue 1122 said, “Two people went missing in a tragic boat capsizing incident in the beautiful Kachora area of Skardu. Rescue 1122 divers and rescue personnel of Skardu have recovered the body of a woman after taking immediate action, while the search for the other missing person is still ongoing.
The search and rescue operation was ongoing under the supervision of Emergency Officer Islamuddin, it added.
Baltistan Police Public Relations Officer Ghulam Muhammad told Dawn.com that a family from Karachi, who were visiting the Kachura Soq Valley in Skardu, had been rafting on a river when the raft capsized at 4pm on Tuesday.
“Three operators and a 15-year-old boy survived, while the body of a woman has been recovered and shifted to the Combined Military Hospital Skardu,” he said, adding that a search operation was underway to locate the body of her husband.
Out of the three operators, one was a local and two others were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said. “The boat operators have been arrested for investigation over negligence,” he added.
In June, four people drowned while one child remained missing after a boat carrying tourists capsized in the Shahi Bagh lake in the Kalam area of KP’s Swat.
On May 16, four tourists from Gujrat went missing between Gilgit and Skardu. They were subsequently located at the bank of the Indus River near Istak village in Skardu’s Roundu valley.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06195241e9bca85.jpg?r=210728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929114/enforced-disappearances-other-issues-fuelling-public-alienation-political-instability-in-balochistan-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Enforced disappearances, other issues fuelling public alienation, political instability in Balochistan: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”. The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In a press release issued today, the HRCP said: “The mission’s findings reveal a disturbing pattern of continued enforced disappearances, shrinking civic space, erosion of provincial autonomy and unchecked impunity — conditions that continue to fuel public alienation and political instability.”
The mission observed that the state’s framing of the issue “risks normalising what international human rights law considers a crime against humanity”, it said, adding that the report called for independent investigations into alleged reprisals against those who spoke up against enforced disappearances.
While stating that terrorist attacks on ordinary citizens, including non-Baloch settlers, were “indefensible and must be prosecuted”, the HRCP called the passage of the Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act, 2025, “deeply problematic”.
“The law permits 90-day detentions without meaningful judicial oversight, raising concerns about the potential for torture and abuse,” the HRCP said, urging the government to withdraw the act and ensure compliance with human rights obligations in all counterterrorism efforts.
Citing the report, the press release said that electoral manipulation and political sidelining of nationalist parties had “severely undermined public trust in democratic processes”.
“The mission recommends that the state ensure transparency, fairness and accountability in all electoral processes by investigating credible allegations of rigging and depoliticising administrative structures to avoid further political disaffection,” it added.
It continued, “The mission has called for the demilitarisation of civilian law enforcement and for a unified civilian police force with adequate resources and training in community-based, rights-compliant policing to replace the current overreliance on paramilitary and military forces.”
 
 

The HRCP urged the state to “publicly affirm” the role of human rights defenders and guarantee their protection, stating, “The report also underscores the delegitimisation of civil society movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), observing that equating human rights advocacy with militancy only deepens alienation, especially among the youth.”
It also called on the government to reinstate constitutional protections under the 18th Amendment and respect provincial autonomy in natural resource management, while highlighting “controversial projects such as Saindak and recent amendments to the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act”.
The HRCP further said that the state must initiate a “transparent, inclusive and rights-based political solution” to prevent the political and security conditions in Balochistan from deteriorating.
“Importantly, the mission notes that the risk of ethnic reprisals beyond the province is real and growing, threatening national cohesion, and accordingly calls for principled leadership rather than further securitisation,” it added.
 






The report
The report looked at the scale and impact of media censorship and threats to journalists, “including violence, intimidation, and restrictions on news coverage”, and the consequences of internet shutdowns, university closure and other restrictions on civic life and access to information, it said.
The fact-finding mission aimed to assess the scale of “enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary detentions, particularly of activists, students and members of the BYC” and examine the alleged repression of rights-based movements and peaceful protest, including the use of anti-terrorism and preventive detention laws against non-violent activists and demonstrators, the report said.
 
 

The report termed the issue of enforced disappearances as the “most urgent and widespread human rights concern” and said that the testimonies from political leaders, civil society actors and law enforcement officials highlighted the “scale, impunity and evolving character of this practice”.
It stated, “Accounts suggest that the phenomenon, far from being isolated or exceptional, has become systematic, thereby undermining the rule of law and severely eroding public trust in state institutions.
“A key theme that emerged was the shift in the pattern of enforced disappearances from prolonged incommunicado detention to allegations of an increasingly common ‘kill-and-dump’ approach.”
Citing data provided by the police, the report said that there were 356 reported cases of enforced disappearances, 116 people were traced, 36 were removed from records due to incomplete information, 12 individuals were killed in police encounters and 192 cases remained unresolved.
In 2025, the Balochistan police registered 46 new cases of enforced disappearance, it said, adding that around 1,300 individuals among the 5,000 reported by Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal were said to have been “recovered”.
 
 

The report said that the victims’ families and friends continued to face “harassment, intimidation and denial of justice” when attempting to report such cases or raise public awareness.
“In multiple cases, family members say they were followed, subjected to surveillance, and in some instances detained or denied professional credentials,” it added.
HRCP highlighted the state’s perspective on enforced disappearances, stating that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti “acknowledged” that the issue was a concern, but “attempted to reframe the issue as a ‘complex’ and ‘contested’ one”.
“Bugti further argued that militant groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army were also responsible for abductions, although such claims could not be independently verified by the mission,” it said.
The report quoted Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail as saying, “disappearances happen when insurgencies take place”, stating that this framed them “as a byproduct of conflict rather than as a violation of fundamental rights”.
Respondents from the Balochistan High Court, meanwhile, argued that amendments to the act mirrored developments in the now-merged Federally Administered Tribal Districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: detention for “90 days without an FIR, under the pretext of ‘aid of civil power’”.
“They (respondents) expressed concerns that this would violate the right to due process and protection against arbitrary detention and custodial torture,” the report reads.
Key observations
The mission noted with concern that state narratives had framed enforced disappearances as part of the broader conflict in Balochistan, which “risks normalising what is considered a crime against humanity in international human rights law”.
According to the HRCP’s report, state lawmakers had “implied” that efforts for dialogue were postponed in the wake of an attack on non-Baloch citizens; a reflection of a broader pattern in which security goals overshadowed political resolution.
“Despite the finality of the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict in the Mohabbat Shah case (December 2013) — which explicitly identified the involvement of state elements in enforced disappearances and directed the government to ensure accountability — there has been little meaningful progress in implementing these directives,” the report read.
“The failure to act on the court’s findings reflects a broader pattern of impunity and lack of political will to hold security agencies accountable, thereby undermining both judicial authority and victims’ right to justice,” it added, noting that allegations of enforced disappearances must be taken seriously and investigated.
HRCP noted the increase in militant violence in Balochistan, but warned that amending the Anti-Terrorism Act would be “counter-productive to curbing militancy and crime”.
“Rather, the law is likely to further erode due-process protections, particularly in the absence of judicial oversight, and increase resentment among residents of Balochistan,” the report read, noting that it remains unclear whether those detained have access to their families or legal counsel.
“The mission notes that despite the state’s claims that it has enforced its writ through administrative control and legal reforms, significant structural, institutional and political deficits continue to hinder effective law enforcement and civilian oversight in Balochistan,” the report added.
The report expressed particular concern over the delegitimisation of human rights defenders such as Dr Mahrang Baloch and other BYC members, warning that “tarring (violent) militancy and (peaceful) advocacy with the same brush is likely to further alienate Balochistan’s population and particularly its youth”.
It added that “unless it (the state) urgently seeks an enduring, transparent and inclusive political solution to Balochistan’s legitimate grievances, the ongoing insurgency will remain difficult to quell.”
Recommendations
The HRCP recommended that enforced disappearances should be brought to an immediate end, urging the implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and domestic legislation against the practice passed in 2022.
 
 

“Disband the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which has failed to hold accountable those responsible for such practices (despite having the prosecutorial powers to do so), and instead establish a new commission with effective leadership and a fresh mandate to prosecute any state elements found responsible for perpetrating enforced disappearances,” it added.
The report also recommended ensuring a transparent and fair electoral process and investigating allegations of electoral manipulation, stating that such actions would restore faith in democratic governance.
HRCP also recommended withdrawing the Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act and reviewing all security-related legislation to ensure it lines up with international law and human rights standards.
“Guarantee due process and judicial oversight in all instances of detention and dismantle any form of indefinite or arbitrary detention,” the report recommended.
Noting that internment centres were replicated from those in KP, the report urged the state to decide pending appeals against the Peshawar High Court judgment on detention and formally notify these detention facilities as sub-jails.
Additionally, the HRCP urged that all individuals involved in militancy and crime be held accountable through transparent judicial processes in line with national laws and international human rights standards.
“The state must replace extrajudicial and opaque measures with credible, impartial investigations and fair trials, thereby reinforcing the rule of law and demonstrating the state’s commitment to justice and accountability,” the report recommended.
The report also recommended reinstating constitutional guarantees of provincial autonomy under the 18th Amendment, particularly regarding resource and minerals management, as well as demilitarising the province to create conditions that would enable meaningful dialogue.
“In the first instance, this could take the shape of a high-level national truth and reconciliation commission to promote interprovincial trust and reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to a federal and inclusive democracy,” the report read.
The report also recommended integrating Category A and B areas under civilian police control, ending Balochistan’s reliance on paramilitary bodies such as the Levies for law enforcement. It also urged the state to provide civilian police with equipment and training to perform their duties in line with human rights standards.
The HRCP additionally urged the state to cease actions against human rights groups, recommending that these groups be protected and treated in keeping with international human rights commitments. Additionally, the report recommended that the state act against those posing as polio workers who harass human rights defenders.
“Engage constructively with peaceful voices — even when they are critical of state policy — to foster a culture of democratic dialogue,” the report recommended.
“Immediately halt state interference, financial coercion and intimidation of media outlets and journalists,” the report recommended. “Ensure freedom of expression by facilitating unrestricted media coverage of human rights issues, public protests, and criticism of state policies, consistent with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”
The report also recommended opening the border crossings with Iran and Afghanistan to facilitate cross-border trade and reduce unemployment, while urging the state to halt the deportation of Afghans.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/062202333db88c5.jpg?r=220506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929126/xs-policies-sparked-anti-muslim-anti-migrant-narratives-after-southport-attack-report' target='_blank'><strong>X’s policies sparked anti-Muslim, anti-migrant narratives after Southport attack: report</strong></a><br><p>The design and policy choices of X created fertile ground for inflammatory and racist narratives targeting Muslims and migrants following last year’s deadly Southport attack in the United Kingdom, a new analysis showed on Wednesday.
According to research published by Amnesty International, social media platform X played a “central role” in the spread of false narratives and harmful content, which contributed to riots against Muslim and migrant communities in Britain.
The technical analysis of X’s open-source code or publicly available software showed that its recommender system, also known as content-ranking algorithms, “systematically prioritises” content that sparks outrage, provokes heated exchanges, reactions and engagement, without adequate safeguards to prevent or mitigate harm.
“Our analysis shows that X’s algorithmic design and policy choices contributed to heightened risks amid a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-migrant violence observed in several locations across the UK last year, and which continues to present a serious human rights risk today,” said Pat de Brun, head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International.
 
 

Far-right riots broke out across the UK following the stabbing attack by Axel Rudakubana in Southport on July 29 last year. The violence was fuelled by false online claims that the suspect, who is a British citizen born in Cardiff, Wales, was a Muslim asylum seeker.
Amid false claims circulating on social media platforms, many mosques, Islamic buildings, and hotels housing migrants were targeted across the country.
Algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing potential for causing harm
According to the research, as long as a post drives engagement, the algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing the potential for causing harm, “at least not until enough users themselves report it”.
“These design features provided fertile ground for inflammatory racist narratives to thrive on X in the wake of the Southport attack,” it added.
The study also noted that an account on X called ‘Europe Invasion’, known to publish anti-immigrant and Islamophobic content, posted shortly after news of the attack emerged that the suspect was “alleged to be a Muslim immigrant”.
It noted that the post garnered over four million views and within 24 hours, all X posts speculating that the perpetrator was Muslim, a refugee, a foreign national, or arrived by boat, were tracked to have an estimated 27m impressions.
Saying that the Southport tragedy occurred in the context of “major policy and personnel changes” at X, the study pointed out that since Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022, X has laid off content moderation staff, reinstated previously banned accounts, disbanded Twitter’s Trust and Safety Advisory Council, and fired trust and safety engineers.
Numerous accounts that had been previously banned for hate or harassment, including that of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right figure better known as Tommy Robinson, were also restored.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0619142073b110c.jpg?r=200557' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929120/us-envoy-witkoff-meets-putin-for-3-hours-as-trumps-sanctions-deadline-nears' target='_blank'><strong>US envoy Witkoff meets Putin for 3 hours as Trump’s sanctions deadline nears</strong></a><br><p>United States envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Wednesday, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by US President Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.
Witkoff flew to Moscow on a last-minute mission to seek a breakthrough in the three-and-a-half-year war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian state TV showed a brief clip of him shaking hands with Putin at the start of their meeting.
Russian news agencies said the talks ended after about three hours, and Witkoff’s motor convoy was seen leaving the Kremlin.
Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who earlier greeted Witkoff on arrival and strolled with him in a park near the Kremlin, posted on social media: “Dialogue will prevail.” There was no immediate statement from either side on the substance of the talks.
 






Later, Trump called the meeting “highly productive” in a post on Truth Social.
“Great progress was made!” the US president wrote. “Afterwards, I updated some of our European allies. Everyone agrees this war must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come.”
 


A White House official said that the meeting went well, adding that Washington still planned to proceed with secondary sanctions on Friday.
“The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States. The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday,” the White House official said.
Trump, increasingly frustrated with Putin over the lack of progress towards peace, has threatened to impose heavy tariffs on countries that buy Russian exports.
He is exerting particular pressure on India, which, along with China, is a huge buyer of Russian oil. The Kremlin says threats to penalise countries that trade with Russia are illegal.
It was not clear what Russia might offer to Witkoff in order to stave off Trump’s threat.
Bloomberg and independent Russian news outlet The Bell reported that the Kremlin might propose a moratorium on air strikes by Russia and Ukraine — an idea that was mentioned last week by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during a meeting with Putin.
Such a move, if agreed, would fall well short of the full and immediate ceasefire that Ukraine and the US have been seeking for months. But it would offer some relief to both sides.
Since the two sides resumed direct peace talks in May, Russia has carried out its heaviest air attacks of the war, killing at least 72 people in the capital Kyiv alone. Trump last week called the Russian attacks “disgusting”.
Ukraine continues to strike Russian refineries and oil depots, which it has hit many times.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that Russia had attacked a gas pumping station in southern Ukraine in what he called a deliberate and cynical blow to preparations for the winter heating season.
Russia said it had hit gas infrastructure supplying the Ukrainian military.
Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Zelensky, said on Wednesday that a full ceasefire and a leaders’ summit were required. “The war must stop and for now, this is on Russia,” he posted on Telegram.
‘Last-ditch effort’
Putin is unlikely to bow to Trump’s sanctions ultimatum because he believes he is winning the war and his military goals take precedence over his desire to improve relations with the US, three sources close to the Kremlin told Reuters.
“The visit of Witkoff is a last-ditch effort to find a face-saving solution for both sides. I don’t think, however, that there will be anything of a compromise between the two,” said Gerhard Mangott, an Austrian analyst and member of a group of Western academics and journalists who have met regularly with Putin over the years.
“Russia will insist it is prepared to have a ceasefire, but [only] under the conditions that it has formulated for the last two or three years already,” he said in a telephone interview.
“Trump will be under pressure to do what he has announced — to raise tariffs for all the countries buying oil and gas, and uranium probably as well, from Russia.”
 
 

The Russian sources told Reuters that Putin was sceptical that yet more US sanctions would have much of an impact after successive waves of economic penalties during three-and-a-half years of war.
The Russian leader does not want to anger Trump, and he realises that he may be spurning a chance to improve relations with Washington and the West, but his war goals are more important to him, two of the sources said.
Putin’s conditions for peace include a legally binding pledge that Nato will not expand eastwards, Ukrainian neutrality, protection for Russian speakers and acceptance of Russia’s territorial gains in the war, Russian sources have said.
Zelensky has said Ukraine would never recognise Russia’s sovereignty over its conquered regions and that Kyiv retains the sovereign right to decide whether it wants to join Nato.
Witkoff, a real estate billionaire, had no diplomatic experience before joining Trump’s team in January, but has been simultaneously tasked with seeking ceasefires in the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, as well as negotiating in the crisis over Iran’s nuclear programme.
Critics have portrayed him as out of his depth when pitched into a head-to-head negotiation with Putin, Russia’s paramount leader for the past 25 years, and at times accused him of echoing the Kremlin’s narrative.
In an interview with journalist Tucker Carlson in March, for example, Witkoff said there was no reason why Russia would want to absorb Ukraine or bite off more of its territory, and it was “preposterous” to think that Putin would want to send his army marching across Europe.
Ukraine and many of its European allies say the opposite. Putin denies any designs on Nato territory, and Moscow has repeatedly cast such charges as evidence of European hostility and “Russophobia”.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617643-pakistan-starts-deporting-registered-afghan-refugees-says-unhcr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan starts deporting registered Afghan refugees, says UNHCR</strong></a><br><p>

Upper South Waziristan Police spokesperson Shoaib Mehsood told Dawn.com: “According to the initial information, unknown assailants attacked DC Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle when he was travelling to Maken area from Ladha.”
He said the DC, additional DC (ADC) for planning and development, a police constable and an assistant to the ADC for finance and planning were aboard the vehicle.
The police spokesperson said that DC Wazir and the ADC remained safe in the attack, but the assistant for the finance and planning ADC and Constable Gul Nawaz were injured.
He said that the injured were taken to the district headquarters hospital for medical treatment.
The spokesperson said a police team was sent to the area and was conducting a search to track down the armed assailants.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Last week, armed men abducted a truck driver and two labourers while setting their vehicle on fire in the Ladha area.
A police spokesperson said unidentified assailants intercepted a truck near Habib Kot, a suburb of Ladha.
Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were killed in a clash between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in Dana area of Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-08-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617616-mobile-internet-service-suspended-across-balochistan-over-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet service suspended across Balochistan over security concerns</strong></a><br><p>

The ECP on Tuesday disqualified Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Zartaj Gul, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week senten­ced over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.
Identical orders issued today by a bench comprising Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed said that Faraz and Ayub were in the process of appealing their convictions in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and had surrendered themselves before the PHC so they could approach the LHC.
The orders said that their convictions were not final and the ECP had not waited for the outcome of their appeals before disqualifying them. They directed notices be issued to the respondents in the matter and meanwhile, “the ECP shall not take any further process” under its notifications to disqualify the PTI leaders.
The orders adjourned both cases to Aug 20. The bench had granted protective bail to the two and Gul earlier today.
Talking to the media, Ayub said the ECP had disqualified him without following due procedure. He thanked the PHC for granting transit bail so he could file his appeal.
A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.

The new measure raises tariffs on some Indian goods to as high as 50pc, among the steepest faced by any US trading partner.
The move is expected to hit key Indian export sectors, including textiles, footwear, and gems and jewellery and marks the most serious downturn in US-India relations since Trump returned to office in January.
In an executive order issued from the White House, Trump said: “I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.
“Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25pc.”
Trump said he determined it “necessary and appropriate” to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India since it was directly or indirectly importing Russian oil.
 






The tariff is set to take effect in three weeks and would be added on top of a separate 25pc tariff entering into force on Thursday. It maintains exemptions for items targeted by separate sector-specific duties, such as steel and aluminium, and categories that could be hit, such as pharmaceuticals.
Trump’s executive order does not mention China, which also buys Russian oil. A White House official had no immediate comment on whether an additional order covering those purchases would be forthcoming.
The development pays off on Trump’s repeated threats to hike the tariff rate on India for its oil purchases from Russia.
India’s foreign ministry said that the decision was “extremely unfortunate” and that New Delhi would take all actions necessary to protect its national interests. “We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” it said.
 






A senior Indian official said New Delhi was blindsided by the sudden imposition of the new levy and the steep rate, as both countries continue to discuss trade issues.
Trump said a day ago he would increase the tariff charged on imports from India from 25pc “very substantially” over the next 24 hours, given India’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
 
 

“India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don’t do business with them. So we settled on 25pc but I think I’m going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they’re buying Russian oil,” he had told CNBC in a televised interview.
“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump had said, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India would keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
Trump had made the same threat about substantially raising tariffs a day ago.
Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.
“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.
“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p><small>2025-08-06 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06185831612de49.png?r=195122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929117/evidence-of-major-money-laundering-racket-found-against-bahria-town-and-malik-riaz-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence of ‘major money laundering racket’ found against Bahria Town and Malik Riaz: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday said that the government had found evidence that real estate tycoon Malik Riaz and Bahria Town had engaged in money laundering on a “grand” scale.
The development adds to the legal woes of the property tycoon and his real estate company, with the former being an absconder in the Al-Qadir Trust case, while the National Accountability Bureau has announced a fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town.
Delivering a televised press statement, Tarar said: “An important development occurred a day ago in the investigation of the Bahria Town corruption case. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) carried out a successful raid in which very important documents have surfaced that are incontrovertible proof of Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s corruption.”
He said the FIA had been conducting an ongoing investigation, with raids being carried out as well. “The documents that have surfaced reveal money laundering and corruption of a great amount by Malik Riaz and Bahria Town with the documents recovered so far showing evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering,” the information minister added.
Tarar said Rawalpindi’s Safari Hospital was being used as a “front office” where cash and records were kept.
“The hospital’s ambulances were being used to transport the money and records,” the minister said. “Not only does this prove illegal transactions and hundi hawala, but the money and documents were kept in the hospital so no suspicion arises.
“When the raid took place yesterday … two people — Imran and Kaiser — who ran the hawala and hundi operations, were linked to the Bahria Town chief financial officer and the evidence has been seized by the FIA,” he added.
Tarar alleged that Bahria Town’s leadership, CFO and finance director were “running a major money laundering racket through which amounts were being sent abroad”.
 


“There will be more amounts besides the Rs1.12bn that will come forth,” he said, adding that the investigation was only beginning.
“The setup in the hospital is clear evidence that billions were being sent out of the country illegally to damage the economy. None of this money was sent abroad through official or banking channels but through illegal means.
“As soon as the FIA carried out the raid, Bahria Town personnel tried to burn some of the records. Some documents were burnt, but we seized the majority of the records … If there was nothing illegal in that hospital, why burn records?” Tarar asked.
The information minister said that the “corruption racket” was being investigated, adding that it involved a lot more people and the FIA had information about the locations of others involved in the scheme.
“I ask these people to turn themselves in,” Tarar said. “Malik Riaz organised all of this and sending money abroad through hundi and hawala is a crime. We will bring more evidence before the public.
“Bahria Town CFO Amir Rasheed and Bahria Town head Shahid Qureshi have been linked to Imran and Kaiser, who were running a racket. Indisputable evidence proves that they were colluding in this mega corruption scandal,” the information minister said.
Tarar maintained that those living in Bahria Town would not be affected by the government’s investigation. “We are only investigating Malik Riaz, his officials and family members involved in this racket,” he clarified.
 






The development comes a day after Riaz called for “dialogue and a dignified solution” amidst Bahria Town’s legal troubles.
“I would like to make a final appeal from the bottom of my heart that we be given a chance to return to serious dialogue, and a dignified solution,” he wrote in a post on X.
“For this purpose, we assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent,” the property tycoon added. “On this occasion, I also assure you that if the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing.”
The property tycoon or Bahria Town have not yet responded to the information minister’s statements.
Bahria Town approaches SC against property auction
Separately, Bahria Town today filed an appeal against the NAB auction of its properties allowed by the Islamabad High Court.
“The impugned order … passed by honourable Islamabad High Court … as well as the order dated [March 19] passed by Accountability Court No.1 are contrary to the express provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, as amended by the Second Amendment Act, 2022, which provides that ‘upon failure of an accused to comply with a plea bargain Agreement, the Agreement becomes inoperative with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties immediately’,” the petition, available with Dawn.com argued.
The petition also argued that NAB “initiated a series of baseless and vexatious legal proceedings with mala fide intent to harass, pressurise and coerce the petitioner”, calling the manner in which NAB acted “discriminatory and prejudicial”.
“The courts … failed to appreciate that [NAB] does not have any authority to auction or sell the properties of the petitioner, in view of Section 33-E (recovery of amount of fines, etc as arrears of land revenue) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and the provisions of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967,” the petition argued.
The petition requested that the Supreme Court grant leave to appeal the IHC’s order.

Modi will go to China for a summit of the multilateral Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that begins on Augst 31, the government source, with direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 

His trip will come at a time when India’s relationship with the US faces its most serious crisis in years after President Donald Trump imposed the highest tariffs among Asian peers on goods imported from India, and has threatened an unspecified further penalty for New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi’s visit to the Chinese city of Tianjin for the summit of the SCO, a Eurasian political and security grouping that includes Russia, will be his first since June 2018. Subsequently, Sino-Indian ties deteriorated sharply after a military clash along their disputed Himalayan border in 2020.
Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Russia in October that led to a thaw. The giant Asian neighbours are now slowly defusing tensions that have hampered business relations and travel between the two countries.
Trump has threatened to charge an additional 10pc tariff on imports from members — which include India — of the BRICS group of major emerging economies for “aligning themselves with anti-American policies”.
Trump said on Wednesday his administration would decide on the penalty for buying Russian oil after the outcome of US efforts to seek a last-minute breakthrough that would bring about a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.
Trump’s top diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Moscow, two days before the expiry of a deadline the president set for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.
Meanwhile, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia on a scheduled visit and is expected to discuss India’s purchases of Russian oil in the wake of Trump’s pressure on India to stop buying Russian crude, according to another government source, who also did not want to be named.
Doval is likely to address India’s defence cooperation with Russia, including obtaining faster access to pending exports to India of Moscow’s S400 air defence system, and a possible visit by President Vladimir Putin to India.
Doval’s trip will be followed by Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in the weeks to come.
Export impact
US and Indian officials told Reuters a mix of political misjudgement, missed signals and bitterness scuttled trade deal negotiations between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose bilateral trade is worth over $190 billion.
India expects Trump’s crackdown could cost it a competitive advantage in about $64bn worth of goods sent to the US that account for 80pc of its total exports, four separate sources told Reuters, citing an internal government assessment.
However, the relatively low share of exports in India’s $4 trillion economy is expected to limit the direct impact on economic growth.
On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India left its GDP growth forecast for the current April-March financial year unchanged at 6.5pc and held rates steady despite the tariff uncertainties.
India’s government assessment report has assumed a 10pc penalty for buying Russian oil, which would take the total US tariff to 35pc, the sources said.
India’s trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The internal assessment report is the government’s initial estimate and will change as the quantum of tariffs imposed by Trump becomes clear, all four sources said.
India exported goods estimated at around $81bn in 2024 to the U.S.
 


The South Asian nation’s goods exports to the US constituted 2pc of GDP in 2024. Its total goods exports globally were at $443bn in 2024.
 


The proposed tariffs on India’s high-value exports face “erosion of price competitiveness encountering intensified rivalry from countries subject to lower duties”, two sources said, citing the internal assessment.</p><small>2025-08-06 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061722051b539e3.jpg?r=172326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929082/psx-soars-past-record-145000-points-on-strong-corporate-results' target='_blank'><strong>PSX soars past record 145,000 points on ‘strong’ corporate results</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday on “strong” corporate results, soaring past 145,000 points.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.
The market reached an intraday high of 145,187.17 points at 3:29pm, before closing at 145,088.49, gaining 2,051.33 points (1.43pc) from yesterday.
Reacting to the development, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that the “boom in business in the stock exchange is a reflection of investors’ confidence in government policies”.
 






The premier said facilitating business and investment in the country was among the government’s top priorities, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
PM Shehbaz said reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue have “improved the tax system and facilitated the business community”. He asserted that the country’s economy was moving on a steady path to progress.
Speaking on today’s PSX gains, Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “The market rallied on strong corporate results, along with hefty payouts in the banking and fertiliser sectors.
“Moreover, expectation of clearance of circular debt during the next week has rejuvenated interest in companies having exposure in coal-based power plants, distribution companies of oil and gas, and upstream exploration and production companies,” he added.
 
 

The interest in the oil and gas sector follows an agreement between Pakistan and the United States that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also said the market was “up as corporate results are expected to be better”.
A key factor behind the market’s upbeat performance was also the release of Pakistan’s fiscal data for FY25. The government reported a nine-year low fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.
This performance surpassed both the government’s and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of a 5.6pc GDP deficit. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.
India’s central bank holds rates amid US tariff battle
Meanwhile, India’s central bank maintained its key interest rate at 5.50pc as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats to raise tariffs on New Delhi because of Russian oil purchases.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept steady the repurchase rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, after a unanimous vote by a six-member panel.
 
 

Bank governor Sanjay Malhotra said global trade challenges remained but that the “Indian economy holds bright prospects in the changing world order”.
“We have taken decisive and forward-looking measures to support growth,” he said in a statement.
The RBI cut rates for the first time in nearly five years in February and followed up with two other reductions in April and June.
Trump’s announcement on Tuesday to “substantially” hike tariffs on Indian imports because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil has added pressure on India.
Before that threat was made, the existing 1pc US tariff on Indian products was already due to rise to 25pc on Thursday. Malhotra acknowledged that “the uncertainties of tariffs are still evolving” even though “growth is robust”.</p><small>2025-08-06 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06154423841896c.jpg?r=154641' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929095/pakistan-starts-deporting-registered-afghan-refugees-unhcr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan starts deporting registered Afghan refugees: UNHCR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has started to deport documented Afghan refugees ahead of its deadline for them to leave, according to the United Nations, in a move that could see more than 1 million Afghans expelled from the country.
The country’s decision follows the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
However, the federal government has informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding PoR cards will begin on September 1.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that it had received reports of arrests and expulsions of legally registered Afghans across the country before Pakistan’s September 1 deadline for them to leave.
The UNHCR said that sending the Afghans back in this way was a breach of Pakistan’s international obligations.
“UNHCR is calling on the government to stop the forcible return and adopt a humane approach to ensure voluntary, gradual, and dignified return of Afghans,” it said in a statement.
 






The voluntary return of the documented refugees shall commence forthwith, said a Pakistan’s interior ministry order seen by Reuters. It said the formal deportation process will start after the deadline.
But Qaisar Khan Afridi, a spokesman for the UNHCR, told Reuters on Wednesday that hundreds of legally registered Afghan refugees had already been detained and deported to Afghanistan from August 1 to August 4.
The interior ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for a comment.
More than 1.3 million Afghans hold documentation known as PoR cards, while 750,000 more have another form of registration known as an Afghan Citizen Card.
Many Afghans have been settled in Pakistan since the 1980s, to escape cycles of war in Afghanistan.
“Such massive and hasty return could jeopardise the lives and freedom of Afghan refugees, while also risking instability not only in Afghanistan but across the region,” UNHCR said.
Pakistani authorities have said that Islamabad wants all Afghan nationals to leave, except for those who have valid visas.
The repatriation drive by Pakistan is part of a campaign called the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, launched in late 2023.
 
 

Pakistan has in the past blamed militant attacks and crimes on Afghan citizens, who form the largest migrant group in the country. Afghanistan has rejected the accusations and has termed the repatriations as forced deportation.
In addition to the repatriation from Pakistan, Afghanistan also faces a fresh wave of mass deportations from Iran.
Aid groups worry that the influx risks further destabilising the country.</p><small>2025-08-06 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617582-three-fc-personnel-martyred-in-attack-on-vehicle-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>Three FC personnel martyred in attack on vehicle in KP's Karak</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
Speaking to the media about the project, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan called it a “game changer for Pakistani trade boost”.
He was quoted as saying, “The Pakistan Mart will facilitate Pakistani traders, enabling them to export their products to regions across the world.”
“The initiative is spearheaded by the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and the DP World company of UAE,” the report added.
Last month, trade with the UAE showed an upward trend. Pakistan’s key export items to the UAE include rice, bovine meat, cotton garments, mangoes, and guavas.
Exports increased 1.87 per cent to $2.121 billion in FY25 from $2.082bn last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE had surged 41.15pc, largely due to increased shipments to Dubai. Imports from the UAE rose 25.75pc to $7.958bn in FY25 from $6.328bn a year ago.
Overall, the country’s trade deficit with the Middle East widened by 7.37pc to $13.974bn in FY25 from $13.014bn a year ago, primarily due to a sharp increase in petroleum imports.</p><small>2025-08-06 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617577-watch-patriotic-song-to-celebrate-independence-day-marka-e-haq-released' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Patriotic song to celebrate Independence Day, Marka-e-Haq released</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Four security personnel, including a driver, were martyred when unknown assailants attacked a Federal Constabulary (FC) vehicle in the Garagri area of Karak, which the chief minister and governor strongly condemned today.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur directed relevant authorities to arrest those involved in the incident as he expressed condolences to the families of those martyred.
“We salute the security personnel and their families who sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” said a statement from the office of KP CM’s press secretary.
 
 

Governor Faisal Kundi also condemned the attack, saying: “The sacrifice of those martyred in the war against terrorism will not go in vain.”
In a separate incident on Tuesday night, three people died in a gun attack on Peshawar’s Warsak Road, including police inspector Ali Hussain.
Peshawar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Masood Ahmed told Dawn.com that Hussain was travelling in a car with two friends last night when four assailants on two motorbikes opened fire on the car, killing all three.
“A pistol and submachine gun (SMG) were used in the attack,” he added.
“We are investigating the incident, and geofencing work is ongoing as well.”
Kundi condemned the “unfortunate and inhumane” incident as he expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Last month, a police official was martyred in Karak while deployed at a police post in the Koh-i-Maidan area, which borders the Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts. He embraced martyrdom while the assailants fled into the mountains.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061415582e7a2f6.jpg?r=141820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929087/71-dead-86-injured-in-kp-rains-flash-floods-since-june-25' target='_blank'><strong>71 dead, 86 injured in KP rains, flash floods since June 25</strong></a><br><p>At least 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across Khyber Paktunkhwa since the start of the monsoon season in late June, according to the latest figures by KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the latest data provided by KP PDMA, the total death toll from rain-related incidents this monsoon season stands at 71, out of which 40 are children, 17 men and 14 women.
Swat district recorded the highest number of lives lost, at 22, during heavy rains. According to PDMA, most of the deaths occurred due to floods, landslides and infrastructure collapse.
On June 27, 17 people, mostly tourists, went missing after unprecedented flash floods struck areas of Swat and Malakand divisions. 12 bodies were recovered, four people were rescued, and the dead body of one person remains missing, according to PDMA. The delay in rescue efforts sparked outrage across the country.
According to the PDMA report, on July 21, a woman died after drowning in a nullah while two children were swept away and reported dead. The same day, three children died after the roof of their house collapsed in the Bahrain tehsil of Swat.
The total death toll, broken down district-wise, currently stands at: Swat (22), Buner (4), Malakand (5), Charsadda (3), Upper Dir (3), Torghar (2), Mansehra (3), Hangu (2), Khyber (3), Abbotabad (5), Shangla (2), Bajaur (3), Lower Kohistan (2), Lakki Marwat (3), Battagram (2).
Karak, Haripur, Upper Kohistan, Nowshera and Kohat recorded one death each.
The report estimated that a total of 86 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, including 38 men, 15 women and 33 children.
Detailing the infrastructure damage, the report recorded the total number of houses damaged at 358, out of which 54 were destroyed completely. The highest number of houses destroyed was in Swat at 63, followed by 38 in Karak and 22 in Buner.
The number of cattle that perished as a result of the rain was 142.
Meanwhile, PDMA has issued a rainfall alert for KP today, forecasting isolated rainfall and thunderstorms over the next 12 -24 hours in parts of the province, including Chitral, Dir, Swat,  Kalam, Mansehra, Battagram, Abbottabad, Haripur, Swabi, Mardan, Noshwera, Peshawar, Charsada, Kohat, Lakki Marwat, Parachinar, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan.
In a statement issued on Sunday,  KP PDMA directed the district administrations and other relevant organisations to remain on high alert as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast more intermittent to heavy rains, wind, and thunderstorms across KP from August 4 to 7.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061253149747894.jpg?r=125728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929075/dg-ispr-rubbishes-rumours-of-army-chief-becoming-president' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR rubbishes rumours of army chief becoming president</strong></a><br><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.
His statement follows a similar rebuttal by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.
Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told The Economist that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.
The Economist noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May conflict with India. It added that the ruling coalition’s recently acquired two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.
 






The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.
He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
 
 

The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p><small>2025-08-06 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06122102aedc7b0.png?r=122140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929071/planning-minister-stresses-pakistans-interest-in-utilising-chinas-tech-progress-for-evs' target='_blank'><strong>Planning minister stresses Pakistan’s interest in utilising China’s tech progress for EVs</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Wednesday.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to Radio Pakistan.
This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.
 
 

Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.
He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.
Last week, Iqbal met with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.
On Sunday, he met with the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.
 
 

Separately, the government yesterday approved a five-year subsidy scheme for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.
The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p><small>2025-08-06 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06110516daf0917.png?r=113513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929066/indian-army-searches-for-scores-missing-after-deadly-himalayan-flood' target='_blank'><strong>Indian army searches for scores missing after deadly Himalayan flood</strong></a><br><p>The Indian army brought in sniffer dogs, drones and heavy earth-moving equipment on Wednesday to search for scores missing a day after a deadly Himalayan flash flood.
At least four people were killed and around 100 are unaccounted for — including 11 soldiers — after a wall of muddy water and debris tore down a narrow mountain valley, smashing into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state.
“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc, have been moved… to hasten the efforts”, the army said today.
Military helicopters were working to bring in “essential supplies, medicines and (for the) evacuation of the marooned”, it added.
Uttarakhand State Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain, and that rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.
Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-storey apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.
 


Several people could be seen running before being engulfed by the dark waves of debris that uprooted entire buildings.
Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency late on Tuesday that he had reports of “four deaths and around 100 people missing”.
‘Extreme event’
Torrential monsoon rains continue to pour down.
“Residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains”, the army added.
Government weather forecasters said on Wednesday that all major rivers in Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark.
Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.
A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with rescue officials estimating it was 15 metres deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.
Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Expert hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimetres of rain within 24 hours reported in the flood zone “counts as an extreme event”.
Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, said such rain in mountains has a “more concentrated” impact than on flatter lowlands.
“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common, and could be linked to climate change”, he said.</p><small>2025-08-06 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06111114d8e8c40.jpg?r=111125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928939/ttp-agrees-not-to-use-civilians-as-human-shield-in-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>TTP agrees not to use civilians as human shield in Tirah</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.
Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a pullout from Tirah to restore peace.
There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.
 
 

“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.

Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit

The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.
It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.
 
 

The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’
It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.
The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.
Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.
Both the incidents sparked widespread protests among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.
The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.
Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.
The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.

According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries “could potentially declare a keep-out zone” on the Moon.
But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon’s surface, with some planning permanent human settlements.
“To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,” US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times.
Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.
The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022, Nasa issued three $5 million contracts to companies to design a reactor.
And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.
Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.
One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging.
“Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,” suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the University of Surrey.
“Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,” he adds.
Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 “given the commitment of enough money”, and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors.
“It’s just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,” he adds, referring to Nasa’s Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon.
