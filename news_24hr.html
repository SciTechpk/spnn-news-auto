A few days later, a furniture brand known for its chairs, Chairman, released a press ad with the caption, “Humari kursi sab se mazboot hai [Our chair is the strongest].”
That one press ad put the brand smack dab in the middle of a political discourse that was raging at the time. Some understood the ad as mocking Bhutto, while others believed it was supporting him. The brand was doing neither. It was simply trying to gain some relevance during a time when a majority of Pakistanis were split into two camps and politics was all they were talking about. Uncannily, Chairman did something that was ahead of its time.
There is now enough evidence that in today’s polarised societies, consumer brands and their advertising agencies are struggling to understand their consumers and to stay relevant.
 
 

Numerous articles and books have appeared trying to figure out the ‘enigma’ that is Generation Z (1997-2012). It is as if the problems brands are facing to stay relevant can be resolved if this generation is ‘correctly’ profiled. But it has been profiled. In fact, unlike past generations, this one has been over-profiled.
Yet, numerous brands are continuing to struggle to get a foothold in the psyche and zeitgeist of the times they are operating in. Nevertheless, consequently, an increasing number of brands are realising that the field of marketing requires some major alterations in a polarised milieu. How can a brand find relevance in fragmented societies split into opposing cultural and political camps?

As societies grow increasingly divided along political and cultural lines, and as consumer identities rapidly change, brands must evolve or risk irrelevance

This is the question brands are asking — even though most have decided to go about their business the way they always have. But this means they are suffering from a ‘cultural lag.’ These brands are not keeping pace with the rapid cultural and political transformations taking place in societies and, consequently, within the markets that these brands operate in.
Consumer brands are not just products or services. They carry an ethos in a bid to strike a much ‘deeper connection’ with consumers. Sneakers are products. Nike, a company that makes this product, is a brand. It posits a belief: “Just Do It.” This is not just a slogan but an ethos: ‘Don’t hold back. Believe in yourself. Take the plunge. This act in itself is a win.’
To survive, brands need to remain relevant. One way of doing this is to jump on a bandwagon of trends driven by a particular generation. But this is not working anymore. For example, in Pakistan, some brands, in a bid, to become relevant for the youth, plug rap/hip-hop music in their communication. On most occasions, the youth finds this to be inauthentic and downright silly.
Disney learned this the hard way when it began to shape characters and plots of their films and TV series according to Gen Z’s ‘woke’ beliefs. But the company suffered one flop after another. It lost a huge amount of money by ‘going woke.’ And the irony is, the ‘woke crowd’ wasn’t interested. In fact, it saw Disney’s ploy as a corporate entity turning a cluster of beliefs into silly caricatures.
 
 

This shows just how tough it has become for brands to stay relevant in this day and age. Those who are playing safe may still be selling their products, but the emotional hold of the brands that make these products is rapidly loosening.
Politics has become a vital part of the transformations taking place in today’s polarised societies. But most brands are petrified to take sides or, for that matter, even to think about politics — even though it is possible that most of their consumers today would want them to. Brand teams and their advertising agencies are not designed to think any deeper than the standard ways they comprehend their consumers. The focus groups and researches that they bank on are engineered to only skim the surface of segments they are targeting.
It’s like those doltish TV shows in which a host asks the most inane questions from guests. One can get to know what a person’s favourite colour, soft-drink or ice cream flavour is, but that’s about it. Most focus groups turn consumers into caricatures.
A 2021 report by the American Marketing Association concluded that, as the political landscape continues to shift and polarise, the influence of politics on consumption behaviours is poised to grow. The report suggested that “analysing and utilising consumers’ political ideologies may prove not only useful to brands, but also necessary…”
 


Indeed, but such suggestions horrify most brands. Those who handle them are not designed to think about marketing in this manner. Secondly, most of them have only a superficial understanding of politics. So, even if they do venture out to determine the politics of their consumers, what will they ask? Some brands have started to hire help in this regard by asking sociologists and political scientists to design questioners.
After doing this, they have plunged in to pick a side. The American ice cream brand Ben&Jerry’s openly advocates progressive/liberal causes, whereas Black Rifle Coffee quietly supports conservative causes.
 
 

In fact, in the US, there are now numerous ‘Red Brands’ and ‘Blue Brands.’ Red ones identify with conservative views, and the blue ones uphold ‘liberal’ ideals. This is how these brands are finding relevance in a polarised society and, thus, market.
However, not all brands want to go this far — especially in Pakistan. But they are likely to continue losing relevance if they fail to understand the politics of their consumers. They don’t really have to pick a side. They only have to reshape the way they understand today’s consumers. This can provide them a deeper understanding of their consumers and more relevant communication can be the outcome, without even mentioning any politics.
I once worked with a Thai sociologist who was associated with a major advertising agency. This was during a research stint I was a part of in Washington DC, in 2018.
He demonstrated that even when a person enters a store just to buy a soft-drink can, on the surface, his choice in this regard is being influenced by taste and aesthetics. But, more importantly, what’s on the surface is being unconsciously influenced by his political and social views. In politically charged times, a brand needs to dig and mine these.

Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

What we know so far:

Production suspended after Israel hits Iran’s South Pars gas field
7 more killed, over 100 injured in Israel as Tehran responds with another missile barrage
Germany, France, UK offer talks over nuclear programme
3 drones reportedly aimed at US base in Iraq shot down as Trump warns against attacks on US


A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.
The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.
Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.
 






Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.
The ambulance service said at least seven people were killed overnight, including a 10-year-old boy and a woman in her 20s, and more than 140 were injured in multiple attacks.
Search and rescue workers combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in multiple strikes, using flashlights and dogs to look for survivors.
Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.
It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.
So far, at least nine people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.
 






Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, Press TV reported.
The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.
The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.
Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.
The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea said in a televised address.
“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples […] This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.
In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.
The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control.
A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said.
Trump distances US from strikes on Iran, warns against attacks on it in ‘any way’
US President Donald Trump said earlier today that if Iran attacks the United States in “any way, shape or form”, it would face the might of the US military “at levels never seen before”.
Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the US had nothing to do with an attack on Iran overnight and that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”
 


Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel’s strikes on Iran, the Associated Press reported, citing a US military official and a second US official.
The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.
AP further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel’s bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.
Germany, France, UK offer Iran talks over nuclear programme
Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.

“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster ARD late on Saturday.
“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”
“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”
Tehran called off nuclear talks that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s bombing, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.
Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.
US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have “repeatedly said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon before Israel” launched its attacks on the Islamic Republic this week, AP noted.
 
 

Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.
A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be held in Oman on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.
Gas field attack
In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.
The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.
The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, Tasnim said.
Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.
Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.
Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.
An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.
 
 

With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.
B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.
Tehran has warned Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.
Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.
Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA reported it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p><small>2025-06-15 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609269-18-pakistani-pilgrims-died-during-hajj-2025' target='_blank'><strong>'18 Pakistani pilgrims died during Hajj 2025'</strong></a><br><p>

Trump hailed the United States as the “hottest country in the world” after watching tanks, aircraft, and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.
But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse protesters in Los Angeles and US ally Israel traded missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Trump’s parade on an overcast night in Washington came after tens of thousands of “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.
Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they “fight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win”.

The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.
In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington’s adversaries of “total and complete” defeat, with the United States increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
“Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,” Trump said.
‘Happy Birthday’
Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.
The last such parade in the United States was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead, and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.
Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
The army said it cost up to $45 million.
But while the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” and there were occasional chants of “USA! USA!”, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.
The White House said that “over 250,000 patriots showed up” for the event, without providing evidence. Communications Director Steven Cheung described the “No Kings” protests as a “complete and utter failure”.
“No Kings” organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with AFP journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.
Organisers said they were protesting against Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.
‘Display of authoritarianism’
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
Police in Los Angeles used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters who had gathered in front of the federal building in downtown, the focus of demonstrations for the last week.
AFP reporters at the scene said there was no disorder, but it appeared local officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines are stationed.
Some protesters targeted Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida — while a small group even gathered in Paris.
“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism”.
The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband Saturday in the northern state of Minnesota — in what the governor called a targeted attack — also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.</p><small>2025-06-15 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1511425723d9c26.jpg?r=115026' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917296/toddler-among-7-killed-as-helicopter-crashes-in-indian-himalayas' target='_blank'><strong>Toddler among 7 killed as helicopter crashes in Indian Himalayas</strong></a><br><p>Seven people, including a toddler, were killed on Sunday in India when a helicopter ferrying Hindu pilgrims from a shrine crashed in the Himalayas, officials said.
The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people killed when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.
The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told AFP.
The state’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said rescue teams had been dispatched to the scene after the “very sad news”.
The crash was likely caused by bad weather, according to district tourism official Rahul Chaubey.
Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath temple during the summer when it is possible to access the site, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres.
A cottage industry of helicopter charter firms has developed to serve wealthy pilgrims who want to visit shrines in the Indian Himalayas, but who prefer to avoid arduous trekking.
Six people were killed last month in another helicopter crash en route to the shrine.</p><small>2025-06-15 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609257-will-respond-with-bullets-if-fired-upon-gandapur-warns-of-armed-march-on-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>'Will respond with bullets if fired upon',  Gandapur warns of armed march on Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>

It may not have been so openly stated, but one important objective is regime change in Iran in order to try and usher in a regime more like Israel’s other Middle Eastern/ regional neighbours, who are happy to be friends with Tel Aviv. That is why they offer only perfunctory condemnation of Israel’s ethnic-cleansing of Palestinians not just in Gaza, but also the West Bank.
A wider war also helps shift the focus from the worst ethnic cleansing of this century in Gaza by relentless bombing, other military means, and mass starvation. It is the food blockade which was beginning to create a little unease among at least Israel’s European allies, who have so far offered unconditional material and diplomatic support to it on Gaza.
 
 

At least the European allies, I say, because the US administration solidly supports the apartheid state, which is executing the American president’s Gaza Riviera Plan. It visualises beachside resorts after the forceful displacement of two million Palestinians to unspecified countries, presumably Muslim.
The Gaza genocide has really not been about Israeli hostages taken during the October 2023 atrocity. Ample evidence of this can be found in the conduct of presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, whose family members are crypto business partners with the Trump family. He has walked away twice, if not more times, from deals that could have secured the release or exchange of the remaining hostages in Hamas captivity. Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians remain in Israeli captivity who are no more than hostages.

How long can Iran’s arsenal of reportedly 2,000 ballistic missiles last?

Despite this unconditional support to Israel, President Donald Trump so far seems unprepared to commit US forces in any open confrontation. Over the coming days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts will be directed towards somehow sucking in the US to commit forces into the war with Iran.
After the Iranian missile retaliation against the Israeli air campaign, which killed several senior Iranian military commanders, leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and targeted nuclear sites, former Israeli prime minister and military chief Ehud Barak picked off some of these objectives one by one in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
Ehud Barak was categorical in saying that Israel’s air campaign may have ‘delayed’ by a few weeks Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon but, he said, even if the US joined the air campaign, it would delay it by no more than a few months at best. “They have 400 kilograms of 60 per cent enriched uranium and it can be enriched to 90pc in a garage with the right equipment and they will have a crude bomb,” he said.
Quoting the chief of the IAEA (the internati­o­nal nuclear watchdog), who said that many of Iran’s key facilities are “hundreds of yards” und­erground in old mines, etc, Mr Barak maintained these were “out of our reach”. “I have no illusions we’ll do anything more than damage or hurt them.”
The former IDF chief said the initial successes of the air campaign, which exceeded expectations, should be used to push through a nuclear deal with Iran, stop the war in Gaza, and go for peace in the wider region, including Saudi Arabia, which would take time and won’t be easy but still needs to be done.
He said going further for Israel without US logistics support will be difficult, so it should say ‘we have done all we could do, now it is up to you’. At a time when Israeli intelligence’s targeting of the Iranian military’s key leaders is being seen as a manifestation of internal divisions, Ehud Barak also addressed the issue of regime change.
Saying it did not appear possible without US ground troops on Iranian soil, he listed wars from Korea to Vietnam to Afghanistan that the US entered but was unable to win: “How did those wars go?” he asked, while doubting that President Trump, or any other US leader or the American public for that matter, would have the appetite to commit US boots to the ground.
It is true that in 2018, Trump unilaterally scuppered an Obama-led deal that stopped Iran’s nuclear weapons march in exchange for sanctions relief. But the scrapping pushed Tehran back to restarting its enrichment levels closer to weapons grade. So, in a sense, this war hasn’t been about Iran’s nuclear arms quest but more about getting it to bow to Israeli-US will.
Therefore, it is important to see who is eventually likely to get the upper hand in this conflict. With the US and entire Western production, stores and supplies of modern weaponry at its disposal, it would be safe to assume Israel can outlast Iran in a war of attrition. For all practical purposes, Iran has no air force, and its air defence system appears inadequate.
How long can its arsenal of reportedly 2,000 ballistic missiles last? What happens beyond that? These are some of the questions that need to be answered. So far, Iran has taken massive hits and yet has been able to remain defiant and retaliate. Can it sustain this in the medium to long term, and will there be any third-party mediation to stop the war?
Or, if cornered further, will Iran lash out dire­c­tly at US bases and assets in the region and even nations hosting them in order to expand the conflict as a means of stopping it? The impact of any such eventuality will not only be on millions of lives in the region but also on the global economy.

PBC Chief Executive Officer Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers do not differentiate between major taxpayers and the informal sector.
“We are alarmed at the draconian powers proposed to be granted to the FBR. If past practice is anything to go by, these will most likely be misused to harass the formal taxpaying sector,” he feared.
“We are disappointed that the powers proposed for the FBR will do the exact opposite of encouraging investment,” Ehsan informed the finance minister.
Pointing out excessive powers to FBR, he said Section 11E enables tax assessment and recovery based on suspicion without proper investigation, while Section 14AE allows arbitrary seizure of business premises and property without adequate safeguards.
Section 32B empowers private auditors with quasi-legal authority over businesses, while Section 33 introduces 10-year prison terms and Rs10 million fines for broadly defined “tax fraud,” which is likely to encompass business errors.
Section 37AA authorises arrest without a warrant based on mere suspicion of tax fraud—a power that invites abuse and harassment, followed by Section 37B, which permits a 14-day detention of businesspersons, extendable through magistrates. Overriding the principle of client/advisor relationship, Section 58C will grant the FBR access to the offices of tax advisers and firms where discrepancies in returns are suspected.
He informed the finance minister that from a country on the brink of default less than three years ago, the current economic stability owes much to your determined leadership. The raging fire of inflation has been doused, borrowing costs have declined sharply, the fiscal deficit is in control, the current ac­­c­ount is in surplus, two IMF tranches have been appr­o­ved, and the rupee is stable.
A substantial contribution to securing the IMF programme, and the resultant solvency, is the formal sector’s disproportionate contribution to taxes in the FY25 budget.
The council, for FY26, sought and has so far been denied a roadmap of gradual reduction in taxes. The critical need to support exports amid significant uncertainty from US tariffs has not been addressed.

• Asad Qaiser says it is Pakistan’s moral duty to support Iran
ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Kha­waja Asif on Saturday cal­le­­d on the Organisation of Islamic Coope­ra­tion (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to map out a joint strategy in the wake of Israel’s ongoing aggression, warning that if the Muslim Ummah does not unite, every Muslim country’s turn will come.
“The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger game plan,” he said while speaking in the National Assembly.
The remarks came as another war in Middle East has sparked a global turmoil. The defence minister pointed out that most of the Muslim nations were already facing security risks.
“Strong leadership is needed now,” he remarked and described Israel’s brutal actions, particularly its military aggression against Iran as a serious threat to regional and global peace.
Regretting the apathy of the Muslim world over the aggression in Palestine where even children were being brutally killed, he said there were more protests in non-Muslim countries than in Muslim nations. He assured that Pakistan stands firmly with Iran and will continue to support it on all international fora.
The defence minister said that while Pakistan’s military strength was commendable, the economy must also be strong.
 






Tax evasion
Mr Asif said that the country suffers huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in sectors like tobacco, real estate, steel, and tyres. “We lose around Rs300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone,” he said, acknowledging that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made some improvements, but much more needs to be done.
“If we can just improve our tax collection by 50 per cent, we wouldn’t need foreign loans,” he noted.
He demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and FBR to brief the parliament on the people behind large-scale tax evasion. “We need honesty in governance. Only then we can provide real relief to the people,” he said.
Jibe at PTI
The minister criticised those who now attack the government’s economic policy had once urged the IMF not to support Pakistan.
“These people tried to sabotage our economy,” he said. “Pakistan is not about any one person. It is a mission, a belief, and a shared history.”
He urged political leaders to rise above personal ambitions and serve the nation with sincerity.
‘Stand by Iran’
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser in his speech while referring to Israeli attack on Iran said, “It is our moral obligation to stand by Iran at this critical time.”
He also said that Israel has committed the worst atrocities against Palestinians, sparing neither children, women, the elderly, nor hospitals and schools. He regretted the criminal silence of international community, particularly from human rights organisations and so-called democratic states.
“Most disappointing, however, is the deafening silence of the Muslim Ummah,” he said and demanded that the government immediately launch diplomatic efforts to convene an emergency session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Discussing financial ‘injustices’ with Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, he said, “After the Fata merger, the province’s NFC award share should have been increased from 14 per cent to 19pc, but there has been no substantial progress.
During his visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had claimed that an additional 1pc allocation was allocated for terrorism-affected areas.
 
 

However, the province’s agreed annual share of 4.84pc, amounting to Rs381bn, has yet to be released, Mr Qaider recalled.
Furthermore, the hydel profit amount due to the province has also been withheld.
“Is this all just because the people of KP voted for PTI,” he asked.
He said the current government has earmarked only Rs550m for the entire province’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (PSDP).
“We are demanding our constitutional rights, and if the situation remains unchanged, we will stage a sit-in on the motorway with our people.” he warned.
 






‘Discrepancy’
Expressing his views, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar stated that there is a clear contradiction between the public statements made by the prime minister and cabinet members and the figures presented in the budget documents.
He said that while government officials insist that agriculture is the backbone of country’s economy, there is nothing for this vital sector, which ensures food security.
“Do you want to depend on imports to meet country’s food needs?” he questioned.
 






In her remarks, PPP leader Sharmila Farooqui questioned the powers being given to the FBR to arrest people without any notice.
She pointed out that external debts continue to pile up but over 100 entities had been given relief in taxes.

Additionally, some existing taxes have been eliminated or reduced, with export processing zones and special economic zones exempted from the services tax.
Addressing a post-budget press conference at the CM House, he announced the abolition of the entertainment tax and reductions in restaurant taxes.
He said that as per the Sindh Finance Bill 2025-26, the stamp duty on third-party vehicle insurance had also been reduced to Rs50 with a drop in the insurance tax from 15 to 5pc, adding that a list of tax-exempted items would be published as per the IMF requirement.
As per the finance bill, services of parliament and assembly members, local government representatives, judges, and tribunal members were exempted from sales tax.

Chief minister opposes Centre’s 18pc general sales tax on solar panels

Tax exemption on construction of 10,000 sq. feet of houses in private residential schemes and there would be no tax on health and life insurance worth Rs500,000.
The government-approved universities and colleges will also not have to pay tax on educational research, while Haj and Umrah travel operators will be exempt from tax.
According to the bill, a 19.5pc tax would be applied to vehicle trackers, security cameras, and alarm systems in security services.
The internet, telephone services, Wi-Fi and broadband connections service will have to pay 19.5pc tax, and there will be a three per cent tax on those who transact vehicles.
There will be 8pc tax on online payments of restaurants, hotels, farmhouses and beverages. Cab services will have to pay 5pc, rental car services and freight vehicles will have to pay 8pc tax.
As per the bill, 8pc tax will have to be paid on hiring armed guards and security guards.
There will be 8pc tax on real estate services and 3pc on foreign exchange services.
Coaching and training centres will also have to pay 3pc tax. Schools and colleges that receive an annual fee of Rs500,000 will also pay 3pc tax.
The chief minister in a wide-ranging post-budget press conference outlined an ambitious fiscal and development agenda for the province while addressing serious financial challenges and federal shortfalls.
Flays Centre for withholding funds
He criticised the federal government for failing to meet its financial commitments, revealing that Sindh was informed just one day before the budget presentation that Rs105bn in expected funds would be withheld. “Sindh has received Rs1,478.5bn from the divisible pool since last year, but Rs422.3bn remains outstanding,” he lamented.
Mr Shah expressed hope that the withheld amount would be disbursed by the end of June.
He said that the Sindh government would allocate Rs590bn for development projects this year, with a total budget of Rs3.45tr — Rs1tr for development and Rs2.15tr for current expenditures.
“Notably, Rs1.1tr is earmarked for salaries and pensions, leading to salary increases of 12pc for lower-grade employees and 10pc for higher grades.
He said that sectoral budget increases included an 18pc rise in education funding and an 11pc increase in health. Funding for agriculture, irrigation, and local government projects has also seen significant boosts.
Job vacancies
He also noted 20,000 to 25,000 job vacancies in Grades 1 to 4, with plans for recruitment via IBA-administered tests for Grades BPS-5 to 7 and filling higher Grade 16 positions.
On the critical Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, the chief minister expressed concern over the halving of federal funding from Rs30bn to Rs15bn.
Opposes tax on solar panels
Mr Shah emphasised that major projects are not included in the Federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and criticised the 18pc tax on solar panels as unjust, warning that the Pakistan Peoples Party would not support the federal budget if concerns raise are not resolved.
Addressing various challenges, he acknowledged delays in operating 150 buses in Karachi due to resource constraints but highlighted ongoing infrastructure and sanitation projects.
On digitisation, Mr Shah admitted the Sindh government had not fully digitised land records yet, but was piloting a project in Matli and Sukkur.
Mr Shah revealed Rs25bn allocated for solar projects and the launch of afforestation programmes to combat climate change, admitting more needs to be done.

• Meagre allocations for Sukkur motorway and K-IV projects deplored
KARACHI: Trade and industry leaders on Saturday strongly criticised the federal and Sindh budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, calling them deeply disappointing and discriminatory towards Karachi, the country’s economic nerve centre.
Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala and Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani expressed serious concerns over the sheer neglect and denial of essential development funds to Karachi and the province of Sindh as a whole.
In a joint statement, they also demanded that before the approval of budgets, necessary amendments be made by significantly enhancing allocations for Karachi-centric development projects.
Highlighting the gross underfunding of the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, a strategic infrastructure project vital for the economic connectivity of Sindh and Karachi, they said despite the project’s total cost exceeding Rs400 billion, the federal government allocates a meagre Rs15bn for 2025-26, reflecting a blatant disregard for Sindh’s development priorities, especially considering that Karachi would directly benefit from the completion of this motorway.
The K-IV Water Supply Project has been in limbo for years despite being a critical lifeline for the water-scarce city of Karachi. Despite multiple promises made at the highest level, including by prime minister himself, the federal government has once again failed to demonstrate a commitment to the project, allocating only Rs3.2bn out of the total required Rs150bn, thus raising doubts about the government’s sincerity in addressing Karachi’s water crisis.
They stated that the Sindh government has failed to address Karachi’s needs adequately. In the provincial development outlay, the Sindh government has allocated a meagre Rs100 million for the K-IV project and a symbolic Rs15bn for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, amounts that are practically meaningless in terms of project execution.
Alarmingly, this marks the third consecutive year in which not a single new mega development project has been announced for Karachi, they said, adding that the only gesture made was the allocation of Rs eight billion for the continuation of previously announced mega projects, most of which have been progressing at a snail’s pace.
Despite being a vital lifeline for Karachi, the K-IV project continues to face inexcusable delays, even as the city’s demand for water grows exponentially with each passing day.
Shockingly, millions of gallons of water are being wasted and discharged into the sea, while the people of Karachi and its industrial zones remain parched and desperate for a sustainable water supply, they deplored.
Appreciating the ongoing development of the new canal from Hub Dam, they noted that the project was initially scheduled for completion by August. With barely two months remaining, the government must accelerate work on a war footing to ensure its timely execution.
They further recalled that an additional supply of 10 MGD (million gallons per day) was promised for the SITE Industrial Area, and the relevant PC-I had already been approved — a move widely welcomed by the business community. However, the promised supply remains unfulfilled, leaving industries in a continued state of uncertainty.
They stressed that the continuous denial of fair development funding for Karachi is not just a regional injustice but a national threat, as Karachi contributes the largest share of 67pc revenue to the national exchequer, 90pc to the provincial kitty and 54pc in terms of exports.
They called on both the federal and provincial governments to urgently revise their priorities and ensure that Karachi receives its fair share of development funding. The time for symbolic allocations and broken promises has long passed. Concrete action, substantial funding, and political will are now required to address the growing frustration of the citizens and business community of Karachi.

According to the just released Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, whatever spin you may want to give it, the economy is in a deep downturn given the collapse of the crop sector and the drastic decline in incomes in rural areas, where almost 60 per cent of the population lives and where extreme poverty is concentrated.
Severe decline in rural incomes and little success in increasing exports have led to poor growth in manufacturing. A combination of the two has slowed down the services sector, which now makes up nearly 60pc of our GDP.
 
 

The resulting overall economic growth is dismal at around 2.5pc, while we need a minimum growth of at least 6.5pc to absorb the increase in the labour force and reduce the prevalent high levels of poverty, which, according to a recent World Bank report, has risen dramatically, post-Covid, to near 50pc.
At the same time, there is no denying the fact that the economy has stabilised. There is no threat of default given our current reserves, a stable exchange rate (though it has come under pressure), a current account surplus (thanks to a surge in remittances), and inflation at an all-time low (it is expected hover around 5-6pc). For this, the government can take full credit — a fact recognised by the IMF and rating agencies.

Relief was hardly given to those who deserve it most.

So, is the price that we have had to pay for macroeconomic stability a drastic contraction of the real economy? While the stabilisation measures have indeed helped, I would strongly argue that the poor sequencing of these measures and economic reforms by our policymakers are chiefly to blame.
A prime example is the agricultural sector. The cold-blooded way in which the government removed the wheat support price shows the anti-rural, pro-urban bias of the current regime. Without first ensuring the development of an alternative market, it left the farmers — both small and large — to suffer huge losses at the hands of the middlemen.
Now let’s turn to what the future holds for the economy under IMF tutelage.
 
 

In his budget speech, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb emphatically stated that we have launched on a mission ‘to change the DNA of the economy from its currents inefficient uncompetitive path to one of high productivity and sustained economic growth’ — or words to that effect.
To put it more simply, he promised to implement economic reforms that will root out the current incentive structure, which breeds inefficiencies and inequalities and results in recurring stop-go cycles. We waited with bated breath to hear of the far-reaching reforms that are intended to usher in this process of creative destruction and the birth of a new economic order, but have been extremely disappointed.
Yes, some worn-out, positive steps were announced, which have been repeatedly tried before, with little success. This includes a tariff reform package — in the works since 1988 — with a maximum upper limit on import duties of 15pc in five years and four slabs. Significantly, there was no mention of a reduction in import duties on products of our most inefficient industries (for example, autos) to improve their competitiveness. This demonstrates a lack of reluctance to take on entrenched business interests.
The privatisation of the same old state-owned enterprises, such as PIA, the power distribution companies, etc, was promised. Hopefully, this time, the process will be successfully completed. A lot of faith was placed in the digital economy and increasing its export earnings (with ambitious targets), though concrete measures in this direction were difficult to discern.
 
 

Relief was given under strong pressure to the real estate sector and traders, despite high hopes to the contrary, and hardly any to those who deserve it most — the working poor. And technology and data were waved around to bring more tax evaders into the tax net as if these have never been available before. Agriculture income tax was left to the provinces.
Key issues related to investment in people (health, education, social protection) were rattled off, highlighting initiatives and projects by the prime minister, but the fact that we are cutting down on their already meagre share in the federal development programme, which itself has fallen to its lowest level in living memory to around 1pc of GDP, was not mentioned. Ultimately, this left us with roads and highways and infrastructure which would transform the economy.
And we had envisaged this budget in the shape of a reform package to change our DNA!

• FBR chief says tampered vehicles to be seized and destroyed
• IMF to review tax authority’s performance every week
• Average annual income of top 1pc households is Rs10m
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Saturday pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the Finance Bill 2025 granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandvi­walla, convened for a second consecutive day to examine the Finance Bill 2025. Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.
Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns. “Such notices should require the express permission of the FBR chairman and the finance minister,” he said.
Senator Shibli Faraz also stressed that this extension of power to tax commissioners is turning Pakistan into a police state. “Even taxpayers will flee,” he warned.
Senator Farooq H. Naek underscored the imp­act of business bec­ause of the same, stating that money laundering notices are not trivial. “They can cripple a businessman’s ability to import or export,” Mr Naek warned the FBR.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the apprehensions of senators, stating that money laundering notices are indeed a very serious matter and should be reviewed carefully under this provision.
The Pakistan Business Council has also raised alarm, formally writing to the prime minister to urge the government to reconsider the plan to empower FBR officials with arrest and notice authority.
Meanwhile, FBR Cha­ir­man Rashid Mahmood Langrial defended the move, stressing that tax officials already possess the authority to arrest businesspersons, but the procedure has been further refined in the latest bill.
However, Senator Shibli Faraz strongly opposed the proposal to grant arrest powers to income tax commissioners, arguing that such mea­sures are turning the country into a police state.
Amendments to the Customs Act
The committee also examined proposed ame­­ndments to the Customs Act, 1969, including the rollout of a digital Cargo Tracking System (CTS) to monitor the movement of imports, exports, transhipments and transit cargo. The CTS aims to curb smuggling and ensure duty compliance while easing legitimate trade.
 
 

Another amendment would exempt postal or courier imports valued below Rs5,000 from duties and taxes. However, the de minimis limit for courier parcels is set to drop from Rs15,000 to Rs500 to prevent misuse by individuals.
The committee also approved strict measures against tampered vehicles. Under the proposed law, any vehicle found with a tampered chassis number, cut-and-weld modifications or re-stamped identification will be presumed smuggled, regardless of registration status.
The FBR chairman clarified that such vehicles will be confiscated and destroyed. “Such vehicles will not be auctioned again. In principle, these vehicles should be scrapped to prevent the resale of parts,” he said.
The committee recommended that the confiscation and destruction of such vehicles must occur within 30 days of seizure.
The Pakistan Poultry Association requested that customs duty on grandparent chicks be reduced to zero, while the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture sought a cut in duty on imported and reconditioned tractors from 15 to 5 per cent.
FBR chief briefing
Briefing the committee, Mr Langrial highlighted Pakistan’s stark wealth inequality, stating that just 5pc of the population controls most of the country’s wealth.
“Ninety-five per cent cannot afford to pay taxes,” he added, revealing that the top one per cent earn an average of Rs10 million per year.
The focus must shift from expanding the tax net to taxing the rich effectively, he emphasised. He added that only 6m people are registered tax filers, while 132m are under 18 or senior citizens — outside the labour force. At the same time, 67m are unemployed, including a large segment of educated women.
Mr Langrial confirmed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to introduce new tax measures worth Rs701 billion for FY26. The FBR aims to generate Rs500bn through enforcement measures, although the Fund has adjusted this target to Rs389bn.
He said that tax collection from the sugar, cotton, and other sectors is being underreported. In the tobacco sector, strict monitoring will start from July 1 to track green tobacco leaf production, he said, adding, “We will fix cameras at identified places.”
The IMF will also conduct weekly reviews of the FBR’s performance. Mr Langrial claimed that improved enforcement had already led to significant tax collection gains.

Mr Dar was scheduled to travel to New York next week to attend a United Nations conference on Palestinian statehood. But on Friday, France and Saudi Arabia — co-sponsors of the event — requested the UN to postpone the gathering.
The request followed Israeli air strikes on Iran. Speaking in Paris, French President Emmanuel Mac­ron said the conference, which aimed to advance a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, had been delayed but would still take place.
“While we have to postpone this conference for logistical and security reasons, it will take place as soon as possible,” Presi­dent Macron said.
The changing situation in the Middle East has also delayed another planned visit — that of a trade delegation from Islamabad, which was to hold talks in Washington on tariffs.
 
 

At a news briefing last week, US President Donald Trump had anno­unced that the delegation would arrive “next week” for trade talks. Those plans are now on hold.
“But it will happen soon. We are working on the schedule,” a source told Dawn.

• Egypt blocks activists’ bid to march to Gaza border
CAIRO: Israeli firing and air strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, many of them near an aid distribution site operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Saturday, local health authorities said.
Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.
The Israeli army said in a statement that an aircraft had opened fire on a person “to neutralise the threat” after he advanced towards troops and ignored warning shots fired near a group.
Last week, the army warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to sites of the GHF between 6pm and 6am local time, describing these roads as closed military zones. The GHF said none of its distribution centres was opened on Saturday.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.
The United Nations rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous, and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.
“None of our distribution sites were open today, and there were no incidents at our sites because they were closed,” the GHF said in a written response to Reuters about Saturday’s incident.
The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.
Hamas, which denies Israeli charges that it steals aid, accused Israel of “employing hunger as a weapon of war and turning aid distribution sites into traps of mass deaths of innocent civilians.”
Health officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza said Israeli fire killed at least 12 Palestinians, who gathered to wait for aid trucks along the coastal road north of the strip.
The Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards a so-called humanitarian zone, saying it would forcefully work against “terror organisations” in the area.
March to Gaza border
Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have blocked activists’ efforts to hold a march to the Gaza border to draw attention to Israel’s blockade of the war-torn Palestinian territory, organisers said Saturday.
Several dozen activists hoping to join the planned Global March to Gaza were stopped on the edge of Cairo as they attempted to reach the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya, the organisers said.
From there they had hoped to travel on by road to the North Sinai city of El-Arish, the starting point for their planned march to the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on the Gaza border.
Most of the activists were ordered onto buses back to the capital after several hours of questioning, but some remained in custody on Saturday, the organisers said.
“We were blocked for six to seven hours before security forces violently dispersed our group,” one organiser said.
At least one activist was expelled from Egypt, several sources said, adding to dozens more denied entry or expelled in the run-up.
Egyptian authorities have not commented on the reported expulsions.
The foreign ministry had warned that while Egypt backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel” to lift its Gaza blockade, any foreign delegations intending to visit the border area must obtain prior permission.

THE ‘ancient’ sculpture.—Dawn

 
MITHI: An apparently centuries-old wooden sculpture of a robed, bearded man has been discovered in the hilly region of Karoonjhar, Nagarp­arkar, intriguing historians and archaeologists about its cultural origins.
Sources privy to the discovery said the artefact was recovered near a seasonal riverbed in the Karoonjhar hills by area residents and social activists. 
The intricately carved wooden statue depicts a robed man with traditional features, and is believed to be of considerable antiquity. Preliminary observations suggest it may be linked to ancient eastern cultures, though its exact provenance remains unclear.
Researcher and writer Khalid Kumhar, who had extensively documented the historical geography of Tharparkar, remarked that the design and posture of the statue appeared to reflect influences of East Asian or Chinese culture. 
“The statue does not match known relics of Buddhist or Jain iconography common to this region,” he noted.
The discovery drew the attention of the Sindh Department of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities and provincial minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah stated that measures would be taken to preserve the object. 
“A team of heritage experts will conduct thorough research on the sculpture, and their findings will be shared with the public in due course,” said the minister.
The wooden statue has been temporarily secured by locals until it is formally examined by experts from the culture department.

The vessel, MV ASL ROSE arrived from Australia carrying 20,000 tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser destined for Afghanistan.
Previously, the first ship under the Afghan Transit Trade, MV Beyond 2, berthed at Gwadar Port on Feb 4.
The current consignment was imported by Agven Private Limited, further highlighting Gwadar Port’s growing role as an emerging transit hub for Afghanistan.
This progress in Afghan transit trade became possible after the Economic Coordination Committee of Pakistan abolished the requirement for bank guarantees on Afghan trade — a policy aimed at facilitating smoother trade and strengthening economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Gwadar Port Chairman Shah Irfan Ahmed remarked that the successful berthing and swift unloading of MV ASL ROSE demonstrate that Gwadar Port is now fully equipped for modern and efficient commercial operations.
He emphasised that Gwadar’s expanding role in Afghan Transit Trade not only showcases the port’s capacity but also opens new avenues of economic opportunities for the entire region.
“We aim to establish Gwadar Port as a reliable trade corridor not just for Afghanistan but for Central Asia as well,” Mr Ahmed added.

The development comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.
Israel’s military announced earlier it was launching attacks on several sites across Iran as it kept up its campaign targeting Tehran’s military and nuclear sites, following earlier threats that the Iranian capital “will burn” amid the latter’s retaliatory strikes targeting Israel.

Radiation ‘unchanged’ in Iran’s Natanz area; ‘limited damage’ to Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites


Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that the talks were cancelled on X on Saturday. Oman has been mediating the talks.
“Diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace,” he added.
Albusaidi’s statement came a day after Israel launched a sweeping air offensive against Iran, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop it from building an atomic weapon.
 






Earlier today, Iran said that the dialogue with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme is “unjustifiable” after Israel’s biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, abandoning planned talks on Sunday.
“Continuing Iran-US nuclear talks is unjustifiable while barbarous Israeli attacks persist on the country, Iranian state media quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying on Saturday.
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Israel’s attack on Iran made the talks “meaningless”, though adding that it was uncertain Iran would attend Sunday’s round of talks in Oman.
“The other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran’s territory,” state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.
“It is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,” Baghaei was quoted as saying.
He said Israel “succeeded in influencing” the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington’s permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed in a video message to intensify his country’s offensive, warning that the attacks over the past 48 hours are “nothing compared” to what will happen in the coming days.
He added that Israeli strikes on Iran have set Tehran’s nuclear programme back, possibly by years, adding that heavier blows were yet to come.
“We will hit every site and every target of the Ayatollahs’ regime and what they have felt so far is nothing compared with what they will be handed in the coming days,” Netanyahu said in a video message.
He added that the military was now destroying Iran’s ability to manufacture ballistic missiles.
 






The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday that Iran’s nuclear regulatory authority had informed it there was no change in off-site radiation levels in Isfahan, site of one of the nuclear targets struck by Israeli forces.
Earlier, the IAEA said four critical buildings at the Isfahan nuclear site had been damaged, including a uranium conversion facility and a fuel plate fabrication plant.
“As in Natanz, no increase in off-site radiation expected,” the agency said in a post on X.
 






Iranian state TV reported that around 60 people, including 20 children, had been killed in an attack on a housing complex, with more strikes reported across the country. Israel said it had attacked more than 150 targets.
In Israel, air raid sirens sent residents into shelters as waves of missiles streaked across the sky and interceptors rose to meet them. At least three people were killed overnight. An Israeli official said Iran had fired around 200 ballistic missiles in four waves.
“We are currently launching attacks on several sites in Iran,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said in a televised press conference following an overnight barrage of missiles and drones launched by Iran.
Defrin later said that Israel’s ongoing air campaign had created “aerial freedom of action” from western Iran to Tehran.
“We have created aerial freedom of action from west Iran all the way to Tehran… Tehran is no longer immune,” he told journalists, adding that the air force “launched a massive strike involving more than 70 fighter jets, targeting objectives in Tehran” overnight.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the UK is moving additional military assets, including fighter jets, to the Middle East to provide support across the region.
“We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support in the region,” Starmer told reporters en route to the Group of Seven meeting in Canada on Saturday.
The Iranian Red Crescent and local media reported that an Israeli strike hit an ambulance in the country’s northwest on Saturday, killing two people.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported an explosion at a barracks in the city of Urmia, adding “rescuers and ambulances heading towards the barracks came under direct attack from Israel”, leaving two people dead. The Red Crescent confirmed the information in a brief statement of its own.
Tasnim also reported that two Revolutionary Guards were killed in an Israeli strike on a base in central Iran.
“Following the brutal attack by the Zionist regime on the Zarandiyeh Basij base, two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were martyred,” the news agency said, citing the Guards.
The student-run ISNA network, meanwhile, reportedthat  a police chief and another officer were killed in a drone strike about 300 kilometres west of Tehran.
“This morning, police chief Major Habibollah Akbarian, along with second lieutenant Amir Hossein Seifi, were martyred by a drone strike in Asadabad city in the western province of Hamedan,” ISNA reported.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military said that its air strikes on Iran had killed more than 20 Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders.
“Since the beginning of the operation (on Friday), over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime’s security apparatus have been eliminated,” the military said in a statement, naming several top commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the armed forces.
Iran’s state-owned broadcaster Press TV reported that an Israeli F-35 fighter jet had been shot down in the western part of the country on Saturday.
“Iranian Army’s Public Relations Office said in a statement … that its air defence forces had successfully struck and destroyed another F-35 fighter jet belonging to the Israeli regime over the western part of the country,” the report read.
Press TV reported that “the fate of the pilot remains unknown and is currently under investigation”, adding that more information would be released in due course.
Yesterday, IRNA said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.
Earlier today, Iranian media reported Israeli strikes in cities in the west and northwest, which house key defences and military bases.
The Fars and Mehr news agencies said the strikes hit the northwestern city of Tabriz as well as parts of the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah.
The Tabriz Oil Refinery Company, however, denied reports of any attack or damage to its facilities and said its operational activities are being carried out as usual.
Fars said two projectiles hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.
The Tasnim news agency reported on X that an Israeli drone struck the Hakim Children’s Hospital in Tehran.
“A hostile drone launched by the Israeli regime hit Hakim Children’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences,” the agency reported, quoting a statement from the university’s public relations office.
 






Blasts were heard across the capital as Iran activated its air defences against the incoming fire.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.
 


After his country claimed to have struck multiple targets in Iran, Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened that “Tehran will burn” if Iran fired more missiles at Israel.
“The Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages and bringing about a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price because of the criminal harm to Israeli civilians,” Katz was quoted as saying in a statement.
“If [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles toward the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn.”
Israel’s military also said its fighter jets were set to resume striking targets in Tehran, after announcing it had hit air defences in the area of the Iranian capital overnight.
“The way to Iran has been paved,” the military’s chief of staff and air force chief were quoted as saying in an army statement.
The military “is proceeding according to its operational plans, and [Israeli air force] fighter jets are set to resume striking targets in Tehran”, it added.
 


Israel claimed it struck dozens of targets in Tehran overnight, which included “surface-to-air missile infrastructures as part of an effort to dismantle” air defence capabilities around Iran’s capital, Al Jazeera reported.
The Israeli army claimed: “For the first time since the beginning of the war, over 1,500km from Israeli territory, the [Israeli air force] struck defence arrays in the area of Tehran.”
“We damaged — and will continue to damage — strategic sites and enemy sources of knowledge,” the commanding officer of the Israeli air force, MG Tomer Bar, was quoted as saying in a military statement.
Iranian forces shot down Israeli drones on a reconnaissance mission over the northwest, state media reported, as exchanges of fire between the two sides continued.
“Islamic fighters (Iranian forces) in the Salmas border region successfully shot down Israeli drones that had violated the country’s airspace,” state television said, adding that the “drones had entered Iranian airspace on espionage and reconnaissance missions”.
Meanwhile, Baghdad asked Tehran not to target US interests on Iraqi soil, a senior security official said on Saturday amid the heightened tensions.
Fearing being caught up in a regional escalation, the Iraqi government asked Tehran not to strike in its territory, a senior Iraqi security official told AFP.
“The request was made. They promised us positive things,” said the official, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The official added that Tehran has shown understanding with regards to Baghdad’s request.
Meanwhile, IRINN reported that the closure of the strategic Strait of Hormuz was being seriously reviewed by Iran, citing statements by Esmail Kosari, a member of the parliament’s security commission.
The Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Oman and Iran, is the world’s most important gateway for oil shipping.
2 dead, ‘some 40’ wounded in Tel Aviv
In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran. This followed an initial salvo of over 100 missiles late on Friday night under “Operation True Promise 3”.
Tehran Times stated there were “at least five rounds of ballistic missile attacks”.
It further said several of the army’s Arash kamikaze drones “successfully penetrated the occupied territories and struck their targets”, referring to Israel.
A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said the operation would continue for “as long as necessary”, according to Iranian state media IRNA.
 






Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.
The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran
An Israeli military official said Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel, claiming most of which were intercepted. AFP images of the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris.
A man and a woman were killed in Israel and dozens were wounded by a missile that landed near their homes, Israel’s ambulance service said.
Rescue teams were searching the rubble of apartment buildings that were destroyed in Rishon Lezion, a city outside of Tel Aviv.
Earlier today, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said “some 40 people”, besides the woman, were injured by the Iranian strikes.
“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
 






“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.
“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.
He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.
Brigadier General Ahmadi Vahidi, a top advisor to the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, claimed his country hit three Israeli airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported.
Gen Vahidi said the sites included the Nevatim and Ovda airbases, in which the Israeli regime’s command and control, as well as the electronic warfare centre, were located. Other sites, he added, included the Tel Nof airbase near Tel Aviv, Israel’s defence ministry, as well as its industrial and military centres in the capital.
 






In a statement carried by Tasnim, the IRGC said: “In this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation.”
It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.
“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.
A senior Iranian official told CNN that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official told CNN.
Katz said the Iranian leadership had crossed a red line by firing at “civilians” and would “pay a heavy price for it”.
Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an AFP journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.
Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
Resident Chen Gabizon told AFP he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.
“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.

‘Limited damage’ to Fordow, Isfahan nuclear sites
Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.
There was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.
It said that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country’s atomic energy organisation.
“There has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,” Kamalvandi said.
“We had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.”
However, an Israeli military official claimed the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were significantly damaged due to Israeli strikes, according to Reuters.
The official said that it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair damage at the two sites.
Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.
Iranian outlets Mehr and Tasnim also reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports, according to Times of Israel.
Meanwhile, Iran’s civil aviation authority has declared the country’s airspace closed “until further notice”, IRNA reported.

“No flights will be operated at any airports in the country in order to protect the safety of passengers… until further notice,” the news agency said.
Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport was also closed until further notice, a spokeswoman said. “There is no date or day set to reopen the airport,” airport spokeswoman Lisa Diver told AFP.
Yesterday’s attacks prompted several countries in the region to temporarily ground air traffic, though on Saturday morning, Jordan reopened its airspace.
Calls for dialogue
After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, Pope Leo appealed on Saturday for authorities in Iran and Israel to act with “reason” after recent airstrikes and to pursue dialogue.
He told an audience in St. Peter’s Basilica he was following the situation with “great concern”. “In such a delicate moment, I strongly wish to renew an appeal to responsibility and to reason,” said the pope.
“The commitment to building a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through respectful encounters and sincere dialogue to build a lasting peace, founded on justice, fraternity, and the common good,” he said.
“No one should ever threaten the existence of another,” said Leo. “It is the duty of all countries to support the cause of peace, initiating paths of reconciliation and promoting solutions that guarantee security and dignity for all.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi in a phone call on Saturday that Moscow condemns Israel’s use of force against Iran and is ready to help de-escalate the situation in the Middle East.
“Russia is prepared to continue to work to resolve issues surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called for the two nations to cease fire.
“Enough escalation. Time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail,” he wrote on X earlier today.
 






US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.
US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.
Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.
Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC’ air force.
It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.
 






In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.
“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.
 
 

Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel’s attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be “wise” to negotiate over its nuclear programme.
Tehran said Washington would be “responsible for consequences” as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.
The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s sixth round of talks planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.
Iran has consistently denied that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.
Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund 2015 agreement with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.
‘We knew everything’: Trump still hopeful for deal
After the first wave of strikes on Friday, Trump urged Iran to “make a deal” while noting that a 60-day ultimatum had expired. He added that Washington was “hoping to get back to the negotiating table”.
 


After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump told Reuters in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.
“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.
“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.
Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “excellent” and “very successful” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israel’s strikes against Iran a “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved, while also urging Tehran not to target US interests or personnel in the region.
However, a US official told AFP that Washington was helping Israel defend against Iranian missile attacks.
New military brass appointed after commanders killed
The strikes killed Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and Revolutionary Guards’ head Hossein Salami, Iranian media reported.
Tasnim reported today that General Gholamreza Mehrabi, deputy head of intelligence of the armed forces general staff, and General Mehdi Rabbani, deputy head of operations, were confirmed to have been killed in Israel’s attacks from yesterday.

Khamenei swiftly appointed new commanders to replace those killed. Major General Seyyed Abdulrahim Mousavi was appointed to replace Bagheri, while Major Gen Mohammad Pakpour was chosen as the new head of the IRGC, according to IRNA. Gen Amir Hatami was made the new army chief.
 
 

Iran confirmed that the IRGC’s aerospace commander Major Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh had been killed, along with “a group of brave and dedicated fighters”. Khamenei today appointed IRGC Brigadier General Seyyed Majid Mousavi to replace him, Mehr reported.
Meanwhile, three more Iranian nuclear scientists were confirmed dead in Israeli attacks, Mehr news posted on X, taking the total number of experts killed to nine.
Mehr did not specify whether Ali Bakaei Karimi, Mansour Asgari and Saeed Borji were killed in yesterday’s strikes or today’s. The Israeli army also shared the names of the nine scientists in a video on X today.
 


“The senior chain of command of the air force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had assembled in an underground command centre to prepare for an attack on the State of Israel,” the Israeli military said, adding that its attacks had killed most of them.
AFP images showed a gaping hole in the side of a Tehran residential building that appeared to have sustained a targeted strike.
Tasnim news agency said six nuclear scientists were among the dead — namely Abdolhamid Minoochehr, Ahmad Reza Zolfaqari, Seyed Amir Hossein Feqhi, Matlabizadeh, Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi and Fereydoon Abbasi.
Oil prices surged while stocks sank on the Israeli strikes.

Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak told Dawn.com that the body of a man in his mid-20s was recovered from bushes outside the wall of the society near Super Highway.
“The victim sustained injuries to his head,” he added.
Khattak highlighted the possibility that he might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car.
He also said that the body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that although the victim was in the advanced stage of decomposition, there were head injuries.
“The cause of death was a head injury,” Dr Syed said, adding that samples had been collected.
Earlier this year, Mustafa Amir, a 23-year-old youth, was kidnapped and allegedly murdered by his friends in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA). According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
In Feb, police arrested Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect, for injuring officers while resisting his detention. His friend Sheraz aka Shavez Bukhari was remanded by an ATC.
Armaghan was sent to prison in March after he refused to record his confessional statement while a magistrate observed that the suspect was not in stable condition to record his confession.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14231129ac94234.jpg?r=231321' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917123/tens-of-thousands-of-americans-join-protest-rallies-ahead-of-trumps-military-parade' target='_blank'><strong>Tens of thousands of Americans join protest rallies ahead of Trump’s military parade</strong></a><br><p>Tens of thousands of Americans attended rallies on Saturday to protest United States President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown in major cities from New York to Atlanta to Los Angeles, on a day marred by the assassination of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota.
The protests marked the largest outpouring of opposition to Trump’s presidency since he returned to power in January, and came the same day that thousands of military personnel, vehicles and aircraft would march through and fly over Washington DC in a parade celebrating the US Army’s 250th anniversary.
Saturday is also Trump’s 79th birthday.
The Republican president has ordered National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles, a heavily Democratic city — a deployment that California Governor Gavin Newsom has challenged in court.
Anti-Trump groups planned nearly 2,000 demonstrations of varying sizes across the country to coincide with the parade. Many are taking place under the theme ‘No Kings’, asserting that no individual is above the law.
All planned ‘No Kings’ protests in Minnesota were cancelled following what Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said was the “politically motivated assassination” of one Democratic lawmaker and wounding of a second.
A Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were killed early on Saturday, while a second lawmaker and his spouse were wounded in a separate attack, Walz said.
“An unspeakable tragedy has unfolded in Minnesota —my good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” he told reporters. “Our state lost a great leader.”
Walz said that in a second attack, Senator John Hoffman and his wife, of Champlin, were shot multiple times, underwent surgery and that he was “cautiously optimistic” that they would survive “this assassination attempt”.
“This was an act of targeted political violence,” he said. “Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”

Law enforcement authorities said the gunman was impersonating a police officer and escaped after exchanging fire with police who responded to the attacks.
A large-scale search for the suspect was underway, they said.
Trump condemned the shooting, saying, “Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.
“I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, calling the incident “terrible”.
 


“The ghastly targeted shootings of Senator Hoffman and Representative Hortman are not just horrific, they’re acts of political extremism and an assault on our democracy itself,” said Democratic US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “This is where hate and violent rhetoric lead.”
People heading into Washington for the parade encountered a massive security presence, with some 30 kilometres of 2.4 metre-high black fencing, much of it reinforced with concrete traffic barriers, cordoning off streets and surrounding landmarks including the Washington Monument.
The celebrations will cost the US Army between $25 million and $45m, US officials have told Reuters. That includes the parade itself as well as the cost of moving equipment and housing and feeding the troops.
Critics have called the parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially given that Trump has said he wants to slash costs throughout the federal government.
Festive atmosphere
A festive atmosphere had taken hold in front of City Hall in Los Angeles, where hundreds of people had gathered an hour before the main ‘No Kings’ protest was set to begin.
A drum circle featuring Native American dancers was animating the crowd, where scores were waving American and Mexican flags, amid a heavy law enforcement presence.
Sergio Lopez, 44, a gay man and Navy veteran who served in Iraq from 2002 until 2004 and was brought to the US from Mexico at the age of 1, said he was at the demonstration because he felt under attack on several fronts.
“I didn’t fight for my country to be stripped of my rights and to be targeted by my own government,” Lopez said. “We’re supposed to be the best country in the world. How can we be that if we are targeting the immigrants who helped build this country?”
In a sign of the widespread nature of the protests, small groups of mostly middle-aged and elderly people holding signs and protesting Trump were scattered at intersections across affluent northwest Washington and its Maryland suburbs, urging motorists to honk their horns in support and holding signs saying things including ‘Honor Troops (not Trump)’, ‘No Kings’ and ‘No Kings since 1776’.

At least one organisation, RefuseFascism.org, has a permit to hold a march in central Washington that will culminate in a rally opposite the White House.
Trump has warned people against protesting at the parade itself, saying that “they’re going to be met with very big force.”
Members of the far-right Proud Boys appeared at an Atlanta ‘No Kings’ protest, wearing the group’s distinctive black and yellow colours.
The protests and any response by law enforcement agencies will form a contrasting backdrop to the day-long celebration of the US Army’s history, which will seek to honour different eras of military history with uniforms and military weaponry from those periods.
While the Army has said the parade will take place come rain or shine, weather forecasts for Saturday evening show the potential for heavy thunderstorms in the Washington area.
Defenders of the plans say the Army’s 250th anniversary is a unique event that deserves an outsized celebration.
The display of US military hardware will take place shortly after one of the nation’s closest allies, Israel, launched a barrage of strikes across Iran, which has threatened a harsh response.
Rare spectacle
Military parades in the United States are rare. Other countries usually stage them to celebrate victories in battle or showcase military might.
In 1991, tanks and thousands of troops paraded through Washington to celebrate the ousting of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in the Gulf War.
Thousands of agents, officers and specialists will be deployed from law enforcement agencies from across the country and drones operated by the Secret Service will keep watch overhead.
The Federal Aviation Administration will close down arrivals and departures at Washington’s Reagan National Airport during the peak of the celebration.

The US Army has brought nearly 7,000 troops into Washington, along with 150 vehicles, including more than 25 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker armoured vehicles, four Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicles, and artillery pieces including the M777 and M119.
The flyover will include Apache and Black Hawk helicopters along with Chinooks. Older aircraft like the World War II-era B-25 bomber and P-51 Mustang will also take part.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14212344cf76eb4.jpg?r=222332' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917132/uzbekistan-airlines-flies-inaugural-pakistani-route-paa' target='_blank'><strong>Uzbekistan Airlines flies inaugural Pakistani route: PAA</strong></a><br><p>Uzbekistan Airlines on Saturday flew its inaugural Pakistani route from Islamabad to Tashkent, marking a key moment in connectivity between the two nations, a statement from the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said.
Uzbekistan announced earlier this year that air routes between Karachi, Samarkand and Bukhara would be launched, describing it as a significant step to foster closer ties between the two nations.
According to a PAA statement, the flight took off at 1:09pm with 126 passengers on board, with Zone 1 of Islamabad International Airport specially adorned with colourful balloons for the milestone.
“The event was graced by the esteemed ambassadors of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan,” the statement read, adding that the Chief Operating Officer of Islamabad Airport, the managing director of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation and the Country Manager of Uzbekistan Airlines also attended.
“Guests warmly welcomed passengers at Stand 3 and a formal cake-cutting ceremony was held in the upper lounge area (A5) to commemorate the launch,” the statement added. “The entire event was seamlessly organised with the dedicated support and coordination of airport teams under the Pakistan Airports Authority.”
In February this year, Pakistan and Uzbekistan agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2 billion as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
Addressing a joint press conference with PM Shehbaz, President Mirziyoyev said: “We came to the conclusions on different spheres and mutual trade turnover had exceeded $400 million, and we have plans to increase that to $2bn.”
He termed the negotiations between them “very fruitful”, adding that there was a “new direction” for future goals.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609191-pakistan-stood-resolutely-with-iran-in-face-of-israels-unjustified-aggression-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan decries Israeli strikes, affirms full solidarity with Iran</strong></a><br><p>

There were reports of new Israeli strikes in Iran earlier today as Tel Aviv warned “Tehran will burn” after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli onslaught on its nuclear facilities that killed its top generals.
The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.
According to PTV News, the PM spoke over the phone to Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, informing him that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the “brotherly people of Iran against Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression”.
“He (the PM) strongly condemned the Israeli attacks against Iran, which are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a complete violation of the UN Charter and international law,” the report read. The PM added that Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
“The prime minister condemned Israel’s provocations and adventurism, calling them a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” PTV News reported. “He also strongly condemned Israel’s unabated acts of brutal genocide against the brave Palestinians.”
According to PTV News, PM Shehbaz urged the international community and the UN to take “immediate and credible steps” against Israeli aggression, stating that Pakistan is fully committed to promoting peace in the region.
Pezeshkian thanked the PM for Pakistan’s support, saying that this was a “reflection of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries”.
PTV News reported that Pezeshkian apprised PM Shehbaz of Iran’s perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, especially Islamic countries, to work together to confront these threats. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.
 






‘Cannot afford Iraq 2.0 or WWIII’: Bilawal
While addressing a press conference in Brussels, Bilawal said, “We certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.
“We will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders. Be it with Afghanistan, be it with Iran, be it with India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.”
 






He said that it had become “far too easy to have a war every month” and added that war had become the “default setting” that “whenever there is a conflict or dispute, to launch into a full-scale war”.
Bilawal called on the international community to “immediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine”.
“We cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests,” he added.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.
The delegation comprises Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
‘Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests’: Khawaja Asif
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said that Pakistan will “safeguard Iran’s interests” amid exchanges of missiles between Tehran and Israel, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
Condemning the Israeli attack on Pakistan’s “neighbour and fraternal country” during a session of parliament, the defence minister urged that a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) be convened to launch an initiative that “manifests the unity of [the] Muslim Ummah”.
“Pakistan stands firm on its traditional stance, as it has neither recognised Israel nor established relations with it,” Asif said. “Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests at all international fora, including the United Nations.”</p><small>2025-06-14 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609184-sindh-warns-centre-over-development-budget-calls-for-end-to-stepmotherly-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad lashes out at Centre over sidelining Sindh in federal projects</strong></a><br><p>

The NEV policy incl­udes a subsidy of Rs50,000 for electric mot­orcycles and Rs200,000 for rickshaws, with a total subsidy allocation of Rs4 billion. In addition, the policy provides for subsidies and support to establish electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging stations.
The PM issued these orders while chairing a high-level meeting today to review and discuss the policy framework.
“[Pakistan needs] swift and priority-based measures to promote electric motorcycles, scooters, three-wheelers, cars, and buses,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.
He also underscored the importance of establishing charging infrastructure, including charging stations and battery swapping facilities, to support the expansion of the EV ecosystem.
“Relevant industries should be facilitated to enhance the local manufacturing capacity of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers,” the PM added.
The meeting was attended by Federal Ministers Rana Tanveer Hussain, Ahmad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, and other senior government officials.
Earlier this week, 57 manufacturers were granted licences to produce EVs, supported by fiscal incentives, tax exemptions, and reduced charging tariffs aligned with the government’s ‘Clean Green Pakistan’ and ‘Make in Pakistan’ initiatives.
Meanwhile, the Sindh government on June 11 decided to purchase more buses and allocate funds for EV taxis and scooters in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon, where various projects, including the People’s Bus Service, EV scooters, and others, were reviewed and discussed.</p><small>2025-06-14 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609182-rocket-fired-at-house-of-pms-aide-mubarak-zeb-in-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Rocket fired at house of PM's aide Mubarak Zeb in Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>

But it was an edgy finish as they took 27.4 overs to slowly score the 69 runs needed to secure success on the fourth day at Lord’s after resuming at 213-2 overnight.
In so doing, South Africa completed a successful pursuit of the joint second-highest winning fourth-innings total in test history at the London venue.
It was a first major cricket triumph for South Africa, who had earned an unwanted reputation for failure when on the cusp of victory over the last decades in limited overs competitions.
This was their first appearance in the WTC final, with opener Aiden Markram delivering a heroic innings of 136 to ensure success.
Markram, who reached his century late in the third day, added 34 more runs on Saturday, accumulating carefully before falling to a sharp catch by Travis Head with six runs needed to win.
Kyle Verreynne hit the winning run and was four not out at the end along with David Bedingham, who scored an unbeaten 21.
Nerves
“It was the most nervous I’ve ever been. I didn’t want to come out and bat, but when Aiden went out, I had to,” said Verreynne.
South Africa started the fourth day as favourites to win, but nervy, given a litany of past disasters, and would have been further on edge when captain Temba Bavuma was out in the third over of the morning.
A rising delivery from Australia skipper Pat Cummins took an edge and saw Bavuma depart, having added only one run to his overnight total of 65.
Australia made two unsuccessful reviews of not-out decisions as they sought a further breakthrough before Mitchell Starc clean bowled Tristan Stubbs for eight, with 41 runs still needed.
 
 

Markram and Bedingham then diligently put together a 35-run partnership to see them to the brink of success, before the win was secured in the last over before lunch.
South Africa, which came into the contest as underdogs, won the toss on the opening day and gambled by putting Australia into bat. But with Kagiso Rabada returning figures of 5-51, they were vindicated as the defending champions were dismissed for 212.
South Africa’s reply of 138 meant Australia had a 74-run lead, significantly increased after scoring 207 in their second innings, with their tail order recovering after they had slumped to 73-7.
But South Africa profited from a dramatic change in the pitch conditions, after 24 wickets fell on the first two days to patiently bat themselves to a landmark victory.</p><small>2025-06-14 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14163008dcfcddd.jpg?r=163222' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917110/canadas-sikhs-voice-outrage-over-modi-g7-invitation' target='_blank'><strong>Canada’s Sikhs voice outrage over Modi G7 invitation</strong></a><br><p>Members of Canada’s Sikh community, who were warned by police that their lives were at risk and allege the Indian government is responsible for the threat, are incensed by Ottawa’s invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Modi, although India is not a G7 member, to attend the summit, which starts on Sunday, as a guest. It will be Modi’s first visit to Canada in a decade and a diplomatic test for Carney, a political neophyte.
Canada’s relationship with India has been tense since former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2023 accused India’s government of involvement in the June 18, 2023 murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.
Modi’s government has denied involvement in Nijjar’s killing and has accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
“‘Outrage’ is the kind of term that I’ve heard from people,” Sikh activist Moninder Singh, a friend of Nijjar, said of the invitation.
He and other Sikh leaders plan to hold a protest in Ottawa on Saturday.
Carney, locked in a trade war with the United States, is trying to shore up alliances elsewhere and diversify Canada’s exports. Carney told reporters he invited India due to its importance in global supply chains.
 
 

India’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a Thursday press briefing that a meeting between Modi and Carney “will offer an important opportunity for them to exchange views on bilateral and global issues and explore pathways to set or reset the relationship”.
Sikhs face threats
That rationale rings hollow for Singh, who lives in British Columbia. He has received multiple warnings from police that his life was at risk. One such warning forced him from his home for months in 2023 for his children’s safety.
“On a personal level, and on a community level, as well, it was deeply insulting … Sikh lives aren’t as important as the fifth-largest economy in the world that needs to be at the table,” he said.
A spokesperson for Carney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in October that they had communicated more than a dozen threats to people like Singh who are advocating for the creation of a Sikh homeland carved out of India.
In October, under Trudeau, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, linking them to Nijjar’s murder and alleging a broader government effort to target Indian dissidents in Canada through killings, extortion, the use of organised crime and clandestine information-gathering.
India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats and called the allegations preposterous and politically motivated. Canada has said it does not have evidence linking Modi to the threats.
The tension has thrust Canada’s Sikh community — the largest outside India’s Sikh-majority Punjab state — into the spotlight. Singh said there should have been conditions on Modi’s invitation.
“Any meetings with them should have been under the conditions that Mr. Modi and his government would take responsibility for what has been uncovered and cooperate, but none of that happened.”
Carney told reporters Modi had agreed to “law enforcement dialogue”.
Jaiswal said Indian and Canadian law enforcement agencies will continue to cooperate in some ways.
Some activists and politicians in Canada have accused Carney of putting economic issues ahead of human rights concerns. But Sanjay Ruparelia, a politics professor at Toronto Metropolitan University, said the prime minister is simply being practical.
“[Carney’s] watchword since he’s come to office is pragmatism. And this is very much a pragmatic, realpolitik decision.”</p><small>2025-06-14 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/140839113f67762.jpg?r=084036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917045/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‘grave threat to world peace’ posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.
Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.
Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy
Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.
“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.
She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned resumption of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.
DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.
“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.
“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”
Also briefing the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.
He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.
“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.
He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.
“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”
Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.
“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”
Pakistan came out strongly in support of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.
The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.
 






When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.
It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.
He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/14151153345f7bd.jpg?r=151620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107/delhi-launches-inspection-of-boeing-787s-after-air-india-crash' target='_blank'><strong>Delhi launches inspection of Boeing 787s after Air India crash</strong></a><br><p>India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India crash that claimed at least 279 lives this week, the country’s aviation minister said on Saturday, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.
The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.
“We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi, without saying if the checks will apply to all Indian airlines.
“Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.” Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.
The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday told Reuters the Indian government was considering that as an option.
Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down, Reuters has reported.
Forensic teams are still looking for the second black box as they probe why the plane lost height and crashed straight after takeoff.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at B.J. Medical College, told reporters.
Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.
The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022. Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.
Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.
 
 

Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from authorities and was “very hassled”.
“We have lost our children … we are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children. Tell us when they are going to release their bodies,” Memon said.

Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it would take 72 hours for DNA profiling. “The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.
Most bodies in the crash were badly charred, and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.
Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.</p><small>2025-06-14 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609160-tensions-to-increase-sans-pakistan-india-dialogue-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Tensions to increase sans Pakistan-India dialogue, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

Last month, an improvised explosive device (IED) had detonated outside the residence of MNA Zeb, partially damaging the house, police had said.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique, told Dawn.com that the rocket was fired at the residence of MNA Mubarak Zeb in Bajaur.
“However, it struck the MNA’s neighbour’s house, resulting in damage to the house walls and gate,” he added.
The MNA confirmed the attack in a post on X as well, adding that there were no casualties in the attack.
 






DPO Rafique added that there were no human casualties.
He said that miscreants had attacked the MNA’s house for the second time in the last two months.
He said that a search operation is underway in the area to track down the terrorists who launched the rocket at Zeb’s house.
Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Earlier in the week, a man was killed and two women were wounded after a mortar shell fired from Afghanistan’s side hit their house in the hilly area of Bajaur district’s Salarzai tehsil, police and residents said.
In April, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.
Also in April, eight people, including three security personnel and five residents, were injured after a roadside bomb targeted a vehicle of the Frontier Corps in the same district.</p><small>2025-06-14 09:35</small></div><hr>
