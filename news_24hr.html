• Advises UK to take balanced stance, raise rights issues, and consult Kashmiri diaspora
LONDON: The United Kingdom (UK) Parliament has called for renewed diplomatic engagement between India and Pakis­tan over the Kashmir dispute, highlighting human rights concerns and urging the UK government to adopt a more active, balanced role in addressing the region’s long-standing tensions.
In a report published by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Commi­ttee, as part of a wider inquiry into the UK’s strategy for South Asia, lawmakers expressed alarm over the deteriorating situation in India-held Kashmir since August 2019, when the Indian government revoked the region’s special constitutional status under the Article 370.
The report cited increased military presence, restrictions on civil liberties, limitations on press freedom and arbitrary detentions, concluding that “there had been a marked erosion of democratic rights in the region.”
 
 

The committee also examined governance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. While acknowledging the situation in these areas differs from Indian-occupied Kashmir, the report noted ongoing concerns about democratic limitations and the lack of full constitutional representation. It recommended the UK government continue to monitor human rights and political conditions on both sides of the Line of Control.
The cross-party committee called on the British government to make greater use of its diplomatic channels and historic ties with both New Delhi and Islamabad to encourage dialogue. While reaffirming the UK’s position that the Kashmir issue “must be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan,” the report stressed this “should not prevent Britain from raising concerns, especially over human rights violations.”
Parliamentarians urged the Foreign, Common­wealth and Development Office (FCDO) to press both countries to allow greater access for international observers, including British parliamentarians and diplomats, to visit both sides of the disputed territory.
They also recommended the UK take a more balanced approach, engaging with both governments equally and avoiding any perception of partisanship, while ensuring its diplomacy is rooted in British values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.
The report further advised that the UK should listen closely to the views of the large Kashmiri diaspora in Britain, encouraging the government to be mindful of community concerns and to use its influence to foster peace and reconciliation.
 
 

The report, titled “India and Pakistan: a UK foreign policy strategy for the 2020s,” forms part of a broader examination of British foreign policy priorities. It reflects growing parliamentary concern over rising authoritarianism in parts of South Asia and the potential consequences of inaction on long-standing regional conflicts.
While acknowledging sensitivities, the committee argued that the UK “cannot remain passive in the face of growing instability in Kashmir.” It concluded that discreet but principled diplomacy, consistent rights monitoring, and a willingness to engage with both sides could play a constructive role.
The UK government is expected to respond formally to the committee’s recommendations in the coming months.
Kashmir dispute could spark nuclear war
Also, the British Par­liament criticised India’s aggressive behaviour, warning that the longstanding Kashmir dispute with Pakistan poses a serious threat to regional stability and could potentially escalate into a nuclear conflict, APP adds.
A 42-page report recently made public highlights the clashing approaches of the two South Asian nations, with India favouring bilateral dialogue and Pakistan advocating for international mediation in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
 
 

The report says that India used a “suspicious incident in occupied Kashmir” as a justification to take military action against Pakistan — a move the report says threatens regional peace.
It also criticises India for “creating obstacles in the way of a solution to the Kashmir issue” by disregarding UN mandates.
The report further accuses the international community, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, of inaction on the matter.
According to the report, Pakistan adopted a defensive strategy “within the framework of responsibility, patience and international law” during the recent conflict.

Many things have changed since it was assiduously crafted with the help of the World Bank in 1960.
While the treaty provides a dispute-resolution mechanism that has been used in the past to address complaints, this time the issue has taken a sordid turn. At the heart of the matter are two things most responsible for the current impasse — i) demographic changes that are outstripping supply with shrinking resources and rising demand, ii) the emergence of politics of hate and division fuelling religious nationalism to fan public sentiment.
The post-Cold War attempt to create a rules-based international order is under assault from a rising wave of populist demagoguery. The inciting rhetoric takes different shapes and forms, but the message of punitive action remains the same.
Now it is the heft of nations that determines acceptance or rejection of its unilateral actions by the global community. The arbitrary suspension of the IWT is part of this wider malaise. Nations are now looking increasingly inward, taking a more distributive approach to negotiations and using muscular diplomacy to assert their agenda.
The IWT has a past history of invoking the dispute-resolution clause.

The issues between the two countries are no longer merely about territorial disputes but have taken a more insidious turn.

In 2007, the dispute resolution process over India’s design of the Baglihar hydroelectric plant on the Chenab was addressed by a neutral expert to determine the freeboard of India’s proposed dam.
In 2013, the Court of Arbitration rendered a decision on India’s diversion of a tributary of the Jhelum for the Kishenganga hydroelectric project. India was allowed to divert water for the Kishenganga project while maintaining a minimum specified storage in the reservoir and minimum release of nine cubic metres of water per second down river into the Jhelum tributary.
However, trouble started brewing in 2016 following the unresolved technical differences with regard to the Kishenganga hydroelectric project and India’s announcement of starting the Ratle hydroelectric project on the Chenab.
The strident tone adopted by India after the 2014 elections has continued to grow and alter political thinking with a palpable shift in its relationship dynamics with Pakistan. The already tense bilateral relations came under acute strain after the Pulwama terror attack in India for which it blamed Pakistan (without proof). This also mar­ked the beginning of public statements from India threatening to use water as a weapon to punish Pa­­­kistan for its alleged role in sponsoring terrorism.
The revocation of Article 370 in 2019 stripping Indian-occupied Kashmir of its special status and its sharp rejection by Pakistan further poisoned the chalice.
In 2016 when Pakistan invoked the arbitral process via a Request For Arbitration, the water was already turning from muddy to murky. The RFA outlined seven disputes related to the disputed projects related to design and permissibility of pondage levels, submerged power intakes, low-level sediment outlets, spillway designs, and permissible freeboard intakes. India’s refusal to participate in the arbitral process led to a default appointment procedure for a five-year pause (2016-22) imposed by the World Bank. With heightened levels of animosity and a volley of threats hurled at Pakistan, India decried the ‘illegitimacy’ of the Court of Arbitration via a letter to the World Bank (Dec 21, 2022).
Parallel to this, India requested the appointment of a neutral expert under the Indus treaty. Pakistan’s refusal to participate resulted in the default appointment procedure for the appointment of a neutral expert after a five-year pause. In 2023, the Court of Arbitration issued an award upholding its competence for addressing the matter. In 2025, the neutral expert also issued an award upholding its competence to address the seven points of conflict.
The main problem is not overlapping jurisdictional competencies and their inconsistent outcomes. The real issue is the deepening divide between India and Pakistan. The issues between the two countries are no longer merely about territorial disputes but have taken a more insidious turn. The last 15 years have seen a sharp increase in animosity bordering on intense hatred. This trend has to be curbed.
The tragic and condemnable Pahalgam incide­nt has, once again, ignited passions blinding reason and bringing the two countries to the brink of war. The unilateral suspension of the IWT by India is a sign of a new trend that blurs the line between separate incidents and uses a no-holds-barred approach to retaliation. The two countries have a history of bad blood laden with accusations of interference with the intent of fomenting disaffection and destabilsation. Such passionate feelings based on the politics of identity are a dangerous portent for the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The multilayered dispute resolution mechanism of the fraying IWT must be seen in the context of the fractious geopolitical history of the region marked by its hydrological topography.
The IWT can no longer only be seen through the technical lens of neutral experts. Given the relationship dynamics the intent and ability to do harm needs to be examined by a Court of Arbitration. Judicial interpretation has the provision for taking a broader view while neutral experts are limited by their narrow mandate. Both countries can do more with less water if hate and hostility are not part of the equation.
When the dust has settled, both countries need to embark on a sincere journey of truth and reconciliation. The need for working together has never been greater than it is today.

Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-19 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/190903262d3367d.jpg?r=090350' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911926/famine-in-waiting' target='_blank'><strong>Famine in waiting</strong></a><br><p>FOOD insecurity across the world has reached unprecedented levels, with conflict, economic shocks, and climate extremes pushing millions to the edge of starvation, according to the Global Report on Food Crises.
The situation is most harrowing in Gaza, where the entire population of 2.1m is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. As of March 2024, more than half the population was classified in IPC Phase 4 Emergency levels, while an alarming 50pc faced Catastrophe conditions (IPC Phase 5), the final stage before famine is officially declared.
 
 

This is not just a humanitarian failure but a result of deliberate policy and sustained conflict. Gaza’s economy has collapsed under a 17-year blockade and repeated military escalations. By the end of 2024, 75pc of cropland, 57pc of greenhouses, and 68pc of wells had been destroyed. In north Gaza and Gaza governorates, 70pc of the population was surviving under Catastrophe-level conditions, relying almost entirely on inadequate humanitarian aid. Food prices skyrocketed, with wheat flour prices increasing by 3,000pc between February and April 2025.
Efforts at mitigation remain woefully insufficient. Humanitarian access has been severely restricted, with aid trucks entering Gaza far below pre-conflict levels, and the risk of famine remains persistent throughout 2025. The global community must push for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access.
While Gaza’s plight is the most severe, Pakistan too faces a worrying food security outlook. Although food inflation fell to 0.3pc by December 2024, down from double digits earlier in the year, poverty and unemployment continue to hinder access to food. The 2022 floods left lasting scars, and extreme weather events in 2023 and 2024 further eroded livelihoods, particularly in rural Balochistan, Sindh and KP. These regions also face deteriorating water security, further compounding agricultural losses and pushing subsistence farmers into deeper debt traps.
As of the latest assessments, 11m people in Pakistan remain in IPC Phase 3 Crisis or worse, with 2.2m in Emergency conditions. High levels of acute malnutrition are particularly alarming in Sindh and KP, with a significant number of children born with low birth weight and a large burden of diarrhoea and respiratory infections exacerbating the crisis. Compounding these challenges is the global reduction in humanitarian funding, which has curtailed food assistance programmes.
 
 

Immediate policy interventions are needed. The centre and provinces must strengthen social safety nets, ensure nutrition support for mothers and children, and invest in climate-resilient agriculture. Without decisive action, Pakistan risks falling deeper into a chronic cycle of hunger and poverty.
In a world where millions go to bed hungry, and where children’s futures are traded for geopolitical gains, we must ask: how long can humanity endure this?

Never before had the two countries attacked each other’s mainland with missile and air strikes as well as deployed new generation technology and weapons including drones. And never before had they edged so close to all-out war after becoming nuclear-wea­pon states.
The rapid escalation in the military confrontation went beyond the traditional battleground of occupied Kashmir and much further than previous crises to test deterrence. This was unprecedented but the way the crisis was defu­sed — by third-party intervention — followed a well-rehearsed path and mimicked the past.
The military, diplomatic and international dimensions of the crisis need to be carefully examined to make an assessment about the future. Predictably, both countries have drawn very different conclusions from the crisis. The Indian claim, voiced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is that a ‘new normal’ against terrorism has been established by India’s military actions, and that in future any terrorist attack will be deemed an act of war and responded to militarily by this ‘new’ doctrine.
 
 

Pakistan sees its kinetic response in the crisis to have demonstrated that conventional deterrence worked as it prevented India from escalating to an even bigger conflict and thwarted India’s effort to expand space for conventional war under the nuclear overhang. India’s loss of several Rafale aircraft symbolised the costs imposed by Pakistan’s retaliation. That and its ability to strike at multiple targets in the Indian mainland showed its conventional capabilities were able to force a ceasefire and neutralise India’s aims of ‘limited war’.
The reality is that India failed to achieve its military objectives in the conflict in spite of Modi’s unsubstantiated assertions of having destroyed “terrorist infrastructure”. It miscalculated the consequences of its actions. Its resort to a military ‘solution’ for a terror attack backfired. The claim that a new norm has been created by India flies in the face of facts.
The assertion that henceforth India would respond militarily if there is another terror attack is easier said than done, given the unedifying outcome of the latest crisis for New Delhi. With the credibility of Pakistan’s conventional deterrence re-established if not strengthened, the costs for India could be even higher the next time around for it to consider similar action. India got a new normal but not the one it wanted.

An uneasy truce prevails between India and Pakistan with dim prospects of any diplomatic re-engagement.

As both countries have drawn sharply conflicting conclusions and lessons from their military confrontation this heightens the risk for miscalculation and creates uncertainty ahead, especially if sustained communication is not established between them.
 
 

Contact between the DGMOs after the ceasefire has been important but the communication channel has to go beyond a technical or tactical level. There is little immediate possibility of this. This continues to make the situation fraught and unpredictable especially as Modi has declared India has “only suspended” military operations.
The diplomatic costs of the crisis were even greater for India than the military costs. By its reckless military actions, New Delhi lost significant international ground as global attention shifted from terrorism to the danger of a full-fledged war with India climbing up the escalatory ladder. This showed how poorly the Modi government assessed the international environment. The clash brought global attention back to Kashmir, to the Modi government’s discomfiture.
In the biggest blow to New Delhi, President Donald Trump in announcing the ceasefire offered to mediate on Kashmir. While this will be rejected by India, it catapults Kashmir to the global stage. India also failed to elicit any international support for its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty. Even the US asked India to observe the treaty in private conversations with Indian officials.
 
 

Moreover, US intervention to defuse the crisis and Trump’s statements after the ceasefire re-hyphenated India and Pakistan, which India has tried so hard over the years to delink. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran acknowledged to the Financial Times that the crisis set back New Delhi’s efforts to dissuade countries from treating India and Pakistan “on a par, and relations with each as interlinked”. “That hyphenation is now back,” he added. If a top Indian geopolitical goal is to join the world’s big league this crisis has produced the opposite outcome for New Delhi.
The Modi government also misjudged the evolving American position, assuming it would receive unequivocal support from Washington for its military action to avenge the Pahalgam terror incident. But the Trump administration sought to defuse the crisis from its very onset, urging restraint on New Delhi (and Islamabad) both publicly and privately.
As the crisis escalated, US diplomatic intervention intensified. This was reflected in multiple phone calls made by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to top leaders in both countries and finally Vice President J.D. Vance’s intercession with PM Modi when the crisis looked like spinning out of control.
This led to the ceasefire President Trump announced and claimed credit for. The Indians neither publicly welcomed his announcement nor acknowledged the US role in ending the crisis. Modi made no mention of this in his post-ceasefire speech. Later, Indian officials refuted the US role. This contrasted sharply with the synchronous communication and close understanding between Pakistan and China throughout the crisis including in vital intelligence cooperation.
 
 

As for the political ramifications of the crisis, this provided a contrasting picture. The outcome divided India while uniting Pakistan. Modi came under mounting domestic pressure to explain what he achieved by Operation Sindoor. His right-wing base was furious at the truce.
With his strongman image dented, the opposition said Modi had much to answer for while the Congress president criticised the government for “strategic missteps”. In Pakistan there was jubilation at the outcome, rallying of national unity and renewal of national confidence while the public standing and reputation of the armed forces went up exponentially.
An uneasy truce now prevails between India and Pakistan with a fragile ceasefire that is being implemented in phases. Confidence-building measures are being taken to reduce military tensions and the “level of alertness”. But it will be a mistake to conclude that ‘normalcy’ will return anytime soon. The outlook remains troubled and fraught with uncertainty.

The development follows a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed as “Operation Sindoor”.
The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll.
Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.
He wrote: “Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynching, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens.
“The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly [sic] but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy,” Mahmudabad noted.
“The grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united in its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea,” he further said.
 
 

The Haryana State Commission interpreted his remarks as “an attempt to vilify national military actions”, the Hindustan Times reported.
The Haryana State Commission for Women had taken suo motu cognisance of his remarks on Col Qureshi, saying they undermined women officers in the Indian armed forces and fomented communal discord.
ThePrint, in an editorial, said: “The vicious hounding and egregious arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for expressing his opinion is a shameful insult to our millennia-old democratic tradition.
“His argument about war and domestic politics is a constitutional freedom. As is your right to disagree. Calling it an insult to women or military is senseless.”
Separately, Indian police have arrested travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra along with five others from Punjab and Haryana over alleged espionage for Pakistan, according to Indian media.
Malhotra, a 33-year-old from Haryana’s Hisar district who runs the YouTube channel ‘Travel With Jo’, was detained under India’s Official Secrets Act 1923 for allegedly “transmitting sensitive information to Pakistani operatives”, according to India News Network (INN).
 
 

According to the FIR, she came into contact with the alleged Pakistani operative two years ago and visited Pakistan twice, The Hindu reported.
Dawn.com has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on the claims.
Malhotra had uploaded videos on her YouTube channel of her visits to renowned Sikh sites Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab, with the latest published in March 2025.
According to the Minority Rights Group, Sikhs have a “significant” presence in Haryana and form a majority in Punjab.
The vlogger’s father, who retired from the Haryana electricity department, denied the allegations and said her daughter was being implicated, The Hindu added.
Those arrested with Malhotra included a security guard, a university student and civilians alleged to have “received money or instructions from Pakistani contacts”, according to INN.
Among the suspects are Guzala from Malerkotla in Punjab and her “friend” Banu Nasreena, who were granted Pakistani visas in April 2025, the report claimed.
Also named in the case is Arman from Haryana’s Nuh district, who allegedly provided Indian SIM cards and transferred money on behalf of the operatives.
In another crackdown, Assam Police, acting on army intelligence, arrested seven people and busted a racket allegedly using fake SIM cards to share sensitive information with “Pakistani agents”, Times of India reported.
Other than those seven, 14 were under interrogation.
 
 

Times of India quoted Assam police chief Harmeet Singh as saying that police teams were dispatched to Telangana’s Hyderabad as well as cities in Rajasthan and Assam.
Saddik, Arif Khan, and Sajid were arrested in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and Alwar, while Akeek was taken into custody at the airport in Assam’s Guwahati, Singh said.
Arsad was arrested at the New Delhi airport, Mofijul in Telangana, Jakariya in Assam’s Bilasipara town, Time of India reported.
 


Pakistani journalists take reports with a grain of salt
On the other side of the border, Pakistani journalists and commentators have cast doubts on the reports by Indian media, which aired multiple fake news stories during the recent tensions between the two countries.
 
 

A New York Times article yesterday also highlighted how Indian media “amplified falsehoods”, noting that “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war”.
Journalist Hamid Mir, while responding to an Indian user who shared videos of her blog and accused her of being a spy, wrote on his X account that Malhotra “was not spying and only making a video for her YouTube channel”.
“Spies don’t make videos for public use […] they make secret videos for secret use. Pakistan doesn’t need these kind of spies.”
 






Another Pakistani journalist, Ammara Ahmed, wrote: “Jyoti Malhotra deserves a good lawyer and a fair trial.”
 






Journalist Ailia Zehra, who covers politics and human rights, described the entire episode as “ridiculous”.
“What state secrets could a YouTuber possibly have? Ridiculous,” she wrote.
 






Podcaster Shehzad Ghias Shaikh noted: “The message is quite clear, no Indian content creator is to have any interaction with Pakistan or they will be penalised.

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court was upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty.
Justice Hashim Kakar would lead the three-member bench, which includes Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi.
 
 

The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case would be taken up as well. An appeal by Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas being heard.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
Case history
Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
 
 

In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s appeal, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
The murder
After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father.
In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.
 
 

The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.
Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.
Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.
Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.

According to media reports, the foreign ministers of the three nations will meet to discuss issues of mutual interest, including regional stability and cooperation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to leave today (Monday) for an official visit to Beijing from May 19 to 22 to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability, the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is expected to arrive in Beijing tomorrow.
The talks follow the recently brokered ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and amid reports that Afghanistan was supporting India in the conflict with Pakistan. Pakis­tan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said in a statement on Sunday that no country was supporting India except Israel and Afghanistan.
 
 

Mr Dar’s visit is being seen as significant as tensions remained high in the region following a tense military standoff between Pakistan and India over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. India blamed the attack on Pakistan without evidence.
On the night of May 6-7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down six Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Paki­stan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid the escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.
According to the Foreign Office, Mr Dar will travel to China today at the invitation of the Chinese foreign minister and will hold in-depth discussions there.
“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the Foreign Office said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”
It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between the two countries.
Pakistan and China share longstanding strategic ties, with economic cooperation at the core of their relationship. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, continues to be described by Pakistani officials as a “lifeline” for the national economy.
In March, China further extended its financial support by rolling over a $2 billion loan for one year, easing pressure on Pakistan’s foreign exch­ange reserves and offering critical relief amid economic challenges.

The demands gain heft from the permission granted to truckers, carrying perishables from Afghanistan, to cross into India from Pakistan via Wagah. After the Pahalgam attack, India shut down the Wagah-Attari border crossing, a move reciprocated by Pakistan.
The officiating Jathedar of Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargajj, also joined the calls, urging the governments of India and Pakistan to reopen the Kartarpur corridor, especially now that the “atmosphere between the two countries is becoming more peaceful”.
Sikhs pray daily for open access to the gurdwaras from which they were separated, and therefore, keeping the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor closed is not justified, he said, adding that the corridor would further contribute to peace and harmony between the two nations and strengthen mutual ties.

Since its inauguration in 2019, a large number of Sikh devotees have been visiting the holy site in Narowal, where they bow in reverence and receive the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Hence, reopening the corridor without delay would reflect and honour the sentiments of the Sikh community.
According to Jathedar Gargajj, both nations — and the region as a whole — are in greater need of peace, progress, mutual love, and cooperation, rather than tension and conflict. He praised those national and international leaders who played a wise and compassionate role in defusing the war-like situation and promoting calm.
A separate report in Indian newspaper The Hindustan Times said the ceasefire between India and Pakistan brought renewed hope to Indian devotees, eager to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak.
Although Pakistan continued to keep its side of the corridor open, India suspended the pilgrimage on May 7. Approximately 150 Sikh pilgrims, who had arrived at the Dera Baba Nanak Integrated Check Post in India’s Gurdaspur district, were turned back after waiting over 90 minutes, as the corridor was abruptly shut after tensions rose due to the Pahalgam attack.
Nevertheless, the Sikh community remains optimistic.
 
 

Dera Baba Nanak resident Baba Sukhdeep Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak, echoed this sentiment: “The recent hostilities cast a shadow over the future of the corridor. This ceasefire is welcome news for us. We struggled for many years to see this corridor become a reality.”
The Kartarpur corridor was jointly inaugurated by the Pakistan and Indian prime ministers on November 9, 2019. It grants Indian pilgrims visa-free, dawn-to-dusk access to the revered shrine. Stretching 4.7 km, it connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib in India’s Punjab with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan.
Wagah-Attari border
While the Kartarpur corridor remains shut, the Indian government has allowed the entry of freight trucks from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan into India through the Wagah-Attari border.
Official sources said the Afghan authorities had requested the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate 162 freight trucks stuck in Pakistan due to the border closure.
“In this regard, it is intimated that the Government of India has given necessary permission to allow the aforementioned 162 trucks into India through the Wagah-Attari Border. It is further intimated that Indian Customs have made necessary arrangements to facilitate the movement of cargo in aforesaid 162 trucks,” an official document revealed.
 
 

Mukesh Sidhwani, a dry fruit trader from Amritsar, welcomed the development. “The trucks have started crossing over. So far, five trucks have crossed. This is a huge relief. The goods are semi-perishable, and every day’s delay translates into massive losses,” the report quoted him as saying.
Nearly 90 per cent of India’s trade with Afghanistan is routed through the Attari-Wagah border, which is also the only land link allowed for trade between India and Pakistan. The development came a few days after Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held his first-ever conversation with Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and underlined India’s friendship with the Afghan people and its support for their development needs.

Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement.
“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said.
Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8pc of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease.
Biden’s physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency. He abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against Republican Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats.
President Trump, who has repeatedly berated Biden since taking office in January, expressed sympathy on Sunday for Biden and his wife, Jill, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” he wrote, referring to first lady Melania Trump. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”
Former US president Barack Obama took to his X to offer sympathies and prayed for a “fast and full recovery” for Biden. Obama hoped Biden “will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”
 






Biden’s office said the cancer scored a nine out of 10 on the Gleason score grading system, which is used to help determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU Langone, said a score of nine is “very high risk,” but added that many men can live “five to 10 years and beyond” even with metastatic prostate cancer.
“Over the last decade, there have been many advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer,” he said.
Dr Chris George, the medical director of the cancer programme for the Northwestern Health Network, said prostate cancer is no longer curable once it spreads to the bones, but that there are treatments that can control it.
Biden, Trump oldest to win presidency
Biden was the oldest person to win the US presidency at the time of his election in 2020. Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last year.
Some prominent Democrats have recently acknowledged that it was an error to advance Biden as the 2024 nominee, given widespread concerns among voters about his age. Long before the debate last summer, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed a majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Biden was too old to serve a second term.
“It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, before Biden’s diagnosis was announced.
Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office, making only a handful of public appearances, including an April speech in which he defended the Social Security Administration against Trump’s planned cuts.
He has also defended his legacy in interviews and rejected reporting in two new books that he suffered from cognitive decline during his last year in office.
“They are wrong,” he said earlier this month on ABC’s “The View,” referring to the books’ authors.
Biden’s diagnosis triggered an outpouring of supportive statements on Sunday from Democrats and Republicans alike.
“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris said in a statement on X.
 






Biden lost a son, Beau Biden, in 2015 due to brain cancer.
In 2022, Biden revived an Obama-era programme known as Cancer Moonshot, seeking to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50pc over the next 25 years.</p><small>2025-05-19 03:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1907533680f9576.jpg?r=075408' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911866/questions-raised-over-rs22bn-vehicle-spending-in-fbr-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Questions raised over Rs2.2bn vehicle spending in FBR reforms</strong></a><br><p>• Planning Commission urges review of expenditure amid austerity measures
• FBR defends procurement of 179 vehicles, says it’s essential to operational needs across terrains
ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the procurement of 179 vehicles, including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division’s austerity measures.
Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister’s FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators — boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc — the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement.
“An amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,” the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation “in light of austerity measures of Finance Division”.
The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established.
 
 

“The proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,” the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027.
The estimated cost savings from the project’s investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project’s investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms.
This investment in FBR’s data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation’s ICT systems. “If the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,” the FBR advocated.
The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project’s benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc.
The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc — well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc.
The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country’s tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses.
“The cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,” the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh.
The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the digitisation of the tax system to integrate it with broader economic activity.
 
 

The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac­k­up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems.
The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the transformation plan include value chains’ digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support.
In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling.
Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan.
The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid.
The FBR expects its reform efforts to generate an additional $81bn by the end of fiscal year 2028-29. The project also covers replacement of end-of-life ICT equipment, cloud infrastructure, updated software licences, data warehousing, business intelligence tools, and complete LAN and VoIP connectivity for field offices.
As part of the Rs2.237bn allocation, the FBR will also procure 350 bulletproof jackets and helmets for operational personnel.
The tax authority defended its expanded resource needs by pointing to a fourfold increase in the number of tax filers, from 1.5m in 2017 to over 6m by the end of June 2024. It also cited the growing volume of third-party data being gathered to broaden the tax base and identify defaulters.

• ISPR DG believes ceasefire can ‘hold easily’
• Confirms CBMs from both sides
• Says Indian policy on Kashmir not working
ISLAMABAD: A ceasefire reached between Pakistan and India following days of military confrontation does not have an expiry date, officials from both countries confirmed, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.
Rumours of a Sunday deadline gained traction after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistan’s Senate last Thursday that the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed during a May 14 conversation to extend the ceasefire until May 18.
Media outlets then widely reported that the ceasefire was set to expire. However, officials from both sides clarified on Sunday that no DGMO talks were scheduled for the day and that the ceasefire, originally brokered through intensive US diplomacy, remained in force without a set end date.
“There is no expiry date to the break in hostilities, as reaffirmed in the DGMOs interaction of May 12,” an Indian official said, countering speculations of an imminent breakdown.
There was no official statement from the Pakistan Army, but a diplomat on the condition of anonymity said the ceasefire remained in effect and carried no set time frame for expiration. He said the discussions of the DGMOs were aimed at “making the ceasefire sustainable”.
 
 

The May 10 ceasefire came after the most serious escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours in over two decades, with cross-LoC shelling, drone incursions, and air force strikes pushing both sides to the brink. The United States, led by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, played a key role in mediating the truce, with support from Saudi Arabia.
Initial violations were reported on the day following the ceasefire. But since then, military commanders have engaged in constructive dialogue. The May 12 call between Pakistan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai focused on reinforcing mutual commitments to avoid any aggressive or hostile actions, officials said.
In that conversation, the two sides had agreed to begin a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, restoring the usual peacetime arrangement where the border is manned primarily by Pakistan’s Rangers and India’s Border Security Force.
Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said both DGMOs “have maintained periodic contact since May 10” and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation.
 
 

While Islamabad views the ceasefire as a potential stepping stone toward broader peace talks on long-standing issues like the Kashmir dispute and water rights, India has taken a more rigid stance.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the ceasefire as a “temporary pause,” and Defence Minister Rajnath  Singh declared that “Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation”.
‘Ceasefire will hold easily’
In comments underscoring Pakistan’s stance, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Arab News that the ceasefire was holding.
The DG ISPR also reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding position on Kashmir, warning that the dispute remains a flashpoint unless resolved through dialogue.
 


“As far as Pakistan army is concerned, this ceasefire will hold easily and there have been confidence-building measures in communication between both the sides,” he said.
“If any violation occurs, our response is always there … but it is only directed at those posts and those positions from where the violations of the ceasefire happen. We never target civilians. We never target any civil infrastructure.”
Conflict potential persists
On a separate, the Pakistani military spokesman also warned of far-reaching consequences if India attempts to follow through on threats to cut Islamabad’s share of the Indus River water system.
Last month, New Delhi unilaterally suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, blaming Pakistan for a deadly militant attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, an allegation Pakistan denies.
“Their policy on Kashmir — of oppression and trying to internalise it — is not working,” he said.
 
 

“Till the time Indians don’t sit and talk about Kashmir, then (as) two countries sit, and we find a solution to it, the conflict potential is there.” “I hope that time doesn’t come, but it will be such actions that the world will see and the consequences of that we will fight for years and decades to come,” the army spokesperson said. “Nobody dares stop water from Pakistan.”
The waters treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has survived multiple wars between the two neighbours and is considered one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally. Its potential unravelling adds a dangerous new tier to an already volatile regional equation.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said, “A storm hit several KP areas, including Charsadda, Nowshera, Peshawar and Mardan on Sunday evening.”
The storm also hit parts of the capital Islamabad.
Faizi said a 10-year-old boy, Mohammad Hamad, died when a wall of a house collapsed in the Najib Abad area of Charsadda, adding that the injured were moved to the respective areas’ hospitals.
Due to the storm, the electricity supply was suspended in many areas of the city, due to which citizens had to face severe difficulties, he said.
He said that the Disaster Response Team of Rescue 1122 was immediately dispatched to the affected areas and work was underway to remove fallen trees from the roads.
At least three people were killed in Rawalpindi and Gujar Khan last month after an intense hailstorm, accompanied by heavy rain and gusty winds, battered the region.
Heavy hailstorms struck Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing widespread damage to vehicles, windscreens, and solar panels, while also triggering flash floods following intense rainfall.</p><small>2025-05-18 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18214351d5047c3.jpg?r=214409' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911806/2-dead-11-injured-as-blast-rips-through-market-in-balochistans-qila-abdullah-officials' target='_blank'><strong>2 dead, 11 injured as blast rips through market in Balochistan’s Qila Abdullah: officials</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and at least 11 were injured after an explosion ripped through a market in Balochistan’s Qila Abdullah district on Sunday evening, officials said.
Deputy Commissioner Qila Abdullah Riyaz Khan told Dawn.com, “Two people were killed while 11 were injured in the explosion.”
According to the initial investigation, the explosives were planted in a vehicle, DC Khan said, adding that the bomb disposal squad and law enforcement officials were summoned and an investigation was launched.
“An emergency was declared at the District Health Headquarters in Qila Abdullah, where medical assistance was being provided to the injured,” he said.
In a separate statement given to Dawn.com, Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan said, “The blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.
“After the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.”
According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.
Condemning the blast, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said he shared the grief of the families of the deceased.
“The war against terrorism is undoubtedly a war of national security,” CM Bugti said in a statement, adding war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated.
“The elements involved in the Gulistan blast will be brought to an end soon,” he added.
In a separate statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said security forces were present at the spot, the area was being cordoned off, and evidence was being collected.
“The state is taking steps to protect the people by utilising all resources,” Rind said.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p><small>2025-05-18 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18114953cb0dfe3.png?r=154439' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911768/we-will-never-bow-down-to-indian-hegemony-dg-ispr-says' target='_blank'><strong>‘We will never bow down to Indian hegemony,’ DG ISPR says</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced.
“We will never bow down to Indian hegemony. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for regional peace and the world,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said to Anadolu Agency.
 


He argued that terrorism, extremism and hatred were India’s internal problems and that the New Delhi government was cracking down on groups including Muslims and Sikhs in the country, which was fuelling more anger, extremism and terrorism.
Earlier, the DG ISPR had said Pakistan is not a violent nation, reaffirming that the country’s top priority was peace as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
“We are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told RT Arabic in an interview, according to PTV News.
“Great and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan’s people is,” he added.
 






Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry’s spokesperson “personally requested a ceasefire”. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.
“We desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?” the military spokesman was quoted as saying by PTV News.
Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the “tremendous work” done by diplomats by “engaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner”.
“Pakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,” the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi’s deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets and later also intercepted dozens of its drones.
 
 

India then attacked Pakistani airbases and military targets on the night of May 9, prompting Pakistan to target its military installations using missiles and airstrikes under “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
“The nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,” he said.
Recalling the events of May 9-10, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: “The enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan’s nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.
“On the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,” he added.
The military spokesperson stressed, “Not a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.”
‘India rejected logical neutral probe’
During his conversation reported by PTV News, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was “essential to look into its background”.
“India is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,” the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan “within minutes of the Pahalgam incident”, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.
 
 

“Where is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?” Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.
He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.
“India rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,” the DG ISPR said.
“The sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country’s sovereignty and borders,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would “continue to do so at all costs”.
 
 

The DG ISPR reiterated the military’s stance that India was “sponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan”.
“India is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the khawarij or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as Fitna Al Khawarij.

Last week, War Mamond Police Station House Officer Niaz Mohammad said that a suspect allegedly shot dead a 28-year-old married woman, and then killed a 33-year-old man. He added the suspect’s gunfire also hit a 70-year-old woman, who was pronounced dead at the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar, after suffering serious injuries.
 
 

The police officer, who visited the site of the incident, said that the suspect fled after committing the crime, saying the 28-year-old was said to be the relative of the killer. However, he had said that efforts were underway to arrest the suspected killer after registering a case against him.
According to a statement issued today by the HRCP, the organisation strongly condemned the murder of three individuals in the Bajaur district.
“Such acts of violence are a gross violation of the right to life and reflect deeply entrenched patriarchal norms,” the statement said.
 






In a post on X, the organisation urged authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation, ensuring that the perpetrators are held accountable under the law and that the incident is treated as a non-compoundable offence.
“The state must become a party in all such cases,” it said.
In Pakistan, honour killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-05-18 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1820002476f6471.jpg?r=200753' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911802/verstappen-wins-emilia-romagna-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>Verstappen wins Emilia Romagna Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won a gripping Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Sunday, holding off the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton produced a rousing display for the Italian fans, taking his Ferrari from 12th on the grid to finish in fourth with teammate Charles Leclerc adding further cheer for the tifosi as he brought home the second Ferrari in sixth.

The bodies were moved to the Teaching Hospital Panjgur and were consequently handed over to the heirs, he said.
The deputy commissioner added that an investigation into the killings was underway and action was being taken to arrest the suspects.

“Flynas resumed Iranian pilgrims flights from Imam Khomeini (airport) in Tehran on Saturday,” a Saudi civil aviation authority official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The official said flights would also be added from Mashhad in Iran, allowing more than 35,000 pilgrims to travel to Saudi Arabia on the airline. Flynas is a budget airline based in Saudi Arabia, which operates domestic and international routes.
The official stressed that the flights were not commercial and were only for the Haj pilgrimage.
The Haj is due to begin during the first week of June, and pilgrims from across the globe have already begun pouring into Saudi Arabia.

Shiite-dominated Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia resumed relations in March 2023 under a surprise China-brokered deal after a seven-year rupture.
Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran in 2016 after its embassy in Tehran and consulate in the northwestern city of Mashhad were attacked during protests after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
No Iranian pilgrims were allowed into Saudi Arabia in 2016, the year that ties were ruptured, as the two sides were unable to organise a protocol for them to attend.
In September 2015, a stampede during the Haj killed up to 2,300 worshippers, among them hundreds of Iranians.
Pilgrims from Iran were later allowed to join the Haj but were only allowed to travel to Saudi Arabia on Iranian chartered flights during the Haj season.
But since the March 2023 Iranian-Saudi rapprochement, the regional powers have intensified their contacts.
The two exchanged ambassadors and visits of foreign ministers before the late Ebrahim Raisi made the first visit by an Iranian president to the kingdom in 20 years for a joint Arab-Islamic summit on the Israeli invasion of Gaza in November 2023.
In December, Iran Air resumed operations between Mashhad and Dammam in eastern Saudi Arabia.
And last month, Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman travelled in a rare visit by a Saudi royal to Iran where he also met supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The moves come as the United States and Iran have held four rounds of talks aimed at hammering out a new accord on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
US President Donald Trump hinted during his tour of the Gulf that the two sides were “getting close” to a deal, but also warned Tehran to move quickly towards sealing an agreement or “something bad will happen”.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Saudi Arabia just days before Trump began his regional tour last week.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1819152880b2787.jpg?r=192230' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911793/govt-achieved-economic-revival-under-pm-shehbaz-will-provide-relief-in-next-budget-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Govt achieved economic revival under PM Shehbaz, will provide relief in next budget: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Sunday that the country has achieved economic revival under the leadership of PM Shehaz Sharif, assuring the provision of relief to the public in the upcoming budget.
The government will present the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2. PM Shehbaz has assured that providing relief to the common man in the upcoming budget was the government’s priority, and all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and middle class.
A delegation comprising the PML-N leader, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Energy Minister Awais Leghari called on Governor Sindh Kamran Tessori in Karachi today, while MQM leaders Farooq Sattar, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Faisal Sabwari, and Nasrin Jalil were also present on the occasion.
Addressing the media after the meeting, Sanaullah said that Pakistan had emerged out of an economic crisis due to the untiring efforts of the economic team comprising the finance minister and PM Shehbaz.
“The country achieved economic revival under the leadership of the prime minister, and now, in the upcoming budget, there will be good news for the common man,” Sanaullah said.
He added the recent conflict with India had shown the world that Pakistan was a responsible nation and that the armed forces and their chiefs deserved the nation’s gratitude for the victory.
Sanaullah also assured that the government will present a budget that will push the country towards economic prosperity.
Speaking on the occasion, MQM’s Sattar said that maximum relief should be given to the common man in the upcoming budget and the burden on the salaried class should be reduced.
“During today’s meeting, we discussed the reforms suggested by the IMF (International Monetary Fund), including increasing agriculture tax on landlords,” he said, adding that if taxes could be imposed on the salaried class, direct taxes could be imposed to expand the tax base, too.
Sattar said the government should improve the urban packages for Karachi and Hyderabad, and expedite the completion of the K-IV water project, which the prime minister had assured will be completed by December 2026.
He added the funds allocated for road infrastructure in Karachi should not lapse and instead be increased for the next fiscal year so that the problems of sanitation and road repair affecting the city are resolved.
Governor Tessori pointed out how India attempted to stop the disbursement of the next tranche of IMF funds during the conflict, “but it was eventually approved due to the efforts of the finance minister.”
He said the MQM leaders briefed the delegation and business leaders on the urban projects in Karachi.
“Pakistan will achieve economic and political stability within the next year, and we will give a message to India when we celebrate the first anniversary of our May 10 victory,” he said.
The PML-N delegation arrived in Karachi and earlier met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and PPP’s Naveed Qamar at the CM House.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1818021170d42e6.jpg?r=180216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911796/peace-committee-member-killed-in-exchange-of-fire-with-militants-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peace committee member killed in exchange of fire with militants in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>A peace committee member lost his life during an exchange with militants in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, police said on Sunday.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
According to a police statement, “Around 50 militants attacked the Begukhel village with small and heavy weapons on Saturday night in an apparent revenge act.”
The peace committee and local people responded vigorously, according to the statement.
“During the two-hour-long encounter, a volunteer of the peace committee was killed,” it said.
A search operation is underway in the area by the police and security forces, the statement added.
On Thursday, the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos launched a joint operation against terrorists in rural areas of the district.
Last month, local elders announced that they would fight anti-peace elements side by side with police to effectively eradicate the menace of terrorism from the district.
On April 28, the killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605086-sindh-to-establish-mini-truck-assembly-line-in-karachi-in-collaboration-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh to establish mini truck assembly line in Karachi in collaboration with China</strong></a><br><p>

Trump’s return to power has energised eurosceptics across Europe, and Sunday’s ballot will be the biggest test of Tusk’s pro-European vision since he came to power in 2023, ousting the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.
The election pits Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Tusk’s Civic Coalition, against conservative historian Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by PiS.
Trzaskowski has been cast as the frontrunner, likely to face Nawrocki in a run-off, due on June 1, if no candidate wins over 50 per cent. Voting ends on Sunday at 9pm (12am Pakistan Standard Time), with exit polls expected soon afterwards and results trickling in overnight and on Monday.
Also competing are far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen from the Confederation party, Parliament Speaker Szymon Holownia of the centre-right Poland 2050 and Magdalena Biejat from the Left.
State news agency PAP reported that Nawrocki encouraged all Poles to take part in the election after voting in Gdansk, saying it was important because “we are shaping our future”.
Trzaskowski said that “every election is a celebration of democracy” after voting in Warsaw. The electoral commission said voting was proceeding calmly.
Czeslaw Wegorek, a 64-year-old courier who was voting in the northern port city of Gdansk, said he wanted someone focused on the future of the population, “not more quarrels”.
Warsaw resident Barbara Zurawska said that for her, housing for young people was a key issue.
“It’s really hard for young people now. They live with their parents for a very long time, and it’s hard to take out loans and repay them,” she said.
Europe under pressure
The Polish first-round vote takes place on the same day as a second-round presidential run-off in Romania, where George Simion, a nationalist who campaigns to “Make Romania Great Again”, faces centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.
A victory for two eurosceptic candidates would send shockwaves through the European Union as the bloc grapples with the twin challenges of Russia’s invasion of Poland’s eastern neighbour Ukraine and Trump’s tariffs.
The Polish president has limited executive powers but can veto legislation. That has allowed outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, to stymie efforts by Tusk to undo judicial changes implemented under PiS, which Tusk says hamper democracy.
Trzaskowski has pledged to cement Poland’s role as a major player at the heart of European policymaking and work with the government to roll back PiS’s judicial changes.
Nawrocki’s campaign was rocked by allegations, which he denies, that he deceived an elderly man into selling him a flat in return for a promise of care he did not provide. But Trump showed support by meeting Nawrocki in the White House.
Nawrocki casts the election as a chance to stop Tusk from achieving unchecked power and push back against liberal values represented by Trzaskowski, who as Warsaw mayor patronised LGBT marches and took down Christian crosses from public buildings.
Unlike some other eurosceptics in central Europe, Nawrocki supports military aid to help Ukraine fend off Russia. However, he has tapped into anti-Ukrainian sentiment among some Poles weary of an influx of refugees from their neighbour.
He has said Polish citizens should get priority in public services and criticised Kyiv’s attitude to exhumations of the remains of Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War Two.</p><small>2025-05-18 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605069-deputy-pm-dar-to-visit-china-tomorrow-amid-pakistan-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Deputy PM Dar set to visit China today amid Pakistan-India tensions</strong></a><br><p>

The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.
“In a telephonic conversation with Chairman Pakistan People’s Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him,” the report said.
The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report added.
“It will also underscore Pakistan’s sincere efforts for peace and stability in the region.”
Yesterday, former foreign minister Bilawal, in a post on X, announced that he was appointed by the premier to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
 






In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-18 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605066-red-alert-issued-for-punjab-as-heatwave-likely-to-intensify' target='_blank'><strong>Red alert issued for Punjab as heatwave likely to intensify</strong></a><br><p>

With this latest accomplishment, he becomes the first Pakistani in history to complete all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks — commonly referred to as the eight-thousanders — without any oxygen support, a feat achieved by only a handful of elite mountaineers globally.
Sirbaz had earlier become the first Pakistani climber to have summited all 14 mountains with the height of over 8,000m in the world in October last year.
 






Imagine Nepal, the tour organisers of Sirbaz in a statement congratulated the climber, saying, “ We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Mr Sirbaz Khan — our dear friend, client, and partner from Pakistan — on his incredible achievement of summiting Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, without supplemental oxygen this morning, May 18, 2025.
Alpine Club of Pakistan Secretary Karrar Haidri, said, “With this summit, Sirbaz Khan becomes the first Pakistani to climb all 14 highest peaks without oxygen.
“Sirbaz Khan has made the entire nation proud. Completing all 14 eight-thousanders without oxygen is a rare and heroic achievement. He is a symbol of Pakistani resilience, skill, and courage on the highest peaks of the world,” he added.
Sirbaz achieved a landmark in the history of high-altitude climbing by successfully summiting Mt. Kangchenjunga this morning at 5:00am local time (4:15am PKT).
What makes this feat extraordinary is that Sirbaz scaled the world’s third-highest mountain without the use of supplementary oxygen, in true alpine style — marking a defining moment in Pakistan’s mountaineering legacy.
Sirbaz’s journey to this historic milestone has spanned over a decade of determination, discipline, and sheer courage. He has successfully scaled the following 14 peaks over 8,000m — all without bottled oxygen:

Everest (8,848m)
K2 (8,611m)
Kangchenjunga (8,586m)
Lhotse (8,516m)
Makalu (8,485m)
Cho Oyu (8,188m)
Dhaulagiri (8,167m)
Manaslu (8,163m)
Nanga Parbat (8,126m)
Annapurna I (8,091m)
Gasherbrum I (8,080m)
Broad Peak (8,051m)
Gasherbrum II (8,035m)
Shishapangma (8,027m)

This record-breaking summit of Mt. Kangchenjunga not only cements Sirbaz Khan’s place among the greatest mountaineers of all time but also brings immense pride to the people of Pakistan, particularly the mountaineering community of Gilgit-Baltistan, where Sirbaz hails from.
His accomplishment was made in the spirit of pure alpine climbing — minimal gear, no fixed ropes or camps set by Sherpas, and no oxygen support — a style that represents the truest and most demanding form of mountaineering.
Sirbaz’s mission has always been to represent Pakistan on the world’s highest stages and inspire the next generation of climbers to follow his path with the same passion and perseverance.
Sirbaz, 35, hails from the Aliabad area of Hunza in Gilgit-Baltistan and began his climbing career in 2016.
On four of these expeditions, he had been accompanied by late Muhammad Ali Sadpara.
Before setting on the mission to summit Dhaulagiri peak last year, he had said: “I am looking forward to his expedition and reaching closer to the dream of my mentor Ali Sadpara, who had the similar dream of scaling the 14 highest peaks, but tragically lost his life earlier this year during a winter expedition on K2.”
Pakistani climbers including Naila Kiani, Sajid Sadpara, civil society members, and politicians have congratulated Sirbaz for his historical feat.</p><small>2025-05-18 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18140259e593f5a.jpg?r=141104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911778/pakistan-aims-to-bridge-south-and-central-asian-economies-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan aims to bridge South and Central Asian economies: minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan has said that Pakistan aims to emerge as a key transit hub, bridging the economies of South Asia and Central Asia, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
A high-level delegation from Pakistan, led by the federal minister, participated in the Kazan Forum organised under the auspices of the Russian Federation in the capital of Tatarstan.
“Gwadar Port has already started shipment and cargo services, while Pakistan intends to facilitate Central Asia’s access to warm waters,” Radio Pakistan quoted the minister as saying while addressing the closing session.
Aleem said the Mazar-i-Sharif to Kohat Railway Project is expected to cost around $633 million. He spoke about Pakistan’s strategic plans to connect Karachi, Quetta and Gwadar cities with Central Asia and Europe through road networks.
The minister welcomed the holding of the Kazan Forum and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to playing an active role in regional development.
On the opening day on Friday, while addressing the session on Cultural Dialogue, the minister emphasised that Pakistan possesses a rich historical and social heritage, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
He welcomed cultural exchanges with Russia and Central Asian states, terming such initiatives a positive and promising step towards achieving a peaceful world and paving the way for harmony.
Aleem underscored the importance of preserving multifaceted cultural heritage and stressed that through mutual dialogue and understanding, the world can become more peaceful, diverse and harmonious.
He appreciated the organisation of the ‘Russia-Islamic World Kazan Forum 2025’ and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to playing an active role in the region, particularly in the communications sector, to enhance trade and strengthen the national economy.
On the sidelines of the forum, the minister held a meeting with the chairman of Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. They discussed matters related to shipping and cargo logistics between Pakistan and Dubai ports.
Aleem highlighted Pakistan’s keen interest in ‘North to South’ land connectivity and noted that the country is modernising its communications infrastructure. He mentioned that in the first phase, the use of M-Tag has been made mandatory for toll collection on motorways and highways.
The chairman of the Dubai ports expressed strong interest in expanding bilateral trade relations and deliberated on various projects, including investing in Pakistan’s M6, M9, and N-25 Highways.

Well-wishers in the crowd waved US and Peruvian flags, with people from both countries claiming him as the first pope from their nations.
Born in Chicago, the 69-year-old pontiff spent many years as a missionary in Peru and also has Peruvian citizenship.
Crowds chanted “Viva il Papa” (Long Live the Pope) and “Papa Leone”, his name in Italian, as his distinctive, open-topped popemobile weaved around St. Peter’s Square.
Robert Prevost, a relative unknown on the world stage who only became a cardinal two years ago, was elected pope on May 8 after a short conclave of cardinals that lasted barely 24 hours.
He succeeded Francis, an Argentine, who died on April 21 after leading the Church for 12 often turbulent years during which he battled with traditionalists and championed the poor and marginalised.
US Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert who clashed with Francis over the White House’s hardline immigration policies, led a US delegation alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic.
Vance briefly shook hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the start of the ceremony. The two men last met in February in the White House, when they clashed fiercely in front of the world’s media.
In his sermon, read in fluent Italian, Leo said that as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, he would not shrink before modern challenges and that, at least on social issues such as combating poverty and protecting the environment, he would continue the legacy of Pope Francis.
Leo said the cardinals who elected him had chosen someone “capable of preserving the rich heritage of the Christian faith and, at the same time, looking to the future, in order to confront the questions, concerns and challenges of today’s world”.
Appeal for unity
Francis’ papacy left a divided Church, with conservatives accusing him of sowing confusion, particularly with his extemporaneous remarks on issues of sexual morality such as same-sex unions.
Saying he was taking up his mission “with fear and trembling”, Leo used the words “unity” or “united” seven times and the word “harmony” four times.
“It is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power. Instead, it is always and only a question of loving, as Jesus did,” he said, in an apparent reference to a war of words between Catholics who define themselves as conservative or progressive.
“Brothers and sisters, I would like that our first great desire be for a united Church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world,” he said.
Conservatives also accused Francis of ruling in a heavy-handed way and lamented that he belittled their concerns and did not consult widely before making decisions.
Referring to St. Peter, the 1st century Christian apostle from whom popes derive their authority, Leo said: “Peter must shepherd the flock without ever yielding to the temptation to be an autocrat, lording it over those entrusted to him. On the contrary, he is called to serve the faith of his brothers and sisters, and to walk alongside them.”
Underscoring the unbroken lineage of popes from St. Peter, the choir chanted the traditional hymn “Tu es Petrus”, Latin for “You are Peter”.
Many world leaders attended the ceremony, including the presidents of Peru, Israel and Nigeria, the prime ministers of Italy, Canada and Australia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. European royals also took their place in the VIP seats near the main altar, including Spanish King Felipe and Queen Letizia.
As part of the ceremony, Leo received two symbolic items: a liturgical vestment known as a pallium, a sash of lambswool representing his role as a shepherd, and the “fisherman’s ring”, recalling the first pope, St. Peter, who was a fisherman.
The ceremonial gold signet ring is specially cast for each new pope and can be used by Leo to seal documents, although this purpose has fallen out of use in modern times. It shows St. Peter holding the keys to Heaven and will be broken after his death or resignation.</p><small>2025-05-18 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605044-first-in-pakistan-sirbaz-khan-scales-all-8000m-peaks-without-supplemental-oxygen' target='_blank'><strong>First in Pakistan, Sirbaz Khan scales all 8,000m peaks without supplemental oxygen</strong></a><br><p>

The large blaze broke out in the early hours of the day in a three-storey building which houses a jewellery store.
A statement from the fire disaster response emergency and civil defence department in southern Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located, said they had received the call for help just after 6am local time (5:30am PKT).
“The fire broke out on the ground floor and spread to the upper floors. Firefighting, search & rescue operations were carried out simultaneously,” it said.
The statement also listed the names of 17 individuals who lost their lives.
“The suspected cause of the fire is under investigation,” it said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his “deep grief” over the loss of life and announced compensation of 200,000 rupees (around $2,300) to the next of kin of each victim.
“Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana,” Modi said in a statement released by his office.
“Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
Last month, a fierce fire broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-05-18 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18133214ef3cb74.jpg?r=133422' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911660/daughter-of-sc-judge-absolved-of-charges-in-hit-and-run-case' target='_blank'><strong>Daughter of SC judge absolved of charges in hit-and-run case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After fighting his case for about three years, father of a victim of the high profile hit-and-run case finally withdrew appeal against the acquittal of the daughter of a Supreme Court judge.
The matter was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Rafaqat Ali, father of Shakeel Tanoli, had lodged FIR with the Khanna Police Station, Islamabad on June 19, 2022.
A local court of Islamabad had acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan in February.
As per the FIR, a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by the daughter of the Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan ran over two Savour Foods workers near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway at midnight and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.

Victim’s father says he lodged FIR out of misunderstanding

As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague Hasnain Ali were going home after the work when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
While the judge’s family reportedly reached a settlement with the family of Hasnain Ali, Rafaqat Ali vowed to pursue the case legally.
Rafaqat Ali has now changed his mind and stated in the affidavit that he nominated Shanzay Malik because of misunderstanding.
He further stated that he verified with different sources and found that neither Ms Malik nor anyone from his family was involved in the incident.
“Subsequently, I am withdrawing the appeal in this case and have no objection over her acquittal in the case.”
According to the details brought to the judicial record, the woman fled, leaving behind the vehicle.
The police took the vehicle into custody, which was later given to an official of the Lahore High Court on ‘superdari’ in July 2024 upon assurance that ‘he shall produce the vehicle in the court as and when required’.
In July 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that the luxury vehicle of the Lahore High Court (LHC) involved in hit and run case in which two persons were killed was driven by a woman and was in the use of Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed, who was elevated to the Supreme Court after the incident.
In February this year, judge’s daughter Shanzay Malik was acquitted by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.
Advocate Siddique Awan, counsel for Ms Malik, argued before the court that police could not produce any substantial evidence as the entire story of prosecution was based on secondary facts.
He argued that the case was registered 11 days after the accident, and the police could not give any explanation for the delay. He contended that the police could not produce any video evidence, and the photos submitted in the court did not clearly identify his client.
He also pointed out that Shanzay Malik was nominated only after the plaintiff’s delayed statement in July 2024.
Earlier, reports indicated that Ms Malik had been granted pre-arrest bail after being on the run for more than two years.
Legal proceedings saw the deletion of Section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (causing death by rash or negligent driving), which is a non-bailable offence, and replacing it with Section 320 (causing death without intent), a bailable offence.
Rafaqat Ali has challenged the acquittal order before the Islamabad High Court.
Following submission of the affidavit, IHC Justice Mohammad Asif dismissed the appeal against acquittal.

The blast tore through downtown Palm Springs, ripping a hole in the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of nearby buildings, an AFP journalist on the scene reported.
“Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, told reporters near the site of the fatal explosion.
“This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we’ve had in southern California,” he added.
He confirmed that one person near the clinic at the time of the blast had been killed and that four others were wounded. Work was ongoing to identify the deceased, he added.
Asked whether the clinic was deliberately targeted, Davis answered: “We believe so, yes.”
The city’s mayor, Ron deHarte had earlier told AFP that investigators confirmed a bomb exploded in or near a vehicle outside the clinic.
Eyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centres clinic, with aerial footage of the scene showing the building’s roof had collapsed.
Debris for ‘several blocks’
The charred remnants of a vehicle lay in a parking lot, some distance from the apparent epicentre of the explosion.
Debris was blown straight through the building and scattered across the road, while the roofs of a number of nearby buildings had been damaged, indicating the intense force of the blast.
Davis of the FBI described the explosion as “significant” and said debris had been thrown more than two hundred yards (180 meters) from the scene, but declined to comment further on the characteristics of the bomb.
The local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, said the person who died was a suspect in the blast.
Davis told reporters that though the FBI was working to identify the deceased, “we are keeping that close hold in order to protect the integrity of the investigation”.
A statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt, and that its lab — “including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials — remains fully secure and undamaged.”
It said that “a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building.”
Reproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remains controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons.
Violence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of.
‘Unforgivable’
President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to determine exactly what had happened.
“But let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,” she said in a statement on social media.
People living near the clinic reported feeling the shaking from the blast throughout the city.
Matt Spencer, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, told the Palm Springs Post he ran outside as soon as he heard the blast, and was confronted with the sight of the burned-out car and what appeared to be a body in the middle of the road.
“In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of [Desert Regional Medical Centre],” he told the paper.
“I could see the back of the car still on fire, and the rims, that was the only thing that distinguished it as a car.”
The Centre for Reproductive Rights, a global advocacy group, described the bombing as “horrific” and “unconscionable.”
“The history of violence against reproductive health centres is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe,” its president, Nancy Northup, said in a statement.</p><small>2025-05-18 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605021-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-hit-by-nearly-300-terror-attacks-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa hit by nearly 300 terror attacks in 2025</strong></a><br><p>
